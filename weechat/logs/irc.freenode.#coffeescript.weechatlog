2013-08-31 02:04:03	melvinram	Hmm, thanks. I'll look into Promise. I ended up doing it through callbacks but I don't really like the code… though it does work well.
2013-08-31 02:04:18	deltab	I didn't know about the pipe method, but it looks like it's just what you need
2013-08-31 02:04:55	melvinram	I'm looking through it now

2013-08-31 02:22:26	Vitaliy_	hello
2013-08-31 02:23:10	Vitaliy_	I need a simple program which would watch/compile/minify coffeescript files
2013-08-31 02:23:38	Vitaliy_	it can be very simple something like:
2013-08-31 02:24:07	Vitaliy_	fancycoffee --compile --watch --minify coffee1.coffee coffee2.coffee
2013-08-31 02:24:12	Vitaliy_	any suggestions?

2013-08-31 02:36:13	deltab	Vitaliy_: coffee itself will do the watching and compiling parts of that
2013-08-31 02:36:49	deltab	but not the minifying; I don't have anything to recommend for that
2013-08-31 02:37:46	Vitaliy_	ahh right, yeah thats the feature that I mostly need
2013-08-31 02:39:20	Vitaliy_	ive been using yuicompressor but that's another step i need to do every time i make a change
2013-08-31 02:40:20	deltab	there are programs to handle that, but I don't know any in particular
2013-08-31 02:41:26	Vitaliy_	ok thank you

2013-08-31 15:16:55	deltab	etcetera: you mean `...`?
2013-08-31 15:17:58	ingsoc	used gwt, to avoid JS, decided bloated, JS seems not so bad in retrospect, but now found coffeescript.  what is it like for debugging, are there any step debuggers for it (IDE's ?) .  One  thing i do like about GWT is the component/class based UI components that are parts of DOM that are also linked (encapsulated) within java classes which are built up dynamically and then attached to the DOM where required.
2013-08-31 15:18:04	ingsoc	 e.g. you can create a "form" widget/component that knows how to create all of it's form fields/controls and also takes care of their event handlers as methods on itself.  I am fairly new to web development but it seems in raw JS people tend to just have bare functions or anonymous functions created as event handlers with no kind of encapsulation.  Do people use coffeescript to create components in the sense of gwt d
2013-08-31 15:18:58	ingsoc	sorry for the long post
2013-08-31 15:19:06	ingsoc	has anything been cut off ?
2013-08-31 15:19:20	deltab	ingsoc: yes, with source maps debuggers such as web inspector can map locations in the js back to coffeescript code, which they display
2013-08-31 15:19:32	deltab	"sense of gwt d"
2013-08-31 15:19:45	ingsoc	escribed above as it has a nicer/easier object definition syntax ?
2013-08-31 15:20:06	ingsoc	(easiedr than raw JS)
2013-08-31 15:20:27	ingsoc	also i seem to have learned a fair bit about JS just reading the examples on the coffeescript website
2013-08-31 15:20:28	ingsoc	:)
2013-08-31 15:20:44	ingsoc	(the JS equivalent)

2013-08-31 15:21:51	deltab	very likely: there are all sorts of component frameworks
2013-08-31 15:22:14	ingsoc	i like the look of kendoui

2013-08-31 15:23:51	ingsoc	but obv the components still  require static html (e.g. <ul>/<li> that  they use to build their menu/menu items) and also some config options and the event handlers

2013-08-31 15:24:59	ingsoc	I was thinking that I could create object components that then takes an array or object for the menu items then creates the html dom element and attaches to the DOM and then calls the kendoui stuff to initialise it
2013-08-31 15:25:28	ingsoc	so it is a single encapsulated component
2013-08-31 15:25:52	ingsoc	deltab: what frameworks you talking about ?

2013-09-10 22:58:41	milkandtang	I'm not sure if it's entirely clear, but the sensorTag.readDeviceName function takes only one parameter which is a callback that gets passed a devideName
2013-09-10 22:59:03	milkandtang	I want to return that deviceName to get it into the variable above
2013-09-10 22:59:33	milkandtang	if I console.log deviceName within my anonymous function, I can see the deviceName, but the variable I'm trying to fill remains undefined
2013-09-10 22:59:39	milkandtang	any help would be super appreciated

2013-09-13 23:32:45	sukima	(updated gist)
2013-09-13 23:33:35	Vendethiel	sukima: fyi, coco (and, so, livescript) allows it, and even `a{b, c}`
2013-09-13 23:33:43	kenn	sukima, this is probably not the answer you're looking for, but underscore has a function called "pick" which does what you want http://underscorejs.org/#pick
2013-09-13 23:34:11	Vendethiel	on that note, Lodash 2!
2013-09-13 23:34:12	Vendethiel	:p
2013-09-13 23:34:37	kenn	yes, or that one :)
2013-09-13 23:35:00	sukima	Lodash vs lodash2 vs underscore === confused. care to help?
2013-09-13 23:36:21	kenn	with underscore you can do _.pick (foo:1,bar:2), "foo", which will return {foo:1}
2013-09-13 23:36:39	kenn	I'm not familiar with lodash, but I suspect it can do something similar

2013-09-16 02:08:15	snkcld	does this make sense? @game = new TicTacToe(new Player("x", new HumanStrategy(@game)), new Player("o", new AIStrategy(@game)))
2013-09-16 02:08:37	snkcld	that is, setting @game but referencing it later on the right of the expression?
2013-09-16 02:08:56	snkcld	it seems to work, but i dont want to rely upon it if its something that can mess me up later
2013-09-16 02:23:37	deltab	it'll get the value before
2013-09-16 02:24:17	snkcld	so on the right side, @game will get null, if @game was never set?
2013-09-16 02:24:26	deltab	first it gets @game, passes it to new HumanStrategy, then to new Player, and likewise with the other
2013-09-16 02:24:31	deltab	yes
2013-09-16 02:25:26	snkcld	yea thats what i was afraid of... but if its passing by reference, its ok, right? because @game will be updated once the evaluation completes?

2013-09-16 11:28:36	lite_	right

2013-09-16 11:29:06	thomaslindstr_m	"true" or true will always return "true" because strings are truey
2013-09-16 11:29:19	thomaslindstr_m	so you're in practice checking, always, if foo is "true"
2013-09-16 11:30:15	lite_	so how would you check if something is "true" or the boolean true ?
2013-09-16 11:31:03	thomaslindstr_m	hm firstly why would something return a string with true?

2013-09-16 11:33:18	lite_	or false
2013-09-16 11:34:29	thomaslindstr_m	i'd do something like this

2013-09-16 11:36:03	thomaslindstr_m	if foo can only be true, undefined, "false" or "true"

2013-09-16 15:21:48	phrearch	hi thomaslindstr_m
2013-09-16 15:22:02	caitp	somefunc -> ...
2013-09-16 15:22:10	phrearch	i have like (param1, param2, ->) ->
2013-09-16 15:22:20	caitp	er
2013-09-16 15:22:31	caitp	wot
2013-09-16 15:22:41	phrearch	caitp: well, the third param is a function
2013-09-16 15:22:57	thomaslindstr_m	pass a function as an argument and executable function?
2013-09-16 15:23:07	thomaslindstr_m	or pre-executed
2013-09-16 15:23:25	phrearch	ehm, preexecuted. its a callback for async.each
2013-09-16 15:23:34	phrearch	async.each rows, (row, next, ->) ->
2013-09-16 15:23:51	phrearch	im not sure how to put in that function with coffeescript
2013-09-16 15:23:53	phrearch	inline
2013-09-16 15:23:58	thomaslindstr_m	how would you do it in javascript?
2013-09-16 15:24:06	caitp	if I have a function `func = (data, cb) -> ` which expects cb to be a function, I could call it with `func {}= some data, -> . my func`

2013-09-16 15:33:41	phrearch	with the extra () , you can add another function?
2013-09-16 15:35:00	caitp	well, you could use indentation instead
2013-09-16 15:35:20	caitp	and spread the function call onto multiple lines
2013-09-16 15:35:47	caitp	but the wrapping parens let you be a bit more concise
2013-09-16 15:37:14	thomaslindstr_m	phrearch: yeah just add a comma and then a new function like before
2013-09-16 15:37:44	phrearch	thomaslindstr_m:  that worked fine. thanks
2013-09-16 15:37:48	thomaslindstr_m	async.each myArray, ((item) -> console.log item), ((err, res) -> console.log err, res)
2013-09-16 15:37:51	thomaslindstr_m	no problem
2013-09-16 15:39:31	caitp	you can even call an anonymous function and pass the result (although this is silly)

2013-09-20 01:13:48	Leeol	Currently, coffee.stdout is outputting *nothing*. I think this is due to the fact that the `coffee -s` process needs to be stopped with something like Ctrl-D, and to the best of my attempts i cannot get it to work
2013-09-20 01:14:07	caitp	mm
2013-09-20 01:14:15	Leeol	Eg, if you run `coffee -s` in your terminal and type some coffee, nothing happens. You need to signal the end of your input with Ctrl-D, and then it compiles what you typed
2013-09-20 01:15:15	Leeol	Ctrl-D, i believe, is kill('SIGQUIT'), but that results in no data being printed to stdout. Same goes for `coffeeProcess.stdin.write('\x04')` which should be the ASCII code for Ctrl-D

2013-09-20 02:05:05	Leeol	deltab: I tried that, it says no method exists. I'm toying all over the place, and i am starting to feel like something weird is going on, possibly unrelated to coffee. I can't even pipe `coffee -h` to my process.stdout at the moment, but i *can* pipe `ls .` to my process.stdout. Something is wonky.. *mindexploding*

2013-09-20 02:07:34	Leeol	Actually, even `spawn('coffee', ['-h']).stdin.close()` fails ..
2013-09-20 02:09:08	Leeol	That is to say, the method does not exist
2013-09-20 02:13:35	Leeol	deltab: Try it yourself, https://gist.github.com/leeolayvar/11094d1cd3c43a717c0c
2013-09-20 02:13:43	Leeol	ending seemingly does nothing
2013-09-20 02:14:20	Leeol	I'm starting to feel like Coffee's STDIO is broke, but it works in my console manually, so i feel it can't be that. o_O

2013-09-20 15:38:38	sukima	You should test function not implementation

2013-09-20 15:39:41	Leeol	sukima: The only support for streaming, that i am aware of, is `coffee -s`
2013-09-20 15:39:53	mackwerk	Hello, I'm writing a hubot script and on this page http://theprogrammingbutler.com/blog/archives/2011/10/28/hubot-scripts-explained/ under the 'http' header the author does some interesting things with strings eg msg.send "   gem name: #{json.name}\n" but I cannot get that to work with this script: https://dpaste.de/P1efN/ it just outputs what is in the string without formatting them, what am I doing wrong? :o
2013-09-20 15:41:07	sukima	Leeol: I have no idea what you mean by streaming? socket.io?

2013-09-20 15:44:51	sukima	So you have a test that will read input from a coffee compilation and match it to a previously compiled version to see if they are equal? that doesn't sound like a good test. Why not readin the stream and do a simple regexp. Like if it's size is > 0 or that it has a CoffeeScript header like you said (ignoring the version number). Besides CoffeeScript is very well tested on it's own you should need to test it's output

2013-09-20 15:46:35	sukima	Still sounds brittle. What if you wrote unit tests for the actual function of the code that why no mater how CS compiles it you know it behaves the same way regardles of syntax changes

2013-09-20 15:49:59	sukima	Well. You could add comments specific for testing and see if they all exists in the output. like ### FILE xyz FOR TESTING build 123
2013-09-20 15:50:36	Leeol	Sure, but then what about the coffee changes (or whatever) i mentioned? There are some things that i *want* to be brittle
2013-09-20 15:50:37	sukima	Then CS puts that into the generated code as a comment and you can do a simple regexp to see if it is there. That way you know all the parts are there in your test without having to worry about what the parts look like
2013-09-20 15:51:06	Leeol	If coffee changes what it considers compiled output, i want to know. I already dislike some coffee output haha
2013-09-20 15:51:07	sukima	Sounds like you have a headache. Wish you luck
2013-09-20 15:51:23	Leeol	Well, hopefully coffee won't go about changing it's syntax all crazy like lol.
2013-09-20 15:51:40	Leeol	I was curious why you prefer double quotes as well (in short)
2013-09-20 15:52:29	sukima	Because the difference between double quotes and single is that doub;e allows string interpolation. And in a compiled language performance is not an issue so might as well make it all consistant
2013-09-20 15:52:44	mackwerk	sukima, but single quotes looks nicer :(
2013-09-20 15:52:59	sukima	I disagree. but now it's down to opinion
2013-09-20 15:53:02	Leeol	Ah hah. I prefer both, because, as mackwerk  says, i prefer the look of single. Plus, i read it as mutable, and immutable.
2013-09-20 15:53:09	sukima	I think double quotes look nicer

2013-09-20 15:53:29	Leeol	I like seeing a single quote string and knowing it's exactly that, and nothing else, but it's a small preference
2013-09-20 15:53:47	sukima	And how does that help you make better code?
2013-09-20 15:53:52	Leeol	At least we can all agree about preferences haha
2013-09-20 15:54:22	mackwerk	I think the main reason why i prefer single quotes is that I don't have to use a modifier on my keyboard to make it, so it's faster :D
2013-09-20 15:54:43	Leeol	sukima: Who says it doesn't? I don't need to quantify my preferences to myself. Now, if it causes me significant issues or performance loss, then i should look at it, but otherwise i live my life like non-type casted languages haha
2013-09-20 15:54:52	sukima	For me seeing a single quote means I have to remember it means something else while a double quote is by habbit just a string which I can add interpolation if I want to or not. With single quotes I have to remember to go back and change them if I want to add a variab;le
2013-09-20 15:55:30	Leeol	sukima: Yea, i can definitely see the desire to use double quotes, i'm not arguing with your preference :)

2013-09-20 15:57:42	sukima	It struck me as odd because the statements prior to the haha wern't really funny and were more stating opinion. Which is why I was curious

2013-09-20 17:07:10	Leeol	That's a good idea actually
2013-09-20 17:07:41	Leeol	sukima: I just can't shake the feeling that this is premature optimization. You're assuming some other compiler is going to change the syntax of a function closure, but not a comment block.
2013-09-20 17:07:46	 *	sukima steps out for a meeting
2013-09-20 17:07:56	Leeol	alright, take it easy

2013-09-23 21:49:13	dp	what's the best method to determine what function called the current function?
2013-09-23 21:49:23	dp	basically, getting a stack trace
2013-09-23 21:49:41	caitp	console.trace? :p

2013-09-23 21:50:42	dp	hrm. so there's no way to know what function called my current function?
2013-09-23 21:51:13	dp	guess I'm gonna have to set an ugly global
2013-09-23 21:51:22	caitp	yeah basically
2013-09-23 21:51:26	caitp	for debugging you can use console.trace
2013-09-23 21:51:31	caitp	but not too much else
