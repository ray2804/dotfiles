# About
This is a simple plugin to save favorite files that are not part of a project.  It supports adding and removing favorites and open favorite files.

# Usage
All commands are accessible via the command palatte.

## Favorite Files: Open File
Command provides a quick list to select one of your favorite files to open.

## Favorite Files: Add File
Add the current opened file to your favorites.  An input panel will be opened so you can provide a unique name for your favorite file.

## Favorite Files: Remove File
Remove a favorite file form your list.

## Favorite Files: Toggle Per Project
Allows saving per project favorites. Per projets must be toggled on for each project you are in.  You can toggle back and forth between per project and global favorites.

There is no easy way to detect the current project name reliably without forcing refreshing of the "Auto Save Session.sublime_session" file.  This causes me to have to pop up a refresh view.
