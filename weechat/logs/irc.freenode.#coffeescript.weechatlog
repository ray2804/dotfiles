2013-08-31 02:04:03	melvinram	Hmm, thanks. I'll look into Promise. I ended up doing it through callbacks but I don't really like the code… though it does work well.
2013-08-31 02:04:18	deltab	I didn't know about the pipe method, but it looks like it's just what you need
2013-08-31 02:04:55	melvinram	I'm looking through it now

2013-08-31 02:22:26	Vitaliy_	hello
2013-08-31 02:23:10	Vitaliy_	I need a simple program which would watch/compile/minify coffeescript files
2013-08-31 02:23:38	Vitaliy_	it can be very simple something like:
2013-08-31 02:24:07	Vitaliy_	fancycoffee --compile --watch --minify coffee1.coffee coffee2.coffee
2013-08-31 02:24:12	Vitaliy_	any suggestions?

2013-08-31 02:36:13	deltab	Vitaliy_: coffee itself will do the watching and compiling parts of that
2013-08-31 02:36:49	deltab	but not the minifying; I don't have anything to recommend for that
2013-08-31 02:37:46	Vitaliy_	ahh right, yeah thats the feature that I mostly need
2013-08-31 02:39:20	Vitaliy_	ive been using yuicompressor but that's another step i need to do every time i make a change
2013-08-31 02:40:20	deltab	there are programs to handle that, but I don't know any in particular
2013-08-31 02:41:26	Vitaliy_	ok thank you

2013-08-31 15:16:55	deltab	etcetera: you mean `...`?
2013-08-31 15:17:58	ingsoc	used gwt, to avoid JS, decided bloated, JS seems not so bad in retrospect, but now found coffeescript.  what is it like for debugging, are there any step debuggers for it (IDE's ?) .  One  thing i do like about GWT is the component/class based UI components that are parts of DOM that are also linked (encapsulated) within java classes which are built up dynamically and then attached to the DOM where required.
2013-08-31 15:18:04	ingsoc	 e.g. you can create a "form" widget/component that knows how to create all of it's form fields/controls and also takes care of their event handlers as methods on itself.  I am fairly new to web development but it seems in raw JS people tend to just have bare functions or anonymous functions created as event handlers with no kind of encapsulation.  Do people use coffeescript to create components in the sense of gwt d
2013-08-31 15:18:58	ingsoc	sorry for the long post
2013-08-31 15:19:06	ingsoc	has anything been cut off ?
2013-08-31 15:19:20	deltab	ingsoc: yes, with source maps debuggers such as web inspector can map locations in the js back to coffeescript code, which they display
2013-08-31 15:19:32	deltab	"sense of gwt d"
2013-08-31 15:19:45	ingsoc	escribed above as it has a nicer/easier object definition syntax ?
2013-08-31 15:20:06	ingsoc	(easiedr than raw JS)
2013-08-31 15:20:27	ingsoc	also i seem to have learned a fair bit about JS just reading the examples on the coffeescript website
2013-08-31 15:20:28	ingsoc	:)
2013-08-31 15:20:44	ingsoc	(the JS equivalent)

2013-08-31 15:21:51	deltab	very likely: there are all sorts of component frameworks
2013-08-31 15:22:14	ingsoc	i like the look of kendoui

2013-08-31 15:23:51	ingsoc	but obv the components still  require static html (e.g. <ul>/<li> that  they use to build their menu/menu items) and also some config options and the event handlers

2013-08-31 15:24:59	ingsoc	I was thinking that I could create object components that then takes an array or object for the menu items then creates the html dom element and attaches to the DOM and then calls the kendoui stuff to initialise it
2013-08-31 15:25:28	ingsoc	so it is a single encapsulated component
2013-08-31 15:25:52	ingsoc	deltab: what frameworks you talking about ?
