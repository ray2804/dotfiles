2013-04-03 15:17:17	Mion	vesz: you can simply add the kernel directly to the boot table in the uefi, but having gummiboot is handy since it makes it easier to add boot paramters etc, specially at boottime, eg if you have to add nomodeset or whatever due to problems

2013-04-03 15:18:26	supersym	Anyone knows the answer to having multiple kernel boot arguments in GRUB2, depending on the kernel you run in /etc/default/grub or something like that? Because it generates the same for every kernel in mkinitcpio
2013-04-03 15:18:43	Mion	supersym: wut?
2013-04-03 15:18:51	Mion	supersym: grub2 has nothing to do with mkinitcpio

2013-04-03 15:19:14	Mion	bretzel: you can do it while X is running
2013-04-03 15:19:22	bretzel	Mion uh ... okay :-)
2013-04-03 15:19:23	supersym	ok so I generate the images with mkinitcpio and right after I generate my GRUB2 mkconfig

2013-04-03 15:42:01	JackWinter1	penguin42: systemd isn't coredumping.  it's a feature that when a program coredumps then systemd stuffs the coredump into the journal (something which i personally don't need at all).  it's probably a bug that the systemd-coredump process hangs around consuming system memory when it can't be dumped into the journal though
