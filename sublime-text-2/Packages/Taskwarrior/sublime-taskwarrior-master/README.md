# Sublime Taskwarrior

A plugin for Sublime Text 2 to view, modify and add tasks with [Taskwarrior](http://www.taskwarrior.org).

When viewing tasks, tasks are organized by project as well as a "View all tasks" item. Select a task to complete, modify, or delete it.

When modifying or adding a task, use the same Taskwarrior syntax as you would on the command line.

## Commands

`super+shift+a, super+shift+t` – Annotate last task from clipboard.
