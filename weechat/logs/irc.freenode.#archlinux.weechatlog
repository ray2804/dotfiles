2013-04-03 15:17:17	Mion	vesz: you can simply add the kernel directly to the boot table in the uefi, but having gummiboot is handy since it makes it easier to add boot paramters etc, specially at boottime, eg if you have to add nomodeset or whatever due to problems

2013-04-03 15:18:26	supersym	Anyone knows the answer to having multiple kernel boot arguments in GRUB2, depending on the kernel you run in /etc/default/grub or something like that? Because it generates the same for every kernel in mkinitcpio
2013-04-03 15:18:43	Mion	supersym: wut?
2013-04-03 15:18:51	Mion	supersym: grub2 has nothing to do with mkinitcpio

2013-04-03 15:19:14	Mion	bretzel: you can do it while X is running
2013-04-03 15:19:22	bretzel	Mion uh ... okay :-)
2013-04-03 15:19:23	supersym	ok so I generate the images with mkinitcpio and right after I generate my GRUB2 mkconfig

2013-04-03 15:42:01	JackWinter1	penguin42: systemd isn't coredumping.  it's a feature that when a program coredumps then systemd stuffs the coredump into the journal (something which i personally don't need at all).  it's probably a bug that the systemd-coredump process hangs around consuming system memory when it can't be dumped into the journal though

2013-04-24 01:18:03	djzn	demonicmaniac3, let me explain the issue: My IGP struggles to play Full HD movies (HD 3200). When I had the 6450, it was quite alright. Will the X1950 BE BETTER than the 3200 IGP itself ?
2013-04-24 01:18:04	dx	grawity: lol
2013-04-24 01:18:05	Earnestly	grawity: Sigh. I think I broke journalctl again (well, doing something dumb). I can't get it to display the entire line length anymore. Even with `--full -a'

2013-04-24 01:19:21	demonicmaniac3	djzn: what do you use for movie playback?
2013-04-24 01:19:30	demonicmaniac3	djzn: catalyst legacy or open source drivers?
2013-04-24 01:19:49	djzn	demonicmaniac3, I use OSS
2013-04-24 01:19:59	djzn	but I used catalyst and it was similar
2013-04-24 01:20:04	kylescottmcgill	djzn: Yeah i dont think you should be getting lag or anything, whats the actual problem? Frame drops? (sorry im chiming in half way through)
2013-04-24 01:20:17	demonicmaniac3	well for catalyst you need the vaapi thingie
2013-04-24 01:20:18	grawity	Earnestly: Like, at all, even if I don't add -a or --full
2013-04-24 01:20:22	djzn	framedrops on IGP, yes
2013-04-24 01:20:33	demonicmaniac3	djzn: have you tried mplayer -vo gl?
2013-04-24 01:20:34	Earnestly	grawity: It just cuts them off before getting too long so it doesn't mess up the pretty columns of timestamps. This is not a useful default. I'm curious why -a and --full don't work
2013-04-24 01:20:49	grawity	...like I said, it doesn't do that for me anymore
2013-04-24 01:20:50	demonicmaniac3	djzn: your igp shouldn't have any issues with that

2013-04-24 01:20:58	djzn	no, i haven't tried that, actually I will make some tests with that
2013-04-24 01:21:01	Earnestly	grawity: Could it be a difference in conf?
2013-04-24 01:21:12	djzn	the question is whether the X1950 will be better than IGP
2013-04-24 01:21:12	demonicmaniac3	xv was actually broken in catalyst for some time
2013-04-24 01:21:17	Earnestly	did you alias it or something?
2013-04-24 01:21:23	grawity	nope
2013-04-24 01:21:28	demonicmaniac3	djzn: yes but not warranting paying 50 for the little difference there is for video playback 
2013-04-24 01:21:42	demonicmaniac3	if the hd3200 does it ok with -vo gl 
2013-04-24 01:21:52	demonicmaniac3	actually the hd 3200 should be opengl 3.1 by now with mesa 9.2
2013-04-24 01:21:59	demonicmaniac3	so you can even try -vo gl3
2013-04-24 01:22:05	djzn	actually I find HD3200 slow with OSS and Catalyst in 2D
2013-04-24 01:22:21	Kirito	Any idea why pressing "end" in urxvt outputs a "p" and a newline?
2013-04-24 01:22:22	Testing567	Ok, I got GDM working somewhat, but it crashes X if I switch to a tty
2013-04-24 01:22:23	djzn	so that would improve with X1950?
2013-04-24 01:22:31	demonicmaniac3	you can always tweak the driver 
2013-04-24 01:22:34	Kirito	(End is the 1 on my numpad)
2013-04-24 01:22:34	Earnestly	grawity: Hm.
2013-04-24 01:22:39	demonicmaniac3	force a clock with dynpm, try glamour, all that jazz
2013-04-24 01:22:42	kylescottmcgill	djzn: according to the internets, that card would be faster, but honestly, i wouldnt invest in another card if you dont need to
2013-04-24 01:22:54	demonicmaniac3	djzn: yes it would be much better with the r500

2013-04-24 02:49:46	sagir3	djzn, not true. if you play 1080p on a computer without a dedicated graphics card, it will take up more than 60% of your processor; if you have a discrete graphics card, it will use around 20-25%
2013-04-24 02:50:09	kylescottmcgill	for me thats my issues, watching VLC sit at 90 ~ 105 % while im listening to AMV's or something is lame-o... but its not critical

2013-04-24 04:22:18	TheHairyWoodsman	I doublechecked with fstab—my UUID to my device has not changed, my /dev/md126p6 has not changed

2013-04-24 05:16:59	BonSequitur	So the i686 glib2 package still needs to be recompiled.
2013-04-24 05:17:26	BonSequitur	I guess I could do it myself but 1. it would probably take forever, 2. manually editing the config file and building my own version of glib2 sounds like a fantastic way of breaking my whole system.
2013-04-24 05:17:43	BonSequitur	So I guess I'm just downgrading to glib2 2.34 for now.

2013-04-24 08:53:07	simon	hemite, I think modern windows versions require a lot of memory, and if you add the size of games, you might end up using a significant part of your SSD. if you use a fixed amount of space (i.e. don't add a lot of new games), you could restrict it, but I can't tell you how much that'd need to be. I bet 20G isn't enough for windows 8 + random huge 3D game.

I tried to strace as root (root's theme is the default vbox theme) and the problem is still present.

2013-04-24 16:42:41	ciarlill	MrElendig: thanks but I have read that page a few times. trying to get some clarity on a few things mentioned there. 1) do I need to add radeon.modeset=1 to my kernel params to enable KMS for the radeon card or is it automatic? Same for i915? How do I make sure both drivers have/are using KMS?

2013-04-25 15:15:57	eto	arch iso dev you should seriously reconsider adding sshd enabled by default support
2013-04-25 15:16:14	MrElendig	b2coutts: or just buy a 10€ keyboard
2013-04-25 15:16:14	mSSM	Coz my question above got swamped: Any ideas why my tmux sessions get killed with exiting my systemd --user session? How can I fix this? The tmux sessions even get killed when I detach them first.
2013-04-25 15:16:25	MrElendig	or "loan" one form another box
2013-04-25 15:16:38	Earnestly	solsTiCe: Anyway, `while read line; do md5sum -c "$line"; done < file 
2013-04-25 15:16:44	b2coutts	yeah, I'm at my father's house and he apparently doesn't have a keyboard
2013-04-25 15:16:47	mSSM	MrElendig: Never buy a €10 keyboard. Brrrrrr. Waste of moneyz.
2013-04-25 15:16:52	b2coutts	and I'm armed only with my laptop and the arch DVD
2013-04-25 15:17:02	MrElendig	mSSM: nha, perfectly fine for once every 5 year work on a headless box
2013-04-25 15:17:18	mSSM	Still, the pain it causes.
2013-04-25 15:17:31	Earnestly	MrElendig: Conversely, buying a tenkeyless can be portable
2013-04-25 15:17:31	eto	b2coutts: no single keyboard in the house?
2013-04-25 15:17:40	b2coutts	eto: according to him
2013-04-25 15:17:44	b2coutts	he basically just uses a laptop

My current setup is Debian stable with backported kernel as an LXC host, then several Debian userland installations as LXC containers. I'm wondering if there are serious ...
2013-04-25 17:29:39	MacGyver	... issues with e.g. first setting up a few Arch LXC containers under the Debian LXC host (so with Debian kernel), or first switching the LXC host to arch and then one by one put the containers to arch as well.

2013-04-26 00:32:26	Artemis_	buhman: indeed it does not exist -- but: I'm very sure I booted uefi because I switched off "legacy" boot support in my thinkpad bios and the bootprocess (image/boot loader style) changed after that

2013-04-26 00:34:03	Apsu`	Neat. bash-completion got moved into util-linux, I guess.
