2012-12-22 17:11:34	supersymmetry	say balupton, if i were to try and write a plugin for docpad
2012-12-22 17:11:45	supersymmetry	what would be something to be desired atm?
2012-12-22 17:20:54	supersymmetry	personally I'd still like to see a good node app, preferbly docpad ^^ which employs rendering of markdown files from dropbox
2012-12-22 17:21:38	supersymmetry	shame is it would break the static generator 'tradition' since I think you'd have to employ that with something like express
2012-12-22 17:23:24	supersymmetry	also Im still thinking about hacking up some plugin to automatically replace stylesheet url(images) to inline base64, for a increased speedboost i seem fixated with :P

2012-12-22 17:47:17	supersymmetry	hey wolf
2012-12-22 17:51:46	urlwolf	hey supersymmetry
2012-12-22 17:51:58	urlwolf	did you get done with that deadline?
2012-12-22 17:53:28	supersymmetry	yep ^^
2012-12-22 17:53:35	supersymmetry	first very happy customer :)
2012-12-22 17:54:16	supersymmetry	now i got some spare time to work on some productivity enhancements and sharpen my l33t skillz :P
2012-12-22 17:54:31	supersymmetry	thanks for asking
2012-12-22 17:55:18	urlwolf	cool
2012-12-22 17:55:24	urlwolf	is that your first customer?
2012-12-22 17:55:26	urlwolf	nice!
2012-12-22 17:55:47	urlwolf	I'm about to start consulting, too; this is what my docpad site is about
2012-12-22 17:56:52	supersymmetry	well my first real since long... i did some hobby webdevelopment on game sites a few years back
2012-12-22 17:57:14	supersymmetry	but then i became an air force officer so a lot of time spent on doing military stuff :P
2012-12-22 17:57:29	supersymmetry	but recently I told them to shuv it and went to work for myself :)
2012-12-22 17:57:36	urlwolf	wow
2012-12-22 17:57:47	supersymmetry	consulting erh? that sounds like fun :)
2012-12-22 17:57:52	urlwolf	did you get to pilot a jet?
2012-12-22 17:58:20	supersymmetry	I guess im not the type for that yet... rather much of the autistic programmer atm Im afraid :O
2012-12-22 17:59:05	supersymmetry	no i was commander of a specialized security force, then i was drill/course officer and i was staff officer for air operations in sudan
2012-12-22 17:59:50	supersymmetry	is your site finished already or?
2012-12-22 18:01:01	supersymmetry	and how will it facilitate you in your consultancy or is it more like a showcase
2012-12-22 18:01:19	urlwolf	I'm on it
2012-12-22 18:01:32	urlwolf	being on it for too long :) I want to ship it
2012-12-22 18:01:35	supersymmetry	haha
2012-12-22 18:01:37	supersymmetry	yeah
2012-12-22 18:01:47	urlwolf	I can push it to github if you want to see it;
2012-12-22 18:01:54	supersymmetry	my problem is, I have 1000 ideas of stuff thats not done or poorly
2012-12-22 18:02:03	urlwolf	I know
2012-12-22 18:02:05	supersymmetry	so I always lack time :P
2012-12-22 18:02:08	urlwolf	focusing is ... hard
2012-12-22 18:02:18	supersymmetry	GF is getting a bit pissed off now and then ><
2012-12-22 18:02:28	supersymmetry	yeah
2012-12-22 18:02:46	urlwolf	so should I push?
2012-12-22 18:02:51	supersymmetry	I'd be intrested
2012-12-22 18:03:21	supersymmetry	tredius.bitbucket.org is where the dev branch of mine is now
2012-12-22 18:03:35	supersymmetry	source isnt in a public repo tho i think
2012-12-22 18:04:27	urlwolf	https://github.com/quesada/josequesada.docpad
2012-12-22 18:05:54	urlwolf	I started preparing for heroku, and now I get some 'SyntaxError: unmatched OUTDENT on line 36  ' when doing docpad run. Not sure what changed. Maybe npm update?
2012-12-22 18:06:04	urlwolf	let's see if you get it or not
2012-12-22 18:06:30	supersymmetry	erh no i dont think so
2012-12-22 18:06:42	supersymmetry	just like it says :P outdent where it isnt supposed to be
2012-12-22 18:06:59	urlwolf	damn; I'm no good with coffee
2012-12-22 18:07:24	supersymmetry	# Specify some site properties
2012-12-22 18:07:24	supersymmetry	  site:
2012-12-22 18:07:24	supersymmetry	            title: "J
2012-12-22 18:07:25	urlwolf	I suspect it's a silly caracter mistyped when I thought I was in a browser window. I have autosave :)
2012-12-22 18:07:30	supersymmetry	i think its that one
2012-12-22 18:07:33	urlwolf	ah
2012-12-22 18:07:35	supersymmetry	atleast its indent is off
2012-12-22 18:07:39	supersymmetry	damn that was fast
2012-12-22 18:08:15	urlwolf	which file?
2012-12-22 18:08:20	supersymmetry	docpad.coffee
2012-12-22 18:08:53	supersymmetry	strange it doesnt match anywhere near the line you mentioned
2012-12-22 18:09:06	supersymmetry	sometimes thats the case but maybe there are more :P
2012-12-22 18:09:40	supersymmetry	I used Jade mostly for mine, and coffeekup for the code-heavy parts / cson for config
2012-12-22 18:09:58	supersymmetry	I have a big fetish for elegant/cleaness in code and solutions
2012-12-22 18:10:07	supersymmetry	thats why I don't see myself using eco anytime soon
2012-12-22 18:10:18	urlwolf	hehe
2012-12-22 18:10:20	supersymmetry	it feels like a step backwards with all the brackets ><
2012-12-22 18:10:30	supersymmetry	but I can see why it would work for many people
2012-12-22 18:10:33	urlwolf	I wanted to ship fast, learn the bare minimum. 
2012-12-22 18:10:39	supersymmetry	and you can do a great deal of copy-paste :)
2012-12-22 18:10:43	supersymmetry	yep
2012-12-22 18:10:45	supersymmetry	smart move
2012-12-22 18:11:18	supersymmetry	i feel that was a right decision of balupton et.al. to have it (eco) be predominant in the examples as well
2012-12-22 18:11:29	urlwolf	familiarity
2012-12-22 18:11:41	supersymmetry	as it will definitly decrease the amount of people that run away scared
2012-12-22 18:11:44	supersymmetry	yeah
2012-12-22 18:11:46	urlwolf	did you host onn bitbuket?
2012-12-22 18:12:15	supersymmetry	only during development, it's on a plesk server the customer already had but im gonna move it away there... it blows donkeyballs
2012-12-22 18:12:16	urlwolf	have you tried heroku?
2012-12-22 18:12:44	supersymmetry	well yes but this site is now 100% static and I wanted to do a bit more with that part in the sense of cookieless domains etc
2012-12-22 18:12:56	supersymmetry	some stuff i dont think heroku is very suitable for
2012-12-22 18:13:15	supersymmetry	but ill prolly move some parts to dynamic anyway
2012-12-22 18:13:28	supersymmetry	i wanna have the customer write the content in markdown to dropbox and render from therew
2012-12-22 18:13:54	supersymmetry	a bit like http://dillinger.io/
2012-12-22 18:14:06	supersymmetry	and http://scriptogr.am
2012-12-22 18:14:51	urlwolf	heroku seems to fail building docpad-plugin-robotskirt
2012-12-22 18:15:11	urlwolf	npm ERR! robotskirt@2.6.1 install: `node-waf clean ; node-waf configure build`
2012-12-22 18:15:26	urlwolf	when doing push heroku master
2012-12-22 18:16:48	urlwolf	cool idea, re: dillinger/ scriptogr.am
2012-12-22 18:17:03	supersymmetry	yep
2012-12-22 18:17:05	supersymmetry	ur right
2012-12-22 18:17:22	urlwolf	I've never used heroku
2012-12-22 18:17:26	urlwolf	seems hard to debug
2012-12-22 18:17:29	supersymmetry	i wonder if they try it with python3
2012-12-22 18:17:43	urlwolf	maybe it doesn't let you compile node extensions
2012-12-22 18:17:53	supersymmetry	im on arch, had a few issues before i realized i had to hijack `python` command back to 2.7
2012-12-22 18:18:02	urlwolf	hehe
2012-12-22 18:18:16	supersymmetry	what are node extensions?
2012-12-22 18:18:24	urlwolf	I was on sabayon for years; now on ubuntu; not so bad
2012-12-22 18:18:28	urlwolf	well modules
2012-12-22 18:18:36	supersymmetry	right is that the only part being compiled i guess
2012-12-22 18:18:48	urlwolf	let me try marked instead
2012-12-22 18:19:07	supersymmetry	yeah debian is cool... just at a certain point i found it to obfuscate too much of the inner workings of linux
2012-12-22 18:19:13	supersymmetry	all the handy wrappers became a nuisance
2012-12-22 18:19:24	supersymmetry	less = better :P
2012-12-22 18:24:32	urlwolf	I like arch
2012-12-22 18:27:30	supersymmetry	yeah I really became fond of it as well... I havent been on Linux for long, about a year now of which half on debian, but I learn really fast :)
2012-12-22 18:27:42	supersymmetry	and arch is just very much to my likings I found
2012-12-22 18:27:52	supersymmetry	plus great wiki
2012-12-22 18:27:56	urlwolf	maybe livereload won't work on heroku
2012-12-22 18:28:09	supersymmetry	erh... no i guess it wouldnt be of much use
2012-12-22 18:28:13	urlwolf	and great forums
2012-12-22 18:28:17	supersymmetry	and prolly IO is crossing some boundries
2012-12-22 18:28:51	supersymmetry	you shouldnt really need anything besides server and maybe cleanurls?
2012-12-22 18:28:59	urlwolf	using awesomewm is what keeps linux on top for desktop use
2012-12-22 18:29:12	supersymmetry	because its already compiled at build time right
2012-12-22 18:31:11	urlwolf	marked works
2012-12-22 18:31:34	urlwolf	http://fast-journey-9344.herokuapp.com/
2012-12-22 18:32:05	supersymmetry	cool!!
2012-12-22 18:32:20	urlwolf	btw, any feedback on content etc is welcome
2012-12-22 18:32:33	urlwolf	There's nothing on the blog, really
2012-12-22 18:32:47	urlwolf	http://fast-journey-9344.herokuapp.com/problems-and-solutions.html
2012-12-22 18:32:53	urlwolf	the use of accordions here
2012-12-22 18:33:00	urlwolf	is to know what problems people care about
2012-12-22 18:33:08	urlwolf	I'll register clicks
2012-12-22 18:33:26	supersymmetry	your field happens to be something I always had great intrest in
2012-12-22 18:33:43	supersymmetry	i almost went to study cognitive AI on uni
2012-12-22 18:34:06	supersymmetry	and somehow i keep getting back at semantics and reasoning/web based learning
2012-12-22 18:34:18	supersymmetry	guess cause both my parents are language teachers ;)
2012-12-22 18:34:28	supersymmetry	very cool
2012-12-22 18:34:29	urlwolf	you have great guys in Netherlands
2012-12-22 18:34:35	urlwolf	Frank v hamerlen
2012-12-22 18:35:10	urlwolf	site is responsive btw
2012-12-22 18:35:20	supersymmetry	i like him already
2012-12-22 18:35:37	supersymmetry	If you are any good, you know you could be better
2012-12-22 18:35:40	supersymmetry	haha
2012-12-22 18:35:42	supersymmetry	so true
2012-12-22 18:36:06	urlwolf	damn, disqus doesn't show
2012-12-22 18:37:20	urlwolf	nor related posts
2012-12-22 18:37:56	supersymmetry	i spent some time in protege a few days back
2012-12-22 18:38:02	supersymmetry	again
2012-12-22 18:38:54	supersymmetry	rather complex subjects though... seems they even have a hard time doing real computational power with still rather simple models
2012-12-22 18:39:14	urlwolf	yeah
2012-12-22 18:39:19	supersymmetry	math is a bit hard for me but basics I get ... and since I studied classification sciences
2012-12-22 18:39:34	supersymmetry	I became very intrested in ontology of soft and malware
2012-12-22 18:39:55	urlwolf	I'm trying to transition out of semantics and more into 'database marketing'
2012-12-22 18:40:14	urlwolf	which is just predictive models of what people will buy, when, how much...
2012-12-22 18:40:24	urlwolf	just hoping this has a better market
2012-12-22 18:41:33	urlwolf	is this too 'over the top'?
2012-12-22 18:41:34	urlwolf	http://fast-journey-9344.herokuapp.com/why-you-should-work-with-me.html
2012-12-22 18:41:48	urlwolf	(again accordions, but it doesn't seem to work as I see now)
2012-12-22 18:42:08	urlwolf	it's written for the american mindset, where you have to tout your own horn
2012-12-22 18:54:32	urlwolf	ugh
2012-12-22 18:54:46	urlwolf	g's page speed score: 62 only (!)
2012-12-22 18:54:57	urlwolf	lots of work left
2012-12-22 18:55:00	urlwolf	a bit dissapointed
2012-12-22 18:55:50	urlwolf	I wonder if docpad does have a plugin for js / css compression
2012-12-22 18:58:10	supersymmetry	says 404
2012-12-22 18:58:21	supersymmetry	sorry was doing the dishes
2012-12-22 18:58:37	supersymmetry	yes uglify
2012-12-22 18:58:47	supersymmetry	let me look real quick ;)
2012-12-22 19:00:19	supersymmetry	yeah i see
2012-12-22 19:00:37	supersymmetry	you need to concat as much css as you can into 1, maybe 2 files
2012-12-22 19:01:04	supersymmetry	also the order matters for optimal http parallel downloads
2012-12-22 19:01:10	supersymmetry	move css before js
2012-12-22 19:01:57	supersymmetry	but, and this is why heroku isnt necessarily good for these pages, you need to tweak your static http server
2012-12-22 19:02:09	supersymmetry	set caching lifetime on your assets
2012-12-22 19:02:37	supersymmetry	whats all the socket.io doing btw 
2012-12-22 19:03:15	supersymmetry	also dead links are killing for your speed
2012-12-22 19:03:48	supersymmetry	any src thats not there, images or scripts and what not will take up much time if they are 404
2012-12-22 19:04:20	urlwolf	The page Benjamin Lupton got an overall PageSpeed Score of 65
2012-12-22 19:04:25	urlwolf	he's on heroku too
2012-12-22 19:04:27	supersymmetry	actually that and HTTP GET requests are the major factors anyone should worry about because they have such a great factor
2012-12-22 19:04:35	supersymmetry	haha
2012-12-22 19:04:41	urlwolf	HTTP GETs, I think so too
2012-12-22 19:04:48	supersymmetry	i never said his was optimal either ;)
2012-12-22 19:04:57	urlwolf	socket.io is only used for livereload
2012-12-22 19:05:05	supersymmetry	but anyway for a few html pages its still neglectable in many cases
2012-12-22 19:05:06	urlwolf	should work on dev mode only
2012-12-22 19:05:14	supersymmetry	i just nitpick about these things
2012-12-22 19:05:28	supersymmetry	did you do docpad render --static?
2012-12-22 19:05:31	urlwolf	my wp sites are all faster than this
2012-12-22 19:05:33	urlwolf	nop
2012-12-22 19:05:36	supersymmetry	generate i mean
2012-12-22 19:05:36	supersymmetry	do so
2012-12-22 19:05:44	supersymmetry	it makes the site production ready
2012-12-22 19:05:48	urlwolf	I followed the steps in the guide
2012-12-22 19:06:00	urlwolf	http://bevry.me/learn/docpad-deploy
2012-12-22 19:06:10	supersymmetry	also I suggest you take a little look at perhaps Grunt or Ender if you find yourself stuck with many css/js
2012-12-22 19:06:23	supersymmetry	and you want good tools to deal with that
2012-12-22 19:06:24	urlwolf	yep
2012-12-22 19:06:32	urlwolf	I like brunch
2012-12-22 19:06:42	urlwolf	but it does a bit too much on top of docpad
2012-12-22 19:06:43	supersymmetry	yeah i looked into that a while ago as well :)
2012-12-22 19:06:50	supersymmetry	*nods*
2012-12-22 19:07:09	urlwolf	the guide says nothing about docpad render --static
2012-12-22 19:07:11	supersymmetry	i partially succeeded in deploying AMD with my site.....damn damn
2012-12-22 19:07:25	supersymmetry	from 600ms to 10ms in some cases ><
2012-12-22 19:07:28	supersymmetry	100
2012-12-22 19:07:30	supersymmetry	sick
2012-12-22 19:07:42	supersymmetry	that was overkill too tho
2012-12-22 19:11:13	urlwolf	did you use require.js for amd?
2012-12-22 19:11:48	supersymmetry	yeah
2012-12-22 19:11:50	supersymmetry	jam
2012-12-22 19:11:57	supersymmetry	very awesome tool
2012-12-22 19:12:12	urlwolf	ok, I think I have some more pressing things to worry about now :)
2012-12-22 19:12:29	supersymmetry	true and thats the same thing i realized after half a day
2012-12-22 19:12:38	supersymmetry	anyway it was a nuke to kill fly
2012-12-22 19:12:39	urlwolf	hehe
2012-12-22 19:12:45	urlwolf	story of my life
2012-12-22 19:12:46	supersymmetry	because my jquery namespace was messed up
2012-12-22 19:12:55	supersymmetry	:)
2012-12-22 19:13:14	urlwolf	do you have any idea why disqus doesn't show?
2012-12-22 19:13:19	supersymmetry	what did donald knut or so say? premature optimization is the root of all evil
2012-12-22 19:13:27	supersymmetry	no i never tried that
2012-12-22 19:13:38	urlwolf	but being slower that wp sites is scary :)
2012-12-22 19:15:16	supersymmetry	lol
2012-12-22 19:15:35	supersymmetry	imma go finish writing my plugin
2012-12-22 19:15:52	supersymmetry	its gonna replace all suitable inline url() of css to base64 encoding
2012-12-22 19:16:01	supersymmetry	= 10-20 or so http calls less ;)
2012-12-22 19:16:24	supersymmetry	only those vimeo fuckers keep sending garbage my way
2012-12-22 19:16:33	supersymmetry	XSS/mashup really blows
2012-12-22 19:17:03	supersymmetry	the info is fun, but the amount of risk and tracking cookies is just insane
2012-12-22 19:20:14	urlwolf	maybe disqus wants to have the real domain I gave them :)
2012-12-22 19:21:15	urlwolf	cookies: use ghostery addon
2012-12-22 19:21:24	urlwolf	and better-privacy (FF only)
2012-12-22 19:25:52	urlwolf	heh, fixed disqus
2012-12-22 19:26:15	urlwolf	getting the fonts from google's cdn should help too
2012-12-22 19:28:07	supersymmetry	yeah i also use ghostry

2012-12-27 20:03:29	supersym	balupton__ I need to trigger some code if a HTML element value changed also during LiveReload, I have it do a HTTP request to get a diagram based on text inside a textarea, so I dont want to do that everytime someone with livereload on saves their document, it rerenders the image (=http post, updating the image field) so I need to say like check it for being "dirty" ... what would be a good solution? Do I

2012-12-28 13:59:42	supersym	balupton__, yes and no.. I found some really great solutions, got abstracted away a bit too much into clojure eventually lol, but found some great solutions to make stuff I want even easier, so I'll pick that up later
2012-12-28 14:00:24	supersym	I guess it boils down, with diagrams anyway, to either have it do http calls to a server externally and be dependent on the line/machine, and/or include a .jar and run it
2012-12-28 14:02:25	supersym	no pure javascript implementation, the node placement algorithm of graphviz is extremely good but written in C, now plantuml rewritten it and 1 or 2 people made some really fun apps with it best of all http://renderist.herokuapp.com/
2012-12-28 14:02:55	supersym	im now thinking what would be a greatly flexible way of incorporating that idea with dp-plug-gist
2012-12-28 14:02:55	frederic	was wondering if it was possible to write a meta-data property value over multiple lines - for instance say I want to write **tags: ['tag1', 'tag2', ......., 'tag20']** on multiple lines... it doesn't seem to work
2012-12-28 14:03:44	supersym	doesnt backslash work?

2012-12-28 14:18:22	supersym	the proper way to do multiline what you want is

2012-12-28 14:25:57	supersym	it misses out on the coffee files and serves you .js so you'll have a lot harder time trying to read and understand
2012-12-28 14:27:01	frederic	This is working
2012-12-28 14:27:10	supersym	good :)
2012-12-28 14:27:12	frederic	qt:
2012-12-28 14:27:49	frederic	\tab - {image: 'myimage', desc: 'desc'}
2012-12-28 14:28:16	frederic	\tab - {image: 'otherimage', desc: 'other desc'}
2012-12-28 14:29:06	frederic	this is similar to qt: [ {image: 'myimage', desc: 'desc'}, {image: 'otherimage', desc: 'other desc'} ]
2012-12-28 14:29:30	frederic	thanks a lot 'supersym'

2012-12-28 14:33:40	frederic	docpad seems to have several markdown engines ... any recommendation ?
2012-12-28 14:37:49	supersym	use marked
2012-12-28 14:37:56	supersym	its default now i think
2012-12-28 14:38:53	frederic	How to get markdown parsed content in a layout? <%- @document.content %> will return unparsed markdown content
2012-12-28 14:40:10	supersym	or use robotskirt if you want the sundown utils
2012-12-28 14:40:40	supersym	you should really take a close look at the skeletons docpad provides
2012-12-28 14:41:01	supersym	e.g. kitchensink uses a lot of different examples
2012-12-28 14:41:26	frederic	I did but those are quite simplistic examples ...
2012-12-28 14:42:15	frederic	I'm trying to figure if I can come up with a corporate web site out of docpad
2012-12-28 14:42:18	supersym	i dont really use eco so i'll have to check too :)
2012-12-28 14:42:22	balupton	federic: you can also use CSON - https://github.com/bevry/cson - as the meta data language by doing "``` cson" as the header instead of just "```"
2012-12-28 14:43:26	supersym	use .html.md
2012-12-28 14:44:35	frederic	balupton: the yaml approach with each item on a separate line is fine ... I was just not able to find out how to do it ...
2012-12-28 14:45:13	balupton	yeah :)
2012-12-28 14:45:22	supersym	that will first render the markdown to html, which is how .html.jade and .html.eco all work by naming convention in docpad
2012-12-28 14:47:27	frederic	supersym: supersym: not sure to get it ...
2012-12-28 14:47:47	supersym	the file names
2012-12-28 14:47:57	frederic	the instruction in a layout: feature-set.html.eco
2012-12-28 14:48:20	supersym	yeah so have src/documents/index.html.md
2012-12-28 14:48:36	supersym	and have the index point to -> layout: feature-set
2012-12-28 14:48:56	supersym	with @document.content will do the trick
2012-12-28 14:49:18	supersym	that is in eco/coffeekup, jade doesn't use the @ to denote 'this'
2012-12-28 14:49:35	frederic	wait ... wait ... wait ... I think I just messed up...

2012-12-28 14:51:34	zenorocha	hey guys
2012-12-28 14:51:39	zenorocha	How can I minify HTML, CSS and JavaScript files and also concat CSS and JavaScript files when I hit docpad generate? 
2012-12-28 14:51:39	supersym	hiya
2012-12-28 14:51:42	zenorocha	https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/docpad/QnS9CqN_QYQ
2012-12-28 14:53:25	supersym	you don't
2012-12-28 14:53:47	supersym	concat of JS requires additional knowledge about the order in which stuff appears
2012-12-28 14:54:17	supersym	you use browserify, ender, AMD modules, jam and what not for this purpose
2012-12-28 14:54:31	supersym	so you dont mess up global namespaces in js
2012-12-28 14:54:45	supersym	for most other stuff like minify docpad-plugin-uglify
2012-12-28 14:55:18	zenorocha	oh the forum was abandoned
2012-12-28 14:55:25	zenorocha	so I moved my question to stackoverflow
2012-12-28 14:55:25	zenorocha	http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14070580/how-can-i-minify-html-css-and-javascript-files-in-docpad
2012-12-28 14:55:41	zenorocha	i'll take a look at docpad-plugin-uglify
2012-12-28 14:56:32	frederic	ok ... I got it - it was just that my document was still html.eco from an initial trial... I now got the parsed content by using @content --- @document.content will give unparsed content (not sure why)
2012-12-28 14:57:02	supersym	oh ofc
2012-12-28 14:57:03	zenorocha	hmm...
2012-12-28 14:57:10	zenorocha	but docpad-plugin-uglify doesn't minify html and css, just js
2012-12-28 14:57:15	supersym	correct, my bad... it hold a reference of it's own source code
2012-12-28 14:57:27	supersym	the backbone object that is
2012-12-28 14:57:45	supersym	html prolly gets minified
2012-12-28 14:57:54	supersym	check the real source using a plain editor
2012-12-28 14:58:02	supersym	in out/ directory
2012-12-28 14:58:14	supersym	cause I had to hack the jade plugin to not minify my source output
2012-12-28 14:59:26	frederic	in the same layout file, I grab other marked down documents **<% for item in @getCollection('html').findAll({tags: {$has: ['feature']}, featureSet: @document.featureSet}, [order:1]).toJSON(): %>**   and this time I'm using **<%- item.contentRendered %>** to get parsed content ...
2012-12-28 14:59:52	frederic	Is this the proper approach?
2012-12-28 15:00:02	supersym	zenorocha> ok it doesnt with eco so it seems
2012-12-28 15:00:14	supersym	there is probably a configuration item somewhere that can dis/enable that
2012-12-28 15:00:45	balupton	zenorocha: https://gist.github.com/4398093
2012-12-28 15:01:22	supersym	frederic: balupton can answer that, I still don't really get QueryEngine
2012-12-28 15:01:26	balupton	I've used that in one project, works well - for minification I use cloudflare so happens post-deployment automatically
2012-12-28 15:02:23	zenorocha	balupton: thanks
2012-12-28 15:02:26	balupton	frederic: yeah, that'll work well - you can probably move the @getCollection('html').findAll({tags: {$has: ['feature']} - portion out into a collection inside your docpad configuration file to speed things up a bit
2012-12-28 15:02:31	zenorocha	i'll take a look on that
2012-12-28 15:02:54	balupton	then do something like @getcollection('features').findAll(… - inside your templates instead
2012-12-28 15:03:05	zenorocha	balupton: there's a solution for html/css minify?
2012-12-28 15:06:56	balupton	cloudflare
2012-12-28 15:07:02	balupton	http://blog.cloudflare.com/an-all-new-and-improved-autominify
2012-12-28 15:07:06	balupton	;)
2012-12-28 15:07:27	balupton	but I mean, you could do the same approach to minify too
2012-12-28 15:07:41	balupton	same approach as in firing an executable like we do with browserify
2012-12-28 15:08:05	balupton	for instance, this is us firing grunt - https://gist.github.com/3898915
2012-12-28 15:09:10	frederic	thanks for the help guys .. will go ahead with my proof of concept ... :)
2012-12-28 15:09:18	supersym	sweet :)
2012-12-28 15:09:28	supersym	ive been using grunt too
2012-12-28 15:09:35	supersym	grunt-modernizr pwns
2012-12-28 15:11:46	supersym	i think im gonna improve on the dp-plug-gist 
2012-12-28 15:12:03	supersym	this current strategy doesnt really work

2012-12-28 15:20:28	zenorocha	great! grunt seems like a good idea for that
2012-12-28 15:22:47	supersym	hmm github api over uri doesnt really cut it... 
2012-12-28 15:24:51	supersym	oh ok...we have callbacks as JSONP

2012-12-28 15:37:50	supersym	the hardest thing about development now, has become deciding on features...
2012-12-28 15:38:40	supersym	probably gonna go for a twofold approach of being able to set document meta-data as github user/pass as well as globally in docpad.config file

2012-12-28 15:39:34	supersym	which allows you to create a gist (if you dont already have one) from inside the document source once and else just show the gist
2012-12-28 15:40:12	supersym	this allows me to create and use a gist, then perhaps render its content back to a actual local file
2012-12-28 15:40:31	supersym	the more I think about it, this would abstract to a docpad-remote kind of structure
2012-12-28 15:40:41	balupton	thats an interesting idea
2012-12-28 15:40:43	supersym	ofc you are limited by file size and amount
2012-12-28 15:40:47	supersym	like gists are
2012-12-28 15:41:53	supersym	but in theory you can really do some cool rendering from 1 docpad file and have a lot of automation on the fly

2012-12-28 15:42:03	supersym	using gists
2012-12-28 15:42:19	supersym	i was earlier wanting to do this with dropbox like scriptogr.am
2012-12-28 15:42:54	supersym	shame gists dont have something http://dillinger.io/ or you could really kick it up a notch
2012-12-28 15:43:22	supersym	http://autotelicum.github.com/Smooth-CoffeeScript/interactive/interactive-coffeescript.html
2012-12-28 15:43:39	supersym	if also a really really cool inline code/editor/renderer
2012-12-28 15:50:09	balupton	supersym: scriptogram is certainly interesting, it makes me think we should have a dropbox importer for content
2012-12-28 15:50:28	balupton	so I could edit files on my dropbox, and the remote server automaticaly updates
2012-12-28 15:50:33	balupton	without having to do any deployments
2012-12-28 15:50:47	supersym	yep
2012-12-28 15:51:01	balupton	hrmm… that is how we could do a SaaS solution and actually earn some money
2012-12-28 15:51:03	supersym	i really liked that part... i liked less that I had to use a gui
2012-12-28 15:51:07	balupton	haha
2012-12-28 15:51:17	supersym	with docpad I just use vim or sublime and have livereload
2012-12-28 15:51:20	supersym	plus alllll the extras
2012-12-28 15:51:40	supersym	but the dropbox api is fully js now i think
2012-12-28 15:51:55	balupton	as doing a SaaS has always been a roadmap for docpad, but we've hit issue after issue after issue with the implementation - turns out servers aren't made for content mangements that rely of the file system
2012-12-28 15:52:00	balupton	but using dropbox would solve those issues
2012-12-28 15:52:05	balupton	while still keeping use of the file system
2012-12-28 15:52:07	supersym	i just really didnt have time to explore to the full extent oauto and dropbox api but its all quite simple
2012-12-28 15:52:23	supersym	exactly
2012-12-28 15:52:36	supersym	you have file manager in any platform more or less in its OS GUI
2012-12-28 15:52:46	balupton	exactly
2012-12-28 15:52:46	supersym	because dropbox already wrote those
2012-12-28 15:53:06	balupton	alrighty, that'll be my immediate focus after the docpad website is up
2012-12-28 15:53:12	balupton	docpad website will be up within the next week
2012-12-28 15:53:26	balupton	current preview is here - http://docpad-website.herokuapp.com/
2012-12-28 15:53:52	balupton	ashnur: what do you think of the idea of using dropbox? do you think that could be an alternative to the wordpress importer?
2012-12-28 15:54:20	supersym	:D
2012-12-28 15:55:03	supersym	also in terms of storage, either dropbox - or google drive, or skydrive (7Gig!)
2012-12-28 15:55:21	supersym	are really all nice and trustable to remain in service for many years to come
2012-12-28 15:55:36	supersym	so it's rather safe
2012-12-28 15:56:16	supersym	i guess the choice for one (or more?) would depend on the relative ease you can manipulate then (hooking and authorizing on the API) and the features their API has
2012-12-28 15:56:27	supersym	for primarily anon users also I guess
2012-12-28 15:56:34	supersym	thats nice about gists
2012-12-28 15:56:39	supersym	you can make them without auth
2012-12-28 15:56:55	supersym	in dropbox you would (auto) share a folder and content
2012-12-28 15:58:30	supersym	but atm i dont have enough insight in that of google (anymore) or skydrive... i guess i can look into it a bit more ;)
2012-12-28 15:59:21	supersym	right now, for joe average, not knowing 1 bit beyond plain HTML made in Dreamweaver
2012-12-28 15:59:32	supersym	I think PaaS will still be a little bit out of their league
2012-12-28 15:59:45	supersym	we underestimate how many people do copy/paste
2012-12-28 16:00:11	supersym	and while though it would take away some degree of 'advanced knowledge' about docpad itself
2012-12-28 16:00:52	supersym	you'd make hosting and editing online stuff (the website source) a tad easier for those who don't know how to ssh over the cli to any of the PaaS
2012-12-28 16:01:28	supersym	so if you really want native OS file explorer integretion, Dropbox prolly has the best coverage
2012-12-28 16:01:35	supersym	on mobile and desktop devices
2012-12-28 16:01:54	supersym	with Windows, mac and nix
2012-12-28 16:03:09	supersym	if you dont want people to hate you, don't go with skydrive because MS always puts us up with crap stuff like not following certain standards when everyone else does
2012-12-28 16:03:38	supersym	but in terms of sustainability of the company, Google is bound to outlive, or absorb, something like Dropbox
2012-12-28 16:04:15	supersym	anyway I dont see dropbox fading away soon and this is the stuff you cant really predict :P
2012-12-28 16:04:33	balupton	yeah, well ultimately we'll have importers for everything
2012-12-28 16:04:49	balupton	rss, atom, wordpress, tumblr, gists, dropbox, google drive, ftp, etc.
2012-12-28 16:05:04	supersym	its all quite safe though and once done properly you'll have to maintain minor pieces since APIs dont change much luckily
2012-12-28 16:05:07	supersym	yeah ?:)
2012-12-28 16:05:10	balupton	when we start getting importers up, docpad will expload quickly, especially with the SaaS offerings
2012-12-28 16:05:12	supersym	I could see that ;)
2012-12-28 16:05:31	supersym	I know... there is a reason I sticked around... and seen much software in my life
2012-12-28 16:05:39	balupton	want me to create a repo for the plugin that we can work on
2012-12-28 16:05:45	supersym	this something I can envision as well
2012-12-28 16:05:56	supersym	cool
2012-12-28 16:08:32	balupton	is livereload failing to install for anyone else?
2012-12-28 16:10:14	supersym	i had some hangs on a few stuff but just as well might be my OS

2012-12-28 16:55:58	supersym	docpad is making me a very happy camper
2012-12-28 16:57:10	supersym	how do they say that? i can have my cake and eat it too
2012-12-28 16:57:17	supersym	:P
2012-12-28 16:59:23	supersym	i guess for those API/interface/service to be bundled the best approach is what docpad has in terms of clustering logical pieces of docpad cod
2012-12-28 16:59:25	supersym	*code
2012-12-28 17:00:13	supersym	the only drawback is that later we'll have so many docpad-plugins-something that it dominates say a npmjs, or github repo
2012-12-28 17:00:44	supersym	in the beginning you want enough, like now, to be noticed by ppl like me who doing a npm search
2012-12-28 17:01:57	supersym	npmsearch will do better even if enough people use and reference/depend on it... docpad as a standalone program, installed remotely with a server, hooking up to anything that is good and what ppl use on the web, as language and what not
2012-12-28 17:02:21	supersym	in that regard, combined with a Ace/Commandline environment like say Koding is king
2012-12-28 17:02:47	supersym	its awesome strength is flexibility and not imposing any flavour on the user
2012-12-28 17:03:09	supersym	being extendable, with many plugins as simple and powerful as possible
2012-12-28 17:03:50	supersym	the only drawback, there is always one, is that you would need with this current pace, cluster some parts
2012-12-28 17:03:59	supersym	like did with docpad-extras
2012-12-28 17:04:14	supersym	one thing i was thinking about when reading about oauth
2012-12-28 17:04:35	supersym	for example, we don't really have somewhere to cluster 'protocols' like oauth do we?
2012-12-28 17:05:07	supersym	(atm btw I always look for MIT and as much js based implementations of cool stuff, better coffee but it's just too yound to be widespread)
2012-12-28 17:05:41	supersym	any open source licensed freely enough algorithms would be cool too
2012-12-28 17:06:28	supersym	like image compression or easing/smoothing stuff,... should once become that a focal point
2012-12-28 17:07:30	supersym	you could cluster them with docpad-plugins-betterimages (by features around topic) or in a part like docpad core module for 'algorithms' and add that one for 'images' on the fly when installing that plugin
2012-12-28 17:07:36	supersym	or when used so much, to be part of the core
2012-12-28 17:07:54	supersym	because oauth is used so much
2012-12-28 17:08:18	supersym	but there might be others, non-auth protocols, that you'd need at some point
2012-12-28 17:09:46	supersym	because sticking to the naming/org of plugins by it's 'mashed up' web or desktop app (like Wordpress, or Google Docs or Dropbox) will all need say oauth
2012-12-28 17:10:44	supersym	do we want those to duplicate in each node_modules/docpad-plugin-* folder or link them to the node_modules/docpad or global $NODE_DIR folder
2012-12-28 17:14:11	supersym	normal non-tech savy users run away when they hear the word 'protocol' or 'algorithm;
2012-12-28 17:15:19	supersym	so its wise to think about those probably in terms of 'core modules' rather than public displayed functionality plugins with popular stuff they use
2012-12-28 17:16:23	supersym	probably just a extra docpad lib/ file would do or if many, a folder
2012-12-28 17:16:41	supersym	and do a check/require on the instance just like normal
2012-12-28 17:19:15	supersym	i guess also for (o)auth counts that the most simple would be just auth a specific service, later one could think about a mature/fine-grained own permissions system, but ofc those are complicated beasts in terms of logic, prone to hack-attempts and what not
2012-12-28 17:19:26	supersym	also less/simple=better
2012-12-28 17:20:22	supersym	some other thing to concider when expanding docpad and reaching the outer bounds of 3rd party stuff is ofc legal things and terms of use etc
2012-12-28 17:20:39	supersym	e.g. Gmail allows say like 500 mails per day per user
2012-12-28 17:21:06	supersym	but nothing says you can't help your users setup a gmail account through your app
2012-12-28 17:21:11	supersym	but in this case, the angle is
2012-12-28 17:21:23	supersym	you need to pay google to be able to write stuff for gmail
2012-12-28 17:21:47	supersym	that API is *not* fully open
2012-12-28 17:22:06	supersym	with my (and http://renderist.herokuapp.com) in mind
2012-12-28 17:22:55	supersym	that is another way we touch the outer bounds of someone elses server (http://www.plantuml.com) to render the documents text -> diagrams
2012-12-28 17:24:35	supersym	tho the site does not show any link to terms etc, I also dont know the terms of use for rendering images on their server
2012-12-28 17:25:05	supersym	its a java applet running btw, their latest and improved engine with way less dependencies on Graphviz
2012-12-28 17:25:21	supersym	which is another software challenge: dependencies :)
2012-12-28 17:25:43	supersym	npm we don't mind obviously: as open, free, extendable, complete and simple as possible
2012-12-28 17:27:31	supersym	learn from minor code projects who do one thing really well but don't really are major in LOC (say a 100 or so) you'd might convert/improve stuff to docpad (dom things?)
2012-12-28 17:28:27	supersym	if it's a really good, well maintained, mature but large codebase - and popular enough or feature rich - you'd might want to depend on it
2012-12-28 17:29:06	supersym	which brings one final obstacle which i am very devided upon and usually stop to think there, is to support package managers
2012-12-28 17:30:01	supersym	for me that is a logical full stop that you rarely, especially in our case, want to cross - are you going to support own exe? dpkg? rpm? etc naaaahhhhh
2012-12-28 17:30:13	supersym	same goes really for Java too
2012-12-28 17:30:36	supersym	I dont want people to have to install Java just for docpad, even a plugin with their full consent
2012-12-28 17:31:44	supersym	mind you: thats the only reason why I need to have a twofold approach on the diagram problem: install on your dev machine the jar (and thus JRE) or run it on a remote machine, have that render the images and return the MIME over tcp/ip
2012-12-28 17:32:14	supersym	someone might not have internet, that usually is a show-stopper, but ppl might not have js in their browser (also!)
2012-12-28 17:32:28	supersym	then again, ppl who dont have a full Java are prolly more widespread
2012-12-28 17:33:30	supersym	but if someone does have the JRE, then you have a node program which can just run it
2012-12-28 17:33:51	supersym	and it's command line options (of the jars) usually very complete and feature rich enough to do cool things with
2012-12-28 17:34:17	supersym	<STOP>
2012-12-28 17:34:21	supersym	sorry for the flood :)

2012-12-28 17:41:01	supersym	oh and i'd like a better integrated concept/implement which mashes up http://jashkenas.github.com/docco/ and 
2012-12-28 17:41:20	supersym	https://github.com/hughsk/colony
2012-12-28 17:41:43	supersym	together with a super-highlight code base i guess 
2012-12-28 17:42:04	supersym	both inspect files and index relations/entities based on regex
2012-12-28 17:42:59	supersym	and since regex really arent licensed i think (tho courtesy to mention people always!) we might also think about some internal lists of say regex
2012-12-28 17:43:24	supersym	then on the other hand, some are better in place in their own plugin, say a theoretical docpad-plugins-forms
2012-12-28 17:43:38	supersym	anyway thats futurist stuff :P
2012-12-28 17:44:51	supersym	but I'd really love to do some work on inline code comments of docpad stuff too,... because of documentation generation, and because it helps me learn coffeescript/javascript really quick in a deeper level
2012-12-28 17:48:53	supersym	even further away one could see docpad touching the boundries of clojurescript
2012-12-28 17:49:25	supersym	though coffee lacks the elegance of lisp, its also less complicated to grasp for most people
2012-12-28 17:49:38	supersym	and i setup my own environment today
2012-12-28 17:50:35	supersym	npm is friendlier tho https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen
2012-12-28 17:50:54	supersym	comes close... drawback is dependency on Java (again)
2012-12-28 17:51:07	supersym	and you atleast have to compile once I think
2012-12-28 17:51:37	supersym	http://clojurescriptone.com/ looks very promising as well
2012-12-28 17:52:51	supersym	ClojureScript is a new compiler for Clojure that targets JavaScript. It is designed to emit JavaScript code which is compatible with the advanced compilation mode of the Google Closure optimizing compiler.
2012-12-28 17:53:43	supersym	thats where the two worlds are really still apart
2012-12-28 17:54:56	supersym	but it shares some of its goals in "combining the approachability and interactive development of a scripting language with an efficient and robust infrastructure"
2012-12-28 17:55:16	supersym	but differs as in "it compiles directly to JVM bytecode, yet remains completely dynamic."
2012-12-28 17:55:21	supersym	thats Clojure anyway
2012-12-28 17:56:00	supersym	coffee just isn't code-as-data
2012-12-28 17:56:18	supersym	and docpad doesnt try to do that
2012-12-28 17:57:34	supersym	we leave greatly the original file and structure of that other language in tact
2012-12-28 17:58:39	supersym	sweet... i just caught a often occuring freeze of chrome while tracing (and thus not appearing way as often)
2012-12-28 17:59:00	supersym	bugreport!

2012-12-28 18:57:37	supersym	* oauth (7 13444)
2012-12-28 18:57:37	supersym	     Library for interacting with OAuth 1.0, 1.0A, 2 and Echo.  Provides simplified client access and allows for construction of more complex apis and OAuth providers.
2012-12-28 18:59:10	balupton	fixed the livereload issue, v2.2.0 of the livereload plugin is now out
2012-12-28 19:01:11	supersym	there we go: https://github.com/ciaranj/connect-auth
2012-12-28 19:01:16	supersym	nice :)
2012-12-28 19:01:54	balupton	I've used passportjs with success before
2012-12-28 19:02:24	balupton	however, chase (one of the docpad contributors) is pushing hard for firebase for the docpad website

2012-12-28 19:06:36	supersym	you'd be very dependent on the one provider of that service
2012-12-28 19:06:43	supersym	in this case firebase
2012-12-28 19:06:57	balupton	yeah
2012-12-28 19:07:01	supersym	i can see its really nice,... but they have 'pricing' plans
2012-12-28 19:07:05	balupton	I've loved the idea of parse.com
2012-12-28 19:07:12	balupton	and used parse for a few mobile apps
2012-12-28 19:07:18	balupton	but firebase seems to take it to a whole new level
2012-12-28 19:07:20	supersym	see this is what i like...never heard of that either ;)
2012-12-28 19:07:24	balupton	with the benefit of security
2012-12-28 19:07:36	balupton	but yeah, took me about 2 weeks for me to accept the notion
2012-12-28 19:08:51	supersym	well... on the other hand, if we dont mind heroku, nodejitsu or dropbox
2012-12-28 19:09:11	supersym	there is no 'ethical' reason not to use one of those either
2012-12-28 19:09:25	supersym	i always find it hard to trust them keeping stuff free
2012-12-28 19:09:38	supersym	seen too many times that services that were free
2012-12-28 19:09:49	supersym	get taken over, or become tuned down so much it dies
2012-12-28 19:10:12	supersym	but that would be a problem with any too much tight coupling in the cloud
2012-12-28 19:10:17	supersym	with 3rd parties
2012-12-28 19:10:47	supersym	eventually profit or greed seems to take over people
2012-12-28 19:10:58	supersym	and good stuff gets hijacked
2012-12-28 19:11:24	supersym	if only the source, see Sun and evil Oracle taking over Java after so many years
2012-12-28 19:11:40	supersym	very theoretical it could still happen to Linux kernel code as well
2012-12-28 19:11:48	supersym	tho no one would be stupid enough to try

2012-12-28 19:13:39	supersym	software development always boils down to dependency hell... but oh well
2012-12-28 19:13:54	supersym	thats how nature itself also works
2012-12-28 19:14:02	supersym	so no point in fighting that
2012-12-28 19:17:00	supersym	ideally, from the perspective of docpad and it's vision on 'freedom'
2012-12-28 19:17:32	supersym	you'd let a user decide on 'storage' and 'serving' capabilities
2012-12-28 19:18:02	supersym	within the capabilities of node.js and the best libraries / API / etc it has to offer under MIT
2012-12-28 19:18:46	supersym	docpad-platform-heroku, docpad-storage-gist, docpad-storage-googledrive, docpad-platform-googleappengine
2012-12-28 19:19:24	supersym	since we went overboard with the lean principle of 'less variation' we offer 'pick anything you like'
2012-12-28 19:20:42	supersym	then if someone wants heroku nosql database, thats different from the instance running the web server
2012-12-28 19:21:21	supersym	and you'd keep options open in terms 'free' and priced services they offer.. because in essence, thats what they are all about
2012-12-28 19:21:47	supersym	pull in users with free services and have them pay as soon as they want to use more/have more users/have more db connections/have more helpers
2012-12-28 19:22:29	supersym	it's a piece we wouldn't have to worry about because they protect their own systems against free people using paid stuff
2012-12-28 19:23:32	supersym	in most cased, all you'd have to do is to create an account, do oauth or ssh, build package, upload and deploy instance runs
2012-12-28 19:24:27	supersym	having already Procfiles and build packages or by looking at the already available oauth, or Google API stuff node has to offer, mashing them up (or loosely integrating them) into docpad wouldn't be too hard
2012-12-28 19:24:45	supersym	since most of those services are setup for easy browser/cli access anyway
2012-12-28 19:24:55	supersym	exposing some API or REST service
2012-12-28 19:25:46	supersym	you'd want to have some form of stereotype I guess that all share like 'account' and 'password' plus a 'token' for all the web services

2012-12-28 19:28:47	supersym	maybe it's me, but in a sense we already do that with analytics like GA
2012-12-28 19:29:11	supersym	several can be placed inside docpad.coffee with their auth token to identify the site

2012-12-28 22:21:46	supersym	learning them markdown even seems like a challenge sometimes
2012-12-28 22:22:08	ashnur	learning anything
2012-12-28 22:22:21	supersym	thanks :)
2012-12-28 22:22:25	supersym	i havent seen it yet
2012-12-28 22:22:49	ashnur	learning is what you do in school. you don't  have to learn anything after you left the educational system
2012-12-28 22:22:55	ashnur	that's the basic idea they have
2012-12-28 22:23:10	supersym	yup
2012-12-28 22:23:36	supersym	while learning can be so much fun and rewarding
2012-12-28 22:23:48	ashnur	and you better not watch that movie, it's really awful. but it's a good example where producers ignore not just science, but basic logic too. it's also terribly directed.
2012-12-28 22:24:01	supersym	hahah
2012-12-28 22:24:03	supersym	ok
2012-12-28 22:24:05	supersym	^^
2012-12-28 22:24:17	supersym	my friend, who is a designer
2012-12-28 22:24:32	supersym	would very much agree with average clients
2012-12-28 22:24:49	supersym	if its not drag/drop GUI then he thinks they won't get it
2012-12-28 22:24:53	supersym	and he's right of course
2012-12-28 22:25:19	supersym	but this does pose a problem for docpad and it's wish to reach out to just those people
2012-12-28 22:25:35	supersym	so you may wonder if somekind of Ace wouldnt be more helpful?
2012-12-28 22:26:14	supersym	because even a live update of markdown in the browser remember all those # and ` and - might be just too much
2012-12-28 22:26:27	ashnur	well, i think docpad is a resource for developers
2012-12-28 22:26:42	supersym	yeah some with limited, very limited, knowledge
2012-12-28 22:26:54	supersym	im not saying build a full GUI tho
2012-12-28 22:27:11	supersym	and im not sure how easily one can extend say a toolbar in Ace
2012-12-28 22:27:33	supersym	but you could imagine plugins being able to register a bar for some buttons... 
2012-12-28 22:28:07	supersym	then again like you said, most tech/lang inside docpad you need to know more then just basic HTML
2012-12-28 22:28:20	supersym	and are expected to be able and use notepad
2012-12-28 22:28:49	supersym	then again, I can stop writing plugins and executable CLI tools right? since all know commandline :P
2012-12-28 22:29:02	supersym	hook it up yourself :)
2012-12-28 22:29:04	ashnur	:)
2012-12-28 22:30:21	ashnur	i think a rest api for content admin, user admin and site admin would be great
2012-12-28 22:32:05	supersym	I dont hate GUI's btw...found them very useful when I didnt grasp a subject, on the science and the cli
2012-12-28 22:32:10	ashnur	also a layout editor which could set up areas in layouts with partials to include
2012-12-28 22:32:11	supersym	got used to the concept
2012-12-28 22:32:16	supersym	and then switched to cli
2012-12-28 22:32:29	ashnur	i am not talking about gui right now, just the information data change
2012-12-28 22:32:29	supersym	like with Gparted this was the case,....LVM
2012-12-28 22:32:35	supersym	ok
2012-12-28 22:32:39	ashnur	if docpad would have these apis
2012-12-28 22:32:45	ashnur	guis would be very easy to do
2012-12-28 22:32:46	supersym	but we humans like to visualize stuff
2012-12-28 22:32:51	supersym	they can be
2012-12-28 22:32:59	supersym	or they can be a nightmare...its all about choices
2012-12-28 22:33:11	supersym	yeah GUI wouldnt have to be too hardf
2012-12-28 22:33:20	supersym	with whats already there
2012-12-28 22:33:36	supersym	but if you want to make an API
2012-12-28 22:34:07	supersym	the model should be near complete for a v1
2012-12-28 22:34:18	supersym	im not sure how we stand on Admin and Users for example
2012-12-28 22:37:14	supersym	hookup a GUI should be just as simple as writing a CLI tool I guess
2012-12-28 22:37:24	supersym	everything is Commands and Options
2012-12-28 22:38:31	ashnur	if it's not a rest api, i don't like it
2012-12-28 22:38:39	supersym	nah you are right
2012-12-28 22:38:49	ashnur	:D
2012-12-28 22:38:53	supersym	RESTful is the future anyway
2012-12-28 22:38:55	supersym	anticipate
2012-12-28 22:41:04	supersym	http://www.thebuzzmedia.com/designing-a-secure-rest-api-without-oauth-authentication/
2012-12-28 22:42:21	supersym	they use HMAC pub/private key handshakes
2012-12-28 22:42:24	supersym	You also slowly realize and accept that at some point you will have to implement OAuth, but it will probably be OAuth 2.0 support and that isn’t quite ready yet.
2012-12-28 22:53:13	supersym	imma working on my CLI tool building skills in coffee... always useful and I got tired of copy paste stuff in a docpad plugin so might as well write a tool 
2012-12-28 22:54:06	supersym	i guess i should also have it fetch and bundle Readme documents in preparation for a true document generator with good indexing and language construct features that handles coffee
2012-12-28 22:54:37	supersym	i hate looking up stuff as `cat ../../node_modules/docpad-plugin-something`
2012-12-28 22:55:01	supersym	Im so lazy... I'm even proud of it at times

2012-12-30 15:52:01	balupton	frederic, seems like the error you had could have been caused by a missing endquote for the string
2012-12-30 15:52:08	balupton	e.g. "hello
2012-12-30 15:52:13	balupton	or something following the string: "hello" a
2012-12-30 15:52:30	balupton	"hello" a, would become "hello"(a) - which isn't valid JS

2012-12-30 16:04:53	balupton	often that'll happen when you forget a comma when separating arguments to a function call
2012-12-30 16:05:03	balupton	happens to me a fair bit too :)
2012-12-30 16:05:48	frederic	balupton: there must be something but I can't get it ... the strange thing is that without adding a helper function it was working properly but couldn't add a function...
2012-12-30 16:06:18	frederic	I mean it's not like it did not work at all :)
2012-12-30 16:08:39	frederic	What's the easiest approach to put the file online, in case you want to have a look? (something that you desperately can't find will usually seem obvious to another observer :) )
2012-12-30 16:26:58	frederic	created a gist: https://gist.github.com/4413625
2012-12-30 16:29:49	frederic	now the strange thing is that keywords and description don't seem to have the ending """.... but if you look in raw format it does... any coffeescript educated guy have any clue?
2012-12-30 16:33:06	balupton	frederic, the """ ending is showing up for me - the only issue I can see is that the getTest line is indented with spaces, whereas everything else is indented with tabs
2012-12-30 16:33:19	balupton	as coffeescript is indentation based, that matters
2012-12-30 16:34:52	balupton	yep that indentation is what caused the issue, check out the compiled js output using "try coffeescript" on coffeescript.org
2012-12-30 16:36:59	frederic	that sounds really strange because as an alternative i also tried to just copy getPrepareKeywords function and change the name and had the exact same result...
2012-12-30 16:37:38	frederic	Could be webstorm that was messing with space tabs?
2012-12-30 16:39:47	frederic	@provocative_mode: -> remind me of not adopting coffeescript - those identation problems can just make you crazy
2012-12-30 16:56:45	frederic	The problem is that I didn't keep a copy of the faulty docpad.coffee but copied the content in an opened notepad++ open window ... In the gist file, I just copied from notepad++ to gist... Because of this dependency on tabs/spaces, quite a few things could have happened from webstorm to gist (through notepad++)
2012-12-30 16:58:42	frederic	if you ask me, coffeescript could be a good idea without this dependency on indentation... but of course one may disagree.

2012-12-30 17:19:49	balupton	without depending on indentation, you'll require closing brackets, which would diminish the philosophy
2012-12-30 17:20:23	balupton	it's not an issue if you are aware of it :)
2012-12-30 17:31:09	frederic	coffeescript brings many nifty things besides the no-";"-or-"()" philosophy ... would have been possible to have something in the middle that would have been just as great...

2012-12-31 00:40:26	frederic	any way to pass additional parameters when writing collections in docpad.coffee?
2012-12-31 00:45:31	frederic	for instance: @getCollection('productPages', @document.product).toJSON()
2012-12-31 00:46:17	frederic	meaning that I want product pages for the specific product "@document.product" that I want to pass as a parameter...

2012-12-31 01:00:53	balupton	sounds like a template helper

2013-01-01 04:10:56	ashnur	another problem is that currently the articles are identified by filename (so i don't do any search, just write over them when they get updated).
2013-01-01 04:11:31	ashnur	this is not good obviously because if the title gets changed (or rather, the slug), then it will duplicate the article
2013-01-01 04:12:01	ashnur	so i have to come up with something to remove the old article-document in such cases

2013-01-01 23:20:42	supersym	any chance we like to integrate this?
2013-01-01 23:22:16	supersym	also,...where does docpad stand in regard to grunt... do we want/need overlap features, or do we integrate/wrap their tasks, or do we avoid anything already done good in grunt?

2013-01-02 00:40:14	qwebirc17267	so I just deployed to nodejitsu but am getting this now:

2013-01-02 00:42:00	qwebirc17267	I think maybe it's something to do with either my package.json or the fact that I edited the docpad.coffee file.

2013-01-02 04:19:04	balupton	supersym: grunt, bower, yeoman, etc are all tools we can use alongside grunt
2013-01-02 04:19:11	balupton	alongside docpad*
2013-01-02 04:19:43	balupton	I don't think we should redo their functionality just because we can, but only if we must
2013-01-02 04:19:52	balupton	always better to work together than against :)
2013-01-02 04:20:14	balupton	here is a gist for grunt integration with docpad - https://gist.github.com/3898915

2013-01-02 04:58:20	ashnur	I am having trouble understanding javascript apparently
2013-01-02 04:58:30	ashnur	it's so frustrating 
2013-01-02 05:00:31	supersym	https://github.com/supersym/docpad
2013-01-02 05:01:03	supersym	i forked docpad, decided I should try and learn a clean method of decorating cs code
2013-01-02 05:02:30	supersym	eventually I would like to get some more static analysis details and generate diagrams and graphs from cs code :)
2013-01-02 05:03:41	supersym	now I dont know if you concidered this b4 balupton? And if this would be everyones choice (coda util for doc generation)
2013-01-02 05:04:02	supersym	but i like its output and fine-grained options

2013-01-02 06:42:45	balupton	http://tekpub.com/shows/the_source/3 - awesome :)
2013-01-02 06:43:26	balupton	supersym: nah haven't considered it at all, keen to see what you have in mind though
2013-01-02 06:43:31	balupton	:)
2013-01-02 06:43:40	supersym	cool
2013-01-02 06:46:28	supersym	its gonna take atleast 2,3 full reviews before its flawless, correct and uniform in all its decoration but getting along ok...
2013-01-02 06:47:03	supersym	sometimes maybe a tad too much details but that won't really hurt....
2013-01-02 06:48:22	supersym	in time it would be nice though if you could skim through them and provide some additional information perhaps on how stuff came to be (@since) and @todo plans for future shape
2013-01-02 06:49:40	supersym	but i guess i can distil most from the source anyway and it works like it works because of the Backbone/QueryEngine backend which more or less force it to confirm to the structure of collections, views, models

2013-01-02 06:56:53	balupton	supersym: cool, so your plan is to add those meta comments to docpad?
2013-01-02 06:56:59	balupton	or just understand the codebase better?
2013-01-02 06:57:09	supersym	both actually
2013-01-02 06:57:31	supersym	its a serious attempt initially
2013-01-02 06:58:07	supersym	i found some important details not highlighted enough to my liking in the official documentation as well, and since i didnt have backbone background / experience
2013-01-02 06:58:15	supersym	its a double edged sword
2013-01-02 06:58:42	supersym	Also there are some gaps in what we can do with coffeescript code analysis and graphing
2013-01-02 06:59:17	supersym	but there are great tools that combined make a perfect setup
2013-01-02 06:59:55	supersym	and I figured this would be especially useful in a large landscape of plugins and dependencies/polymorphism
2013-01-02 07:01:22	supersym	either way... for any charts or diagrams to be meaningful, I'd had to abstract and enrich the source anyway,..for example the great thing you can set [Model] or [Documents] as a datatype
2013-01-02 07:02:20	supersym	and I like @examples a lot btw..plus mixins / includes etc :)
2013-01-02 07:04:33	supersym	So anyway, in every tool I reviewed so far, either documentation generator or source code highlighter was leveraged to extract statistics/data on the nature of the code
2013-01-02 07:05:05	supersym	and good tools become sparse in the domain of js, esp coffeescript
2013-01-02 07:05:47	supersym	though Google closure compiler suppisedly has a very good static analysis tool
2013-01-02 07:06:17	supersym	which all comes more nicely together when doing code coverage /metrics to design tests...
2013-01-02 07:07:15	supersym	and when complexity increases, of new and current plugins/core, eventually you will want to better designate the tests that you write to target parts specifically
2013-01-02 07:09:56	supersym	ofc it would also be some extra 'candy' to bring to the evolution of docpad as a utility, it's features, and - if done nicely - be perhaps some stuff Google / Github searches end up at because the combo Coffeescript + Analysis / Graphing / UML is so rare
2013-01-02 07:14:00	supersym	lastely...nothing gives the amount of detail, and insight, into the inner workings of a framework
2013-01-02 07:22:37	supersym	besides d3 a very one is http://arborjs.org - node placement engine looks really good...better zoom/snap probably than d3 so far

2013-01-02 07:35:39	mikeumus	so I have "-> @content" in my default.html.coffee file but it's not inserting anything there.
2013-01-02 07:35:47	mikeumus	I did get a warning
2013-01-02 07:36:08	mikeumus	about my index.html.eco
2013-01-02 07:36:18	mikeumus	about the dot html dot eco
2013-01-02 07:36:34	supersym	compile with -d switch for debugging output
2013-01-02 07:36:51	supersym	it'll give you a better starting point probably
2013-01-02 07:37:05	mikeumus	can I just name my file index-html.eco to bypass this for now ?
2013-01-02 07:37:16	supersym	nop
2013-01-02 07:37:24	mikeumus	I did that with the other js files with .versions
2013-01-02 07:37:27	mikeumus	ok
2013-01-02 07:37:36	supersym	errors, more or less all them, need to be solved rightaway
2013-01-02 07:37:55	supersym	but a stylus error is not fatal to rendering for example
2013-01-02 07:38:16	supersym	but without @content you have no document layout system :P
2013-01-02 07:39:27	mikeumus	warning:                                                                                                                                                                                       Rendering the extension "eco" to "html" on "index.html.eco" didn't do anything.    
2013-01-02 07:42:13	mikeumus	I think that warning may be irrelevant though huh?
2013-01-02 07:42:26	mikeumus	I think insterad of -> @content I just need @content
2013-01-02 07:42:30	mikeumus	I don't know
2013-01-02 07:42:48	mikeumus	but I'll know in a second once it deploys
2013-01-02 07:52:54	mikeumus	okay so is it supposed to have a warning when running "docpad run" for .html.eco?
2013-01-02 07:54:51	mikeumus	ohh I tihnk I found my problem I ho[pe

2013-01-02 10:25:03	balupton	hence why I feel it is quite fidgety
2013-01-02 10:25:34	balupton	just pushed up https://github.com/docpad/docpad-plugin-nativecomments - it works, but needs a lot of cleaning up

2013-01-02 10:51:28	supersym	ok :)
2013-01-02 10:51:34	balupton	we get around this by having bal-util specified as a bundledDependency within joe

2013-01-02 11:00:32	supersym	seen gist.io btw? also I see the easiest way to utilize the github or gist API as well as others
2013-01-02 11:00:47	supersym	is using a router like express
2013-01-02 11:02:03	supersym	https://github.com/supersym/gistio/blob/master/gistio.py i dont see why i wouldnt be able to rewrite that to coffee on node
2013-01-02 11:07:24	supersym	also how about http://www.coffeelint.org/
2013-01-02 11:08:26	supersym	i like the idea but having a linter like that really moves docpad away from the unbiased editorless?? -> browser as IDE
2013-01-02 11:15:35	supersym	http://codegram.github.com/pelusa/ would make a nice candidate for porting to coffee if any
2013-01-02 11:19:04	supersym	about the gists API etc... curl is another option dunno what ill find more pref

2013-01-02 13:53:46	supersym	I don't know too much about what kind of pattern/generalization you used with BB.Models as data though and if we can extend that to remove data, transfer and optionally *then* create a that as a BB.Model if that works better

2013-01-02 16:00:51	supersym	lol
2013-01-02 16:01:21	ashnur	seriously, think about this, i have to create a program flow wich has loops and branches in it. 
2013-01-02 16:01:38	ashnur	loop as in graph theory, not as a for or while loop :)
2013-01-02 16:02:03	ashnur	and i've just realized that the branching has basicly two options
2013-01-02 16:02:12	ashnur	either keep, break, or break, break
2013-01-02 16:02:21	ashnur	which esentially means, that every break is a dead end
2013-01-02 16:02:59	ashnur	so when I check for an exists dir, I can't make a function which breaks when the directory doesn't exists, and then goes back to the keep branch
2013-01-02 16:03:34	ashnur	i don't understand why
2013-01-02 16:03:40	ashnur	but it seems to be the case
2013-01-02 16:03:55	supersym	probably because it can't make a promise this way?
2013-01-02 16:04:05	ashnur	i don't know
2013-01-02 16:04:07	supersym	doesnt it have to be calculatable the outcome with that framework?
2013-01-02 16:04:16	ashnur	?
2013-01-02 16:06:09	supersym	http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Promises
2013-01-02 16:06:32	supersym	checked those points? Im not sure what you mean now but the logic/algorithm might help to point it down
2013-01-02 16:06:40	supersym	 that permits the function to either forward the failure of its input, or recover from that failure by forwarding a resolved value, or recover by forwarding a new promise to eventually resolve or fail later.
2013-01-02 16:07:05	supersym	seems like it has regular callbacks to prevent it 'just breaking'
2013-01-02 16:07:16	supersym	and instead return the value or postpone
2013-01-02 16:07:34	supersym	i've never worked with promises tho
2013-01-02 16:09:44	ashnur	no, i have not checked this wiki
2013-01-02 16:10:02	ashnur	i've been trying to graps through this: https://github.com/douglascrockford/monad/blob/master/vow.js
2013-01-02 16:10:29	ashnur	grasp*
2013-01-02 16:12:40	supersym	well it prolly has an error...any exceptions?
2013-01-02 16:12:51	supersym	its ment to break so i see :P
2013-01-02 16:13:23	ashnur	:)
2013-01-02 16:13:38	ashnur	i must read a bit more i guess
2013-01-02 16:14:05	supersym	and its got strict on...so that will break some bad code too

2013-01-02 16:41:51	balupton	don't yet have a solution for text yet - there is a discussion about the options here https://github.com/bevry/docpad/issues/17
2013-01-02 16:42:04	balupton	it wouldn't be that hard to do, but no one has needed to do it yet

2013-01-02 16:43:22	zenorocha	let's see what I can do with those options
2013-01-02 16:44:24	supersym	Yeah its gonna mean some overhauling of constants to a internationalization library module
2013-01-02 16:44:52	supersym	but always a nice chance to standardize status messages as well :)
2013-01-02 16:48:41	balupton	yeah :)
2013-01-02 16:48:47	balupton	it sure would be a fantastic task
2013-01-02 16:49:41	supersym	i should expect no too daunting, it's not like we constantly output a huge variety of log messages

2013-01-02 17:49:44	ashnur	not bad

2013-01-02 18:24:30	supersym	appearantly API servers should be approached (normally) by repetively including the auth token in the http header..so i won't have to resort to connect or express (for persistent login using sessions)
2013-01-02 18:25:29	supersym	written strategies local and oauth2 now, i'll add facebook, twitter and openid later
2013-01-02 18:34:40	supersym	currently i think I do it like this: base auth (openid, oauth1,2 etc), local and generic strategies used will be appended to docpad-plugin-passport src/lib/strategies or just src/strats or something
2013-01-02 18:35:17	supersym	modified dp-plug-gist dependency on that plugin plus additional passport-github strategy
2013-01-02 18:35:54	supersym	API specific implementation of auth scheme members, variable names and what not goes together with that plugin
2013-01-02 18:36:09	supersym	e.g. facebook (auth) api comes with docpad-plugin-facebook
2013-01-02 18:36:57	supersym	as integral (optional or not) part of additional features you support, like easy listing all your contacts or repositories, rendering gist to document source etc
2013-01-02 18:37:40	supersym	which come as templatedata helper functions, object literals (config etc), custom collections or model, or even meta-data if thats handy
2013-01-02 18:38:36	supersym	getDocument().getRemoteSource(id) might feed the remote data to the rendering plugin of whatever that gist is written in
2013-01-02 18:39:15	supersym	or getRepos() might generate a html list of all repositories and their absolute references
2013-01-02 18:40:29	supersym	also I am heavily testing the document, graph and diagram engines I found suitable and best in their field for docpad/coffee/node

2013-01-03 00:23:22	balupton	cool links btw
2013-01-03 00:26:19	supersym	yeah sometimes i keep finding cool app/site after another :S
2013-01-03 00:26:27	supersym	chill
2013-01-03 00:29:13	balupton	Abstract all the things - https://github.com/bevry/docpad/issues?milestone=16&state=open - what else could we abstract out of the docpad core?
2013-01-03 00:31:17	supersym	i'll give it a look
2013-01-03 00:33:54	supersym	the plugin loader isnt going to be easy... you'll want a docpad instance of some sort, either stand-alone or as express module
2013-01-03 00:34:41	supersym	what would plugins plugin to? eachother? I was thinking about extending and plugin interaction in some useful way... but i don't really see it yet
2013-01-03 00:35:06	supersym	see docpad in many respects is the glue to bind everything
2013-01-03 00:35:33	supersym	because it provides the base classes, Models, Collections and with LiveReload etc working no hassle
2013-01-03 00:35:57	supersym	you could imagine a web service rendering instance though
2013-01-03 00:36:23	supersym	much like renderist, plantuml etc offer... could easily remain a heroku app for a while
2013-01-03 00:36:49	supersym	you could also focus heavily on the OOP 
2013-01-03 00:37:08	supersym	and offer extendible classes for others..which is near API like I guess
2013-01-03 00:38:09	supersym	and you'd get quite formal in declaring the exact outline of plugins and can't tweak too much of ppl's stuff will break
2013-01-03 00:38:34	supersym	thats the big downside ofc: we'd have to integrate stuff, not others into docpad
2013-01-03 00:38:54	supersym	though anyone can read the source and still write their own plugins
2013-01-03 00:39:38	supersym	thats why i started drawing some outline for an idea to have docpad-plugin-plugins and instead offer a nice plugin build tool (reminds me to check out buildr)
2013-01-03 00:40:52	supersym	also some related perhaps, perhaps not, but i feel somehow queryengine for me is very invisible and hard to 'get'
2013-01-03 00:41:20	supersym	but the demo and live collections sound really awesome...
2013-01-03 00:42:38	supersym	some effort in enhancing perhaps some interaction or just a few little candy snippets inside a plugin boilerplate/generator to trigger intrest
2013-01-03 00:43:29	supersym	but above all... i really feel there is a steady move towards both microframeworks as well as in-browser mashup apps
2013-01-03 00:43:39	supersym	much like the coffeetables one perhaps
2013-01-03 00:46:24	supersym	how sweet would it be to have a browser window, write/generate comment documentation + code snippets inline edit + highlight with intellisense to a command bar and docpad properties and methods available to live/saas render your writings ~> HTML static server spawn+host+datastore all free? and in the end (yeah going way over the top I know but it's part of the mind-tricks to fantasize the possibilities) 
2013-01-03 00:47:19	supersym	that i would also classify as a move towards IDE/GUI for HTML content rendering framework
2013-01-03 00:48:18	supersym	it makes docpad itself sometimes hard to describe/classify because it doesnt conform to a traditional CMS, it bundles a lot of stuff which gives it the char. of a mashup utility
2013-01-03 00:48:43	supersym	we don't only just make wrappers, but a lot of the 1 line of code cool tricks are possible of course thanks to npm
2013-01-03 00:49:20	supersym	but i think of how many apps on github/npm i've already seen, but even more i missed in a very intensive search for cool stuff the past year
2013-01-03 00:50:09	supersym	anyone who's not looking is very likely never to hear from it, while that npm package a lone might not do much, combined in your docpad it could be the missing link in your static web automation process
2013-01-03 00:51:12	supersym	so i might be very tempted to keep asking you 'how about this' and 'can't we integrate that'
2013-01-03 00:55:59	supersym	about the plugin loading tho second thought
2013-01-03 00:56:30	supersym	i guess you'd be able to discover package details by doing analysis of its source code
2013-01-03 00:57:28	supersym	say if Commander object found, we inspect option flags etc. to find out what switches/features the cli tool has, read for standard file / dir naming conventions, inspect classes and its parents etc.
2013-01-03 00:58:44	supersym	if you find say stuff to derive from Backbone.Model like we do, that would allow you to 'blindfold' expose some plugin features like add stuff to collections (naive i know) 
2013-01-03 01:00:32	supersym	something like that would more allow for a 'drop in folder' -> loads-plugin idea
2013-01-03 01:01:10	supersym	but hardest might be stuff that iced coffeescript is trying to solve
2013-01-03 01:01:24	supersym	switching from sync to async and back
2013-01-03 01:04:19	supersym	to be truely unopinionated in this sense, would solve part or problem in trying to determine 'what is useful' and 'what not' because that is not up to us to decide
2013-01-03 01:04:55	supersym	assume user to be smart enough to know he/she needs/wants plugin/rendering engine A or B but not smart enough to implement the integration in docpad themselves
2013-01-03 01:05:01	supersym	am I correct?
2013-01-03 01:06:50	supersym	a rigid and specific set of demands on the technology requires a tool that is near limitless in its flexibility trying to facilitate those wishes 
2013-01-03 01:10:22	supersym	something much like what browserify and ender try to do: concat js in dependency tree regardless if that npm package was intended for them to use or not
2013-01-03 01:10:43	supersym	am i correct to assume that is what you mean by 'abstracting out the plugin loader'?

2013-01-03 16:15:59	supersym	dp-plugin-cleanurls
2013-01-03 16:16:12	supersym	i think thats what you want at least
2013-01-03 16:16:49	supersym	keep in mind, this won't persist to production if your site remains static
2013-01-03 16:18:53	qwebirc19291	thanks for the tip!
2013-01-03 16:19:11	qwebirc19291	went to check it out, not much in the readme so don't really get what it does
2013-01-03 16:19:13	supersym	you'd either need a docpad-server running or have like Apache rewrite the urls for you
2013-01-03 16:19:21	supersym	it removes the .html etc
2013-01-03 16:19:27	qwebirc19291	i see
2013-01-03 16:19:34	supersym	also if you like, you can have a slug path in meta-data
2013-01-03 16:19:47	qwebirc19291	jekyll calls every file index.html and puts it in a folder
2013-01-03 16:19:59	qwebirc19291	like: /my-post/index.html
2013-01-03 16:20:03	supersym	so mysite.com/folder/to/use/index.html ~> mysite.com/folder/to/use
2013-01-03 16:20:07	qwebirc19291	instead of /my-post.hml
2013-01-03 16:20:09	supersym	index gets removed as well
2013-01-03 16:20:13	supersym	and is the default
2013-01-03 16:20:42	qwebirc19291	ah i see
2013-01-03 16:20:48	qwebirc19291	so seems to work the same way
2013-01-03 16:20:55	supersym	but in that file you could also set url
2013-01-03 16:20:55	supersym	The url that you would like to use as the primary url for the document. When a user accesses a document via a secondary url, the user will be redirected to the primary url automatically.
2013-01-03 16:21:10	supersym	seems slug is deprecated in favor of setter for url
2013-01-03 16:21:36	supersym	urls
2013-01-03 16:21:36	supersym	Urls is the secondary urls for a document. It can be a comma seperated values list, or an array of values.
2013-01-03 16:22:13	qwebirc19291	got it
2013-01-03 16:22:25	qwebirc19291	any way, i'll have to check docpad out
2013-01-03 16:22:25	supersym	yeah commenting and plugin readme's is also on my list :P
2013-01-03 16:22:44	qwebirc19291	i've used jekyll before but docpad looks pretty neat!
2013-01-03 16:22:48	supersym	thats the idea :P
2013-01-03 16:23:26	supersym	oh hell yeah
2013-01-03 16:23:36	qwebirc19291	and being a javascript dev and not a ruby guy, docpad is attractive :)
2013-01-03 16:23:46	supersym	not much that comes close to what it does...
2013-01-03 16:24:02	supersym	you can have any lang you want
2013-01-03 16:24:22	supersym	its architecture is elegantly simple and efficient
2013-01-03 16:24:36	supersym	so hooking up renderers or helpers isn't too hard
2013-01-03 16:24:54	qwebirc19291	yes, and i'm a big fan of "unix philosophy" i.e. small tools that do one job good and are easy to hook up together
2013-01-03 16:25:04	qwebirc19291	docpad seems to follow that
2013-01-03 16:25:19	supersym	right same here
2013-01-03 16:25:31	qwebirc19291	cool stuff
2013-01-03 16:25:36	qwebirc19291	all right thanks for your help!

2013-01-03 17:04:52	flatour	I'd like to come up with a download page: is there some easy way to loop over some files and get their size. For instance, I could have the filename of the files as metadata (an array) in a document... I would then loop over those files in order to get their download size automatically?
2013-01-03 17:07:24	supersym	the file name you can get from any in the collections
2013-01-03 17:08:17	flatour	not sure I understand what you mean
2013-01-03 17:08:23	supersym	if you want their size I guess you'd need to make a helper function I guess...or look one up fs isnt too hard
2013-01-03 17:08:30	supersym	say I work in jade
2013-01-03 17:08:51	supersym	- for file in getDocument().getCollection('files')

2013-01-03 17:09:49	supersym	would give you the paths of all files under src/files
2013-01-03 17:10:08	supersym	but i dont think the docpad file model holds information about it's size
2013-01-03 17:10:39	flatour	the most problematic is the size
2013-01-03 17:10:40	supersym	so you'd have to require the 'fs' module in node and probably fetch their sizes 
2013-01-03 17:12:01	supersym	fs.readdir(path, [callback])
2013-01-03 17:12:01	supersym	Asynchronous readdir(3). Reads the contents of a directory. The callback gets two arguments (err, files) where files is an array of the names of the files in the directory excluding '.' and '..'.
2013-01-03 17:12:30	flatour	sounds suddenly more complicate than it should be :)
2013-01-03 17:12:38	supersym	that you'd want to call from say getFileSize: ->
2013-01-03 17:12:48	supersym	as a custom helper function in docpad.cson
2013-01-03 17:13:00	supersym	or use synchronous
2013-01-03 17:13:09	supersym	but let me check the model to make sure :P
2013-01-03 17:13:31	flatour	I checked the metadata page and no mention of file size ...
2013-01-03 17:13:45	supersym	https://github.com/bevry/docpad/blob/master/src/lib/models/file.coffee
2013-01-03 17:14:17	supersym	docpad files are added to Collections (QueryEngine which derive from Backbone.Collection)
2013-01-03 17:14:46	supersym	which are collections of models, and models are representations of data
2013-01-03 17:15:13	supersym	thats just how backbone-like architectures work MVC (C for Collections instead of Controller)
2013-01-03 17:15:38	flatour	maybe it would be easier to amend docpad so that the size is being available as part of the data?
2013-01-03 17:16:12	supersym	line 161... you see that internally we do much the same as in docpad.cson
2013-01-03 17:16:26	supersym	only those are members of the templateData instance
2013-01-03 17:16:45	supersym	while here they'd be in the base class or so 
2013-01-03 17:18:00	supersym	imho since its not something used often, instead specific, would just go for a helper
2013-01-03 17:18:11	supersym	and read the info from the directory
2013-01-03 17:18:33	supersym	instead of overhead on any derived class, checking size after loading the file...
2013-01-03 17:19:00	supersym	but then again, that 'data' object in FileModel, I'm not sure what it exactly holds
2013-01-03 17:19:06	flatour	any download page in a web site needs this information...
2013-01-03 17:19:24	flatour	I would not go for a helper...
2013-01-03 17:19:37	supersym	getStat might also be a possible candidate if any holds that data
2013-01-03 17:20:00	flatour	This is static generation ... it doesn't really matter if it takes some time...
2013-01-03 17:20:26	supersym	nah stat holds time/date of rendering info

2013-01-03 17:27:26	supersym	shoot
2013-01-03 17:30:24	flatour	I'll explain in several steps...let's say I'm rendering some document to html - could be a ".md" or ".html" or ".haml" or ".coffee", whatever...
2013-01-03 17:31:18	flatour	besides some text, there are a few images rendered using img tag...
2013-01-03 17:32:14	flatour	now instead of "dumbly" (so to speak) render my img, I would like to render them differently depending on the actual size of the image...
2013-01-03 17:34:02	flatour	if image.width greater than 700, add size constraint to the "img" tag ... else just a simple img (meaning it will use actual image size)
2013-01-03 17:35:10	supersym	you want a resonsive design or?
2013-01-03 17:35:32	supersym	why not use viewports and max-width @media queries
2013-01-03 17:36:24	flatour	no the idea is that if my image is greater than some size, I'll use some lightbox... if not, I'll just display the entire image
2013-01-03 17:37:10	supersym	if you really want to 'render' the images, you mean physical fopen() -> resize -> fprintf
2013-01-03 17:37:33	supersym	i wouldnt ever really do that
2013-01-03 17:37:45	flatour	it means I should be able to hook up into the parsing process

2013-01-03 17:38:02	supersym	the source is being rendered
2013-01-03 17:38:24	supersym	atm docpad does not have a image rendering engine for, say, better compression and conversion to base64
2013-01-03 17:38:34	supersym	im working on that as a plugin tho...
2013-01-03 17:39:16	supersym	there would be some minor line of code somewhere in a plugin, i recall something like dp-plugin-frontend or something to work with the collection
2013-01-03 17:39:20	supersym	of images
2013-01-03 17:39:50	supersym	which you could define in meta-data as well, or have them get pulled based on Associated Files or Related plugins
2013-01-03 17:39:52	flatour	do you know if can hookup into markdown processing... 
2013-01-03 17:40:01	supersym	but thats all not really what you want
2013-01-03 17:41:20	flatour	can I have my very own function as part of markdown processing...
2013-01-03 17:42:13	flatour	or maybe I can use coffeekup
2013-01-03 17:42:14	supersym	so you should hook onto an event and listen for it to reach that stage and fire, then pull all the <img src=''> or img(src='') tag attribute values depending what pass you are going over the file extensions (each being a rendering cycle)
2013-01-03 17:42:25	flatour	it will let me write my own function if I can remember
2013-01-03 17:42:27	supersym	yeah you can hack in everywhere you like
2013-01-03 17:42:56	supersym	yes... docpad.cson is a good spot, stuff in there has access to the @document context
2013-01-03 17:43:28	supersym	and you can register an event listener (server extend) i believe
2013-01-03 17:43:57	supersym	that, or you have like a Grunt task, Cake or regular shell
2013-01-03 17:44:12	supersym	or write a plugin if you may have bigger plans to use it often
2013-01-03 17:44:40	supersym	whatever you like... just clone the docpad github repository to get the coffee-script source files
2013-01-03 17:45:03	supersym	don't npm install it, if you want to extend on any of the (base) classes
2013-01-03 17:45:20	supersym	that is hack into the core files at src/ 
2013-01-03 17:46:24	flatour	To tell the truth I don't follow you :)
2013-01-03 17:47:00	flatour	the fact of the matter is that I'm not necessarily very clear myself... :)
2013-01-03 17:47:14	supersym	simple: option a) you want to permanently resize the files -> file system operation (require fs)
2013-01-03 17:47:46	supersym	if you need to do that a lot, you want to automate that maybe, if once: i still use gimp etc. a lot
2013-01-03 17:47:58	supersym	if you only have MS Paint that sucks :P
2013-01-03 17:48:13	supersym	but if you want to resize the file inside the browser only
2013-01-03 17:49:03	supersym	you can do that the crude way: just have say jQuery selector manipulate the DOM element img tag set attr 'height' and 'width'
2013-01-03 17:49:49	supersym	or do it inside a stylesheet, which would be the proper place to do it if the images is part of the style/theme and not so much a HTML semantic meaning
2013-01-03 17:50:16	supersym	because with nearly every element we set attr height and width inside css, not the html file
2013-01-03 17:50:30	supersym	style="" inline => bad
2013-01-03 17:50:59	supersym	but img and figure it's concidered correct to do it inside the element if it's part of the site content
2013-01-03 17:51:08	supersym	like a gallery or article illustrations
2013-01-03 17:51:28	flatour	what I want is that I want to apply the proper img tag and possibly surrounding tag depending on the actual image size... I don't want to change the image size ...
2013-01-03 17:52:00	supersym	ok
2013-01-03 17:52:31	flatour	if the image size is too big (for the width of my web site) I want do diplay part of the image and by clicking on the image I can see it all ...using some lightbox plugin
2013-01-03 17:52:32	supersym	then you would have to do that manually normally, or use zen html (you can fetch size easily)
2013-01-03 17:53:04	supersym	just set overflow or x-repeat
2013-01-03 17:53:22	supersym	if all you want to do is to 'cut' off
2013-01-03 17:54:01	supersym	thats all client side
2013-01-03 17:54:55	supersym	so use responsive css features if you want to have it look good at say 400px wide window
2013-01-03 17:55:43	flatour	I do agree to use some kind of markup in my source document to specify that this image should be handled this specific way: for instance, if I use markdown... that's ok for instance to write MY_IMAGEAPPROACH(![](/images/someimage.png))
2013-01-03 17:56:58	flatour	I don't get your client side approach...
2013-01-03 17:58:03	supersym	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design
2013-01-03 17:58:13	flatour	well, no, I see your point ...
2013-01-03 17:58:29	supersym	also you might be interested in http://adaptive-images.com/
2013-01-03 17:58:44	flatour	at some point with a responsive approach, any image could be too small
2013-01-03 17:59:03	supersym	i dont think that is valid markdown
2013-01-03 17:59:19	supersym	but if you'd want that, you'd have to extend on the rendering engine marked
2013-01-03 17:59:42	supersym	which is, not for beginners anyway
2013-01-03 17:59:53	flatour	sure it's not valid markdown ... but I was wondering if I could bring my own function within markdown processing... (or maybe my own markup)
2013-01-03 18:00:34	supersym	https://github.com/docpad/docpad-plugin-text
2013-01-03 18:02:14	supersym	thats a plugin for more 'text based' rendering based upon arbitrary tags
2013-01-03 18:05:00	flatour	regarding the images... if you look at this web pages... part of the images are displayed and if you click on the image, you'll get the entire image: http://www.enesyssoftware.com/language/en-US/Products/EnesysRSDataExtension/WhatsNew.aspx
2013-01-03 18:06:53	supersym	sec let me trace that function
2013-01-03 18:06:56	flatour	if the image was small enough, it should be displayed as is without any lightbox plugin on top... that this kind of processing I wanted to achieve ...
2013-01-03 18:07:01	supersym	and see what lib facilitates it
2013-01-03 18:07:16	supersym	because cropping is a built in feature of... lightbox?
2013-01-03 18:07:27	supersym	roger..
2013-01-03 18:07:31	supersym	i get it finally :)
2013-01-03 18:11:43	flatour	it could be a kind of function or macro and within this function, I would need to get actual image size and depending on the size, I would generate the necessary tags for the image...
2013-01-03 18:13:49	supersym	yeah they're css rules
2013-01-03 18:13:51	supersym	nothing more
2013-01-03 18:13:59	flatour	amongst the various language : jade, haml, coffekup, ... is there one that makes it easy to use a function for emitting my own tags?
2013-01-03 18:15:05	supersym	element.style {
2013-01-03 18:15:05	supersym	    background-image: url("/Portals/0/Images/ersde/whatsnew/n38/distinctfieldvalues02.png");
2013-01-03 18:15:05	supersym	    background-repeat: no-repeat;
2013-01-03 18:15:05	supersym	    display: block;
2013-01-03 18:15:05	supersym	    height: 300px;
2013-01-03 18:15:05	supersym	    margin: 3px;
2013-01-03 18:15:05	supersym	    width: 500px;
2013-01-03 18:15:05	supersym	}
2013-01-03 18:15:33	supersym	no run-time computed styles manipulation/interception or injection :P
2013-01-03 18:15:38	supersym	nothing fancy 
2013-01-03 18:16:03	flatour	ok and if the actual image is only 200px width?
2013-01-03 18:16:09	flatour	how will it display?
2013-01-03 18:16:16	supersym	not really no because you are bound to the HTML and DOM entities and abstractions of those
2013-01-03 18:16:35	supersym	but ofc you can write a subset of html like [bbcode][/bbcode] does
2013-01-03 18:17:51	supersym	200px unless you resize it
2013-01-03 18:18:09	supersym	failin to provide a size will make it 1x1 first
2013-01-03 18:18:24	supersym	and then expand to it's real size as the img src gets loaded in
2013-01-03 18:18:43	supersym	meaning before the domReady event
2013-01-03 18:19:09	supersym	but if its slow to load...you might get distorted divs etc for a short time
2013-01-03 18:19:13	supersym	unless the imgs are loaded
2013-01-03 18:19:29	supersym	so you normally want to give the proper sizes or have a tool for that
2013-01-03 18:19:33	supersym	i recently saw one
2013-01-03 18:19:36	supersym	lemme check
2013-01-03 18:20:34	supersym	http://placehold.it/
2013-01-03 18:20:53	supersym	http://placekitten.com/
2013-01-03 18:20:56	supersym	awww
2013-01-03 18:21:17	supersym	you might be able to use that?
2013-01-03 18:22:33	supersym	anyway to make your own tags, i'm afraid,  is out of your league
2013-01-03 18:22:52	flatour	I wrote the html for the web page ... but if you add some effect or surrounding that's really difficult to keep with a fixed width
2013-01-03 18:22:57	supersym	nothing that makes it really easy, language is complicated and you need to define syntactic rulesets
2013-01-03 18:23:16	supersym	or derive from existing logic/prototypes
2013-01-03 18:23:42	supersym	i guess everything is still DOM elements and values at the core
2013-01-03 18:24:57	flatour	I have the feeling I'm not explaining myself very well :)
2013-01-03 18:24:59	supersym	div, position and display block/inline elements i found one of the hardest things to learn
2013-01-03 18:25:47	supersym	all i can say is try, try, try at e.g. jsbin.org which also renders live just smaller scale and in browser not like docpad
2013-01-03 18:28:13	supersym	also check website source code in your browser / firebug often
2013-01-03 18:28:38	supersym	and just copy/paste html/css/js snippets inside jsbin.org or jsfiddle.com, codepen.io and such
2013-01-03 18:28:57	supersym	so you can tweak to the max and see how the elements/styles get applied
2013-01-03 18:29:47	supersym	because thats the only way to learn and so much essential of how a document flow works + positioning of elements etc
2013-01-03 18:30:04	supersym	http://tredius.nl/
2013-01-03 18:30:19	supersym	that was my first site in docpad a few weeks ago
2013-01-03 18:31:31	supersym	its got a lot of positioning and flow stuff in its styles.. note that I used a semantic grid here to render 12 columns for me at max width 960px
2013-01-03 18:31:38	supersym	or 940px
2013-01-03 18:32:15	supersym	firefox has the awesome https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/tilt/
2013-01-03 18:32:50	flatour	ok let's forget the previous discussion about images :). However, in any cases ... the way docpad is working makes it an opportunity to bring some image handling in the loop... for instance, I may want to generate thumbnails...
2013-01-03 18:32:51	supersym	and most browser by now have, when you point at a element in html source in the browser, inside the web page its visual representation lights up
2013-01-03 18:33:19	supersym	let me show you how i'd do that with its current infra
2013-01-03 18:35:05	supersym	https://github.com/docpad/docpad-plugin-associatedfiles
2013-01-03 18:35:48	supersym	set the thumbnails to fixed width size and handle the onclick event or such to zoom in (using your lightbox or jquery)
2013-01-03 18:37:30	supersym	so you set inside your document meta-data associatedFilesDirectory: /this/is/my/path (or not and use the basename)
2013-01-03 18:37:55	flatour	ok that's some idea ... will explore this...
2013-01-03 18:38:19	supersym	then inside the document body create the loop using getAssociatedFiles() method which in turns looks up the meta-data path or uses the basename
2013-01-03 18:39:14	flatour	let me come back on the parsing side of things because it was a bit confusing ... 
2013-01-03 18:39:27	supersym	yeah - docpad meta-data is really a very nice and elegant solution to many common problems :P
2013-01-03 18:39:34	supersym	ok
2013-01-03 18:39:52	supersym	it is... i had to check the source + documents often
2013-01-03 18:40:04	supersym	its not always clear and so might i not be :P
2013-01-03 18:41:58	-->	zenorocha (~zenorocha@189.60.171.47) has joined #docpad
2013-01-03 18:45:15	flatour	Am I correct to think I could hook up into renderdocument event and use some regex processing in order to get into my own transformation helper...
2013-01-03 18:46:19	flatour	is that the proper approach? or would it be better to extend specific renderer plugin and use their own extension mechanism when it exists...
2013-01-03 18:47:02	supersym	well yes...i think so. but some renderers will not like unknown keywords
2013-01-03 18:47:10	supersym	others might be more tolerant
2013-01-03 18:47:18	supersym	the browser itself usually doesnt care too much
2013-01-03 18:47:40	supersym	and with XML/XHTML i think you may even define/name any element beside it's doctype :P
2013-01-03 18:48:13	supersym	so its really a question of that specific rendering engine, like jade or the coffeescript compiler
2013-01-03 18:48:18	supersym	on how they deal with that
2013-01-03 18:48:31	supersym	unless you even hook in before they jump in
2013-01-03 18:49:01	supersym	fetch your custom tags...render -> proper html (escaped!) or jade, or coffee...and then have them render -> proper html
2013-01-03 18:49:12	flatour	for markdown, for instance, it may be the easy teenage transform version :)
2013-01-03 18:49:34	supersym	yeah i think the { } symbols for example arent used right>
2013-01-03 18:50:56	supersym	i just found this one, it seems a bit like a simple docpad like utility
2013-01-03 18:50:59	supersym	http://laktek.github.com/punch/
2013-01-03 18:52:23	flatour	Don't you use this yourself for making things simpler... sometimes for simplifying things like that:
2013-01-03 18:52:33	flatour	div class=box
2013-01-03 18:52:43	supersym	Write minimal templates with Mustache. - I think that is probably the best clean way

2013-01-03 18:53:42	supersym	i do that when i use jade, stylus and other shorthand tricks
2013-01-03 18:53:46	flatour	I forgot, I can use partials for that no?
2013-01-03 18:54:04	supersym	you can use partials if you have data to go along
2013-01-03 18:54:06	supersym	yes
2013-01-03 18:55:01	supersym	partial('my-partial-file-at-src-partials', { 'data': this, 'name': 'fun' })
2013-01-03 18:55:21	supersym	notice you can pass the context from document -> partial like that :)
2013-01-03 18:55:58	flatour	but can I use partials within markdown?
2013-01-03 18:57:35	supersym	hmm yes i'd say so.. you need to escape it like regular html i guess
2013-01-03 18:57:53	supersym	thats why I also like most of Jade syntax
2013-01-03 18:58:16	supersym	I can just have blocks of :markdown and jade through eachother
2013-01-03 18:58:34	supersym	so i fall back to markdown inside the .html.jade file when there is a lot of text
2013-01-03 18:58:48	supersym	most times i didnt go further than h1, h2 and p tags :P
2013-01-03 19:00:41	flatour	Do you mean, jade is able to process markdown?
2013-01-03 19:00:47	supersym	sec
2013-01-03 19:03:36	supersym	ok doesnt work in jsbin :P
2013-01-03 19:04:13	supersym	but try it.. .ajhttp://scalate.fusesource.org/documentation/jade-syntax.html#filters
2013-01-03 19:05:52	supersym	also if you place a period adjactent to a proper element like say p. or pre.
2013-01-03 19:06:15	supersym	all the lines below which are idented may be written as plain text strings
2013-01-03 19:06:23	supersym	without the | prefix
2013-01-03 19:06:33	supersym	its really quite clean
2013-01-03 19:06:47	supersym	only thing thats not elegant is line br
2013-01-03 19:07:08	supersym	either br on each line, or use | <br /> <br />
2013-01-03 19:07:30	-->	zenorocha (~zenorocha@189.60.171.47) has joined #docpad
2013-01-03 19:07:40	supersym	but nowadays you'd rather set margin/padding/lineheight in CSS to create distance between two things
2013-01-03 19:08:11	supersym	lol if you take away the stylesheet at my site
2013-01-03 19:08:28	supersym	it collapses back to nearly a plain text file in courier :P
2013-01-03 19:08:46	supersym	*everything* that is style should be made up in the cascading sheets 
2013-01-03 19:09:03	flatour	do you mean, I can write somefile.html.jade in docpad and that my document can contain some markdown: formatted text that will be properly handled by jade renderer?
2013-01-03 19:10:16	supersym	yup
2013-01-03 19:10:34	supersym	as long as you installed a valid markdown for :markdown rendering
2013-01-03 19:11:44	supersym	as for :stylus and :coffee-script which substitute 'script' and 'link' css/js for their shorthand cousins
2013-01-03 19:12:10	supersym	have your cake and eat it too ^^
2013-01-03 19:12:50	flatour	is this something inherent to jade or is this that docpad plugin is using jade extension mechanism for hooking up an existing markdown engine ?
2013-01-03 19:13:34	flatour	seems you answered my question
2013-01-03 19:14:19	flatour	I suppose I need to configure the jade plugin so that it uses a markdown engine...
2013-01-03 19:14:55	supersym	no its jade
2013-01-03 19:14:55	supersym	yeah
2013-01-03 19:15:02	supersym	not really
2013-01-03 19:15:10	supersym	just 'npm i marked' will do
2013-01-03 19:15:30	supersym	'npm i marked stylus coffee-script jade' for them all
2013-01-03 19:15:41	supersym	and 'html2jade' for rendering to html
2013-01-03 19:15:57	supersym	that is
2013-01-03 19:16:25	supersym	npm i docpad-plugin-{marked,jade,stylus,coffee-script,html2jade}
2013-01-03 19:16:34	supersym	will do the trick in bash shell
2013-01-03 19:16:50	flatour	and why would you use jade over haml?
2013-01-03 19:17:00	supersym	drops the %
2013-01-03 19:17:19	supersym	less typing and cleaner syntax
2013-01-03 19:17:43	supersym	they call jade the haml killer
2013-01-03 19:17:45	supersym	lol
2013-01-03 19:18:31	supersym	jade appearantly is designed as a successor of haml specifically
2013-01-03 19:19:10	supersym	http://vschart.com/compare/jade-template-engin/vs/haml
2013-01-03 19:20:08	flatour	so in order to introduce some shortcut (for design stuff), I maybe best going with jade ... and use a combination of partials call and markdown when it's about text ... I'll check this approach
2013-01-03 19:20:39	supersym	well...thats half the story, my story anyway
2013-01-03 19:21:00	supersym	because most ppl here use coffeekup/script for html doc rendering as well as code
2013-01-03 19:21:09	supersym	and most examples are in eco
2013-01-03 19:21:25	supersym	jade in docpad has specific corner cases
2013-01-03 19:21:29	supersym	more so than eco
2013-01-03 19:22:03	supersym	so look at it from a support perspective as well
2013-01-03 19:22:33	supersym	since i dont always type this much for everyone, others might and prolly will not know if it's very specifically about jade
2013-01-03 19:22:33	flatour	the comparison page doesn't seem very ...hum ... serious ... 
2013-01-03 19:23:04	supersym	nah ...its a joke :
2013-01-03 19:23:26	flatour	The first time I heard of coffeekup is when reading about docpad a few days ago ... is it used widely?
2013-01-03 19:26:05	supersym	no not so much... i did a poll on linkedin front-end developers group
2013-01-03 19:26:16	supersym	not many like it as much as we here seem to
2013-01-03 19:27:17	supersym	maybe its our preference for elegant and simple things that brings us together :P
2013-01-03 19:27:26	supersym	trust me... the rest will follow later
2013-01-03 19:27:42	supersym	already more and more development teams work in cs or ics even
2013-01-03 19:28:04	supersym	thats why ppl started raising money to fund a new coffee-script compiler
2013-01-03 19:28:18	supersym	http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/michaelficarra/make-a-better-coffeescript-compiler
2013-01-03 19:28:31	supersym	$13,785 pledged :)
2013-01-03 19:32:09	supersym	As Brian Kernighan once observed, “Controlling complexity is the essence of computer programming”
2013-01-03 19:32:18	supersym	Debugging dominates development time, and getting a working system out the door is usually less a result of brilliant design than it is of managing not to trip over your own feet too many times.
2013-01-03 19:34:43	flatour	but debugging with CS is not necessarily the most exciting thing ... as far as I understood, source map generation (in order to debug at the CS source level) was only done recently ...
2013-01-03 19:36:15	supersym	no not that but I can tell you if you use Jade in docpad without prior experience, you'll end up with a few really weird things that you cant google always
2013-01-03 19:36:39	supersym	even getCollection().toJSON() appearantly not always works...
2013-01-03 19:36:48	supersym	and Jade is a bitch with multiline code
2013-01-03 19:37:01	supersym	and how to use - or != or =
2013-01-03 19:37:07	supersym	@ and :
2013-01-03 19:37:16	supersym	they can be hairy
2013-01-03 19:38:28	supersym	also stylus will take like a day before you really get used to the indention if you use it
2013-01-03 19:39:00	supersym	you really need a good text editor to help you with the significant white-space
2013-01-03 19:39:19	supersym	especially when the chain becomes longer in stylus, it's harder to read
2013-01-03 19:39:44	supersym	and to misalign some properties
2013-01-03 19:39:54	supersym	= rendering error
2013-01-03 19:40:04	supersym	when you save and have livereload on
2013-01-03 19:40:26	supersym	luckily, so you'll have a near exact point where to look :P
2013-01-03 19:40:56	supersym	 because the source code gets rendered asynchronously...its not always accurate with line nrs
2013-01-03 19:41:16	supersym	so you need to be accurate as in not to mix spaces/tabs either
2013-01-03 19:41:47	flatour	I'm a bit confused now ... are you recommending not to use jade within docpad ?
2013-01-03 19:42:16	supersym	big tradeoff is you loose a lot of copy/paste options from the web...need to html2jade and js2coffee stuff first :P
2013-01-03 19:42:30	supersym	but you trim down Lines of Code like a MTF
2013-01-03 19:50:24	flatour	maybe haml is less prone to error by using %
2013-01-03 19:51:24	supersym	nah
2013-01-03 19:51:41	-->	woah (~smuxi@c-67-169-92-180.hsd1.ca.comcast.net) has joined #docpad
2013-01-03 19:51:42	supersym	jade rules on elements are quite unambiguous
2013-01-03 19:52:30	supersym	#identifier, default div ; .class also default div, treat the rest as elements except for filters starting with :
2013-01-03 19:52:41	supersym	thats the only options you have
2013-01-03 19:53:41	supersym	but if you like to use { } like in moustache
2013-01-03 19:53:57	supersym	or as in js #{like.this}
2013-01-03 19:54:21	supersym	then haml is less clear/more error prone to overlooking perhaps a { or }???
2013-01-03 19:54:23	supersym	i dunno
2013-01-03 19:59:12	flatour	ok, I have to test a few things now :)

2013-01-03 22:12:13	campino2k	one question: how can i render a static version which I can deploy in subdirectories?
2013-01-03 22:12:35	supersym	docpad generate --static
2013-01-03 22:13:46	campino2k	supersym: "unknown option '--static'
2013-01-03 22:14:26	campino2k	if you meant docpad generate --env static: i did
2013-01-03 22:14:39	supersym	yup
2013-01-03 22:14:42	supersym	sorry :P
2013-01-03 22:15:55	campino2k	but the problem is: i have used the menu generation snippet from the documentation
2013-01-03 22:16:22	campino2k	which uses "page.url"
2013-01-03 22:17:26	supersym	that should still remain static routes tho
2013-01-03 22:17:28	campino2k	but the links are generated absolutely
2013-01-03 22:17:33	supersym	right
2013-01-03 22:17:59	campino2k	which is bad when I want the page to be a subdir of some other site
2013-01-03 22:20:21	supersym	you used dp-plugin-menus right?
2013-01-03 22:21:25	campino2k	i used the one here: http://docpad.org/docs/begin
2013-01-03 22:23:58	supersym	relativeOutDirPath
2013-01-03 22:24:07	supersym	no
2013-01-03 22:24:33	campino2k	this will lbreak in subdirs
2013-01-03 22:25:21	supersym	anyway
2013-01-03 22:25:34	supersym	you can use indexes to reach the truncated parts of urls
2013-01-03 22:26:08	supersym	its something like getDocument().getCollection().toJSON().url[0] or urls[0] and then try 1 and 2
2013-01-03 22:26:32	supersym	depending on the extensions a file has etc some of these will be populated if I remember correctly
2013-01-03 22:26:39	supersym	see if it contains the path you want

2013-01-03 22:27:47	supersym	It can be a comma seperated values list, or an array of values.
2013-01-03 22:28:59	supersym	ID
2013-01-03 22:28:59	supersym	The unique document indentifier. Defaults to the cid. When we get the relativePath, we set the id to that instead.

2013-01-04 00:51:06	supersym	it should really do so
2013-01-04 00:51:36	supersym	where does it get placed in out/ ?
2013-01-04 00:54:26	sberryman	good question, let me take alook
2013-01-04 00:54:46	sberryman	is it safe to delete everything in out?
2013-01-04 00:55:41	sberryman	that is all it took.. wiped out everything in the out directory and started docpad back up
2013-01-04 00:55:58	sberryman	figured would work like that out of the box, everything else is so damn easy

2013-01-04 01:09:59	supersym	it should
2013-01-04 01:10:10	supersym	but sometimes something can go wrong during rendering
2013-01-04 01:10:38	supersym	e.g. stylus rendering error that perhaps is non-fatal but data still comes out garbled
2013-01-04 01:10:54	supersym	sometimes you also may get cached objects when you don't want them...
2013-01-04 01:11:15	supersym	but you can version-name those to reset that
2013-01-04 01:11:42	supersym	this you'll have to notice and issue docpad clean && docpad generate indeed :O
2013-01-04 01:13:26	supersym	as its unable to detect and respond to these anomalies, because we leave the node.js error and stackdump stuff in tact

2013-01-04 01:49:11	supersym	try docpad.getCollection('files').toJSON() ?
2013-01-04 01:50:41	flatour	is the following supposed to work: each item in docpad.getCollection('html').findAll({tags: {$has: ['whatsnew']}, versionMajor: document.versionMajor, versionMinor: document.versionMinor}, [versionBuild:1]).toJSON()
2013-01-04 01:51:49	flatour	this works with eco:                     <% for item in @getCollection('html').findAll({tags: {$has: ['whatsnew']}, versionMajor: @document.versionMajor, versionMinor: @document.versionMinor}, [versionBuild:1]).toJSON(): %> 
2013-01-04 01:52:22	flatour	basically, how do I translate this into jade?
2013-01-04 01:53:30	supersym	did you use - each...?
2013-01-04 01:53:37	supersym	the minus symbol?
2013-01-04 01:53:44	supersym	is used for iterations
2013-01-04 01:54:54	flatour	yes, I tried as well ... does it need to be at a specific indentation level?
2013-01-04 01:54:59	supersym	you must anyway, choose the correct Jade buffering technique in different scenatios.. != getBlock() is also used and p= #{data} in those cases
2013-01-04 01:56:10	flatour	what seems weird is that there isn't even one unit test involving such a function call

2013-01-04 01:58:25	supersym	nearly all is made in markdown, jade and stylus

2013-01-04 02:02:19	supersym	let me cook up something
2013-01-04 02:04:39	flatour	have a good sleep ... will try an tweak to get jade working
2013-01-04 02:05:14	flatour	by the way :markup does not work ... there must be something to configure in docpad.coffee
2013-01-04 02:05:20	supersym	for item in docpad.getCollection('files').toJSON()
2013-01-04 02:05:20	supersym	  p= item.url
2013-01-04 02:05:32	supersym	that renders a list of file names...
2013-01-04 02:10:27	supersym	.findAll({isPage:true}).toJSON()
2013-01-04 02:10:41	supersym	you append that in betweem
2013-01-04 02:10:51	supersym	had to look for a bit, examples are sparse
2013-01-04 02:11:13	flatour	got it to work :)
2013-01-04 02:11:15	supersym	so dont use the each keyword... i had troubles with that earlier as well i remember
2013-01-04 02:11:20	supersym	goodie :)
2013-01-04 02:12:27	flatour	do you know how I can configure the :markdown thing?
2013-01-04 02:13:11	flatour	Is there some kind of standard for passing configuration data from docpad.coffee?
2013-01-04 02:13:54	supersym	not besides the way node exposes its public methods and properties in any module (file)
2013-01-04 02:14:30	supersym	as module.exports ... thats what becomes available in public docpad instance scope
2013-01-04 02:14:43	supersym	and is accessible by the documents as well as layouts
2013-01-04 02:15:23	supersym	e.g. getTitle() helper for HTML document title is used in default
2013-01-04 02:15:35	supersym	but could just as well have been called anywhere else
2013-01-04 02:15:45	supersym	anyway i really gotta go now...

2013-01-04 06:20:34	ashnur	kewl
2013-01-04 06:20:45	ashnur	i had no idea that was not there until now ;)
2013-01-04 06:20:59	ashnur	maybe because I've not used the static env
2013-01-04 06:21:47	ashnur	balupton: do you have some toolkit to deal with asynchronicity? Or just plain callbacks?
2013-01-04 06:22:04	ashnur	maybe something in bal-util? :)

2013-01-04 06:49:11	balupton	so you create a group with a completion callback, then just add tasks to it, and tell it how it should run

2013-01-04 07:11:16	ashnur	i am having trouble writing async code
2013-01-04 07:11:40	ashnur	so i decided i will try out almost everyhting i can find, and watch videos and learn stuff
2013-01-04 07:12:07	ashnur	then write code, i know what I have trouble with, so I will try out everything which seems promising
2013-01-04 07:12:15	ashnur	and after that i will know what to use

2013-01-04 19:34:05	supersym	I have been evaluating some document generators now... Codo is inspired by JSDoc which generates a reference manual of your code entities, based upon tags in the code comments to enrich them for distillation by the tool
2013-01-04 19:34:59	supersym	But I am also very charmed by the literate-programming tools like Docco
2013-01-04 19:36:08	supersym	One is from a programming language classification perspective, you could view it from OOP or the recent node.js more suitable perhaps, the approach of mixin, components and imports.
2013-01-04 19:36:28	supersym	I am tempted to conclude in this early stage that:
2013-01-04 19:37:01	supersym	- both serve their purpose depending on what you want to do with the code: learn the intent of everything, or the mechanics
2013-01-04 19:37:52	supersym	- every single tool has a few things that it should improve on, but in the end nothing is stopping anyone from hacking in some extra @tags for the document generator (those @ placed in the comments)
2013-01-04 19:37:58	-->	woah (~smuxi@216-75-227-234.static.wiline.com) has joined #docpad
2013-01-04 19:38:11	supersym	But it's a contradiction to really do both
2013-01-04 19:38:50	supersym	Literate approach we'd provide a good comment block right above the method block and treat it as one...
2013-01-04 19:39:16	supersym	The OOP approach you might want to split out different options of the methods parameters and return objects
2013-01-04 19:40:34	supersym	I think to do both, you would mess up the final result too muck from @params -> literate would ruin a document like http://btd.github.com/docco/examples/backbone.js.html (as an example of literate)
2013-01-04 19:41:46	supersym	I've seem to caught up with industry techniques tho ,... why do I always have to think 'can't I have both?'
2013-01-04 19:42:06	supersym	I really don't feel like replacing comment blocks in a huge code base
2013-01-04 19:42:18	supersym	I guess most will choose one depending on the intent
2013-01-04 19:46:06	-->	Natetronn (~Natetronn@189.220.25.43.cable.dyn.cableonline.com.mx) has joined #docpad
2013-01-04 19:47:29	supersym	While docco is tiny, 100 lines, it doesn't support stuff like generate from directory (though cli bash/zsh {...} parameter expansion works fine)
2013-01-04 19:47:46	Natetronn	that moment when you first try something new and there is an error during the quick start and you don't know if you should forget the whole thing or go looking for help :)
2013-01-04 19:48:01	Natetronn	now would be that moment for me
2013-01-04 19:49:36	supersym	it also doesn't support all kinds of languages I think.. and it's written in javascript. Its intended improved version docco-next is early fork but intended to improve certain things .. so might in the end be a better candidate if we have to choose 1 over others to offer as dp-plugin - more open to beginners that is and easier to apply on any language specifically, it's also written in coffeescript to keep
2013-01-04 19:49:36	supersym	our src uniform cs as much as possible
2013-01-04 19:49:46	supersym	I see
2013-01-04 19:49:49	supersym	haha

2013-01-04 19:50:02	supersym	good for you usually someone here who wants to help :)
2013-01-04 19:50:28	supersym	sometimes errors in software or documentation can be critical turning points
2013-01-04 19:50:33	supersym	what is your problem?
2013-01-04 19:52:24	Natetronn	I'm thinking it's probably an easy fix though, the first line says this: Error: Cannot find module 'socket.io' after I run sudo docpad run
2013-01-04 19:52:58	supersym	First of all, I suggest you drop the sudo
2013-01-04 19:53:16	supersym	have node.js sit in a global directory you can access without using the root account
2013-01-04 19:53:19	Natetronn	I think I was getting more errors without it (let me check)
2013-01-04 19:53:27	supersym	yeah you will
2013-01-04 19:53:35	Natetronn	ok
2013-01-04 19:54:01	Natetronn	actually just the one error without sudo
2013-01-04 19:54:05	supersym	what is you distro?
2013-01-04 19:54:41	supersym	anyway not vital here but very good practice
2013-01-04 19:55:02	supersym	set the group id or just have a group with write access you can use
2013-01-04 19:55:24	supersym	and then set the # Node package itself
2013-01-04 19:55:24	supersym	export NODE_PATH="/usr/local/lib/node"
2013-01-04 19:55:42	supersym	# Node modules install paths
2013-01-04 19:55:42	supersym	# Do not rely on globals, local modules are more trustworthy and faster.
2013-01-04 19:55:42	supersym	export NODE_DIR="${HOME}/node_modules:/usr/local/lib"
2013-01-04 19:55:46	supersym	something like that
2013-01-04 19:55:57	supersym	now for your problem with socket.io
2013-01-04 19:56:47	supersym	you need to ensure to have the getBlock('scripts') in your src/layout
2013-01-04 19:57:16	supersym	default.html.eco file or something
2013-01-04 19:57:39	supersym	socket.io will be installed somewhere in your global node.js path tho
2013-01-04 19:57:46	supersym	if i remember correctly
2013-01-04 19:58:19	supersym	cause you hook up to the hardware layers, you would need to have proper unix permissions on it's location
2013-01-04 19:59:53	supersym	the getBlock is important because docpad plugins hook onto it so they may script parts of the framework without having a user put script blocks in the default.html.eco file
2013-01-04 20:00:44	supersym	also ensure you have every node.js package installed like after using a skeleton, explicitly do 'npm i' to pull in all referenced dependencies etc
2013-01-04 20:00:51	supersym	if you've done all that
2013-01-04 20:00:54	supersym	it should work
2013-01-04 20:00:57	supersym	without a doubt
2013-01-04 20:01:37	supersym	so you can use command 'docpad' installed in the global directory, ensure socket.io there too
2013-01-04 20:02:06	supersym	the rest, all plugins, all additional packages not being used from the cli as standalone program, they do in a local folder
2013-01-04 20:02:11	supersym	do=go
2013-01-04 20:03:33	Natetronn	(thanks supersym, I'm trying to figure out your suggestions now)
2013-01-04 20:04:38	supersym	let me know if you have any questions, would help to know your platform, OS, docpad version and environment variables if you get stuck
2013-01-04 20:06:32	Natetronn	MAC OS 10.8.2, docpad 6.21
2013-01-04 20:07:18	supersym	aha
2013-01-04 20:08:02	supersym	ok anyway you will get a notice by docpad when there is a new version, then do 'npm i -g docpad' again to use the new version
2013-01-04 20:08:29	supersym	so if you don't, you know its current :P
2013-01-04 20:08:46	supersym	I don't know mac but it uses bash anyway
2013-01-04 20:09:08	supersym	so put the env var in ~/.bashrc
2013-01-04 20:21:29	Natetronn	supersym I think I got it
2013-01-04 20:23:24	Natetronn	I think all I needed to do was pull in the dependencies
2013-01-04 20:31:26	supersym	cool
2013-01-04 20:34:18	Natetronn	thanks

2013-01-04 21:27:27	supersym	I am writing out some thoughts on how we could structure those parts in relation to docpad
2013-01-04 21:28:56	supersym	also currently I just bundle that under a personal project docpad-plugin-classroom
2013-01-04 21:29:35	supersym	because I feel all those efforts, it's intent, ultimately should be aimed at unlocking, or making accessible, of information for end-users
2013-01-04 21:29:46	supersym	from newbie -> more expert
2013-01-04 21:30:34	supersym	but that might be a big workload all together, later i also want to work more with interactive learning tools, and document generation is intended for humans and learning / reference
2013-01-04 21:30:41	supersym	so it would fit nicely together
2013-01-04 21:32:00	supersym	also a browserbased cli with intellisense and contextual tooltips would all fit into this category from that perspective that its intent is to visually aid (help, learn, remember, reference)
2013-01-04 21:33:23	supersym	mashing-up enough currently available quality tools like that would eventually lead, with some right choices, to a browser based development IDE tailor made and with automatic interactive help
2013-01-04 21:35:05	supersym	thats what I love about FOSS is that you have a 1000 pax development team co-working on 'modules' you can use in your own program... so if their logic is excellent, their code uncomplicated and suitable, you'd be able to click it into your super-project and never break a sweat ;)

2013-01-05 02:18:02	sethlesky	On twitter-bootstrap.(jade).docpad when the browser width shrinks under 970 a 60px gap appears above the navbar. Should user style.css come between bootstrap.css and bootstrap-responsive.css in order to avoid this? https://github.com/docpad/twitter-bootstrap-jade.docpad/blob/master/src/layouts/default.html.jade#L11-L20

2013-01-05 05:06:11	flatour	when using markdown with jade I got the following error: Cannot find markdown library, install markdown, discount or marked... Does anybody know how to make jade aware of default docpad (marked) markdown engine?
2013-01-05 05:07:51	ashnur	?
2013-01-05 05:08:12	ashnur	what is the extension you use?
2013-01-05 05:08:16	ashnur	for your files?
2013-01-05 05:08:55	flatour	jade lets you use ":markdown" filter
2013-01-05 05:09:28	flatour	that makes it possible to write some markdown inside a jade template file
2013-01-05 05:09:47	flatour	was that your question?
2013-01-05 05:09:59	ashnur	no. it wasn't.
2013-01-05 05:10:09	ashnur	and I don't use jade
2013-01-05 05:10:12	ashnur	so I don't know
2013-01-05 05:10:26	ashnur	all I know that I can do filename.html.md.eco and it works
2013-01-05 05:10:37	ashnur	for eco
2013-01-05 05:10:42	ashnur	for jade, you figure it out
2013-01-05 05:12:13	flatour	my extension is html.jade
2013-01-05 05:12:57	flatour	I don't need an intermediate format as jade makes it possible to embed markdown syntax through filter...
2013-01-05 05:13:39	flatour	however, when using this filter I get the error specified in my first post
2013-01-05 05:13:47	flatour	hopefully I clarified
2013-01-05 05:15:52	flatour	here is how it look like: https://github.com/visionmedia/jade#filters
2013-01-05 05:16:57	ashnur	i don't care about jade, want no to use it.
2013-01-05 05:19:54	flatour	you sound like a nice guy :)
2013-01-05 05:25:14	balupton	flatour: the only way to make jade use docpad's things, is to install the text plugin, then output the following html: <text render="markdown"># your markdown</text>
2013-01-05 05:25:31	balupton	using filters like :markdown are handled by jade, and not by docpad
2013-01-05 05:25:47	balupton	the text plugin on the other hand, uses docpad's rendering engine
2013-01-05 05:26:00	balupton	I'll add this to the FAQ as it is a really common question
2013-01-05 05:26:25	balupton	actually, can you ask it on stack overflow, and then I'll answer
2013-01-05 05:27:44	flatour	I must be missing something here... I suppose the jade plugin is a kind of glue thing between jade and docpad... am I wrong?
2013-01-05 05:28:20	ashnur	i don't know, i never ever used jade, dunno what it does
2013-01-05 05:28:22	flatour	you are not parsing jade yourself in docpad but are using jade engine
2013-01-05 05:28:41	ashnur	but it's open source, you can see it online
2013-01-05 05:29:12	flatour	In that respect, why jade engine would not be able to use filter syntax for markdown?
2013-01-05 05:29:45	ashnur	no, in that respect why don't you go at the plugin's page, and check it? :)
2013-01-05 05:30:27	flatour	ashnur, can you please shut up?
2013-01-05 05:31:21	flatour	I was answering balupton ... ok maybe I forgot to write "balupton:" but considering you don't care about jade, I'm not sure why you would think I'm talking to you...
2013-01-05 05:32:58	ashnur	flatour: sry :)

2013-01-05 05:34:01	balupton	https://github.com/bevry/docpad-documentation/blob/master/01-start/faq.html.md#how-can-i-get-jade-handlebars-whatever-to-render-markdown-coffeescript-eco-whatever
2013-01-05 05:34:47	balupton	the jade plugin renders jade templates, however the jade filters are defined by jade, not us
2013-01-05 05:36:29	balupton	we could change the jade plugin to override the built in filters, and add the other filters for the other markups, however that would be cumbersome.
2013-01-05 05:38:35	flatour	I was thinking there was certainly some way to make jade engine aware of the markdown engine used by docpad ...
2013-01-05 05:39:03	ashnur	:(
2013-01-05 05:39:45	ashnur	look flatour, I don't want to annoy you or anything, but why you not like the easy way? :)
2013-01-05 05:40:05	flatour	I don't know how jade is checking for markdown engine availability but I was supposing it was some generic approach...
2013-01-05 05:40:48	ashnur	:(
2013-01-05 05:40:51	flatour	ashnur ... I am just trying to understand 
2013-01-05 05:40:58	ashnur	ok
2013-01-05 05:41:04	ashnur	than i will shut up :-|
2013-01-05 05:42:12	balupton	we can add a filter like: :docpadRender(render="markdown")
2013-01-05 05:44:31	flatour	just installed the text plugin ... but how am I supposed to use it in the context of a jade template?
2013-01-05 05:44:52	flatour	just tried <text></text>
2013-01-05 05:50:55	flatour	<text render="markdown"> works more or less in a jade context but a bit tricky with indentation ... I have to make a few tests and see if I can come up with a reasonable approach...
2013-01-05 05:52:08	ashnur	:)
2013-01-05 05:54:16	flatour	ok found a rather clean approach:
2013-01-05 05:55:06	flatour	div.
2013-01-05 05:55:21	flatour	    <text render="markdown">
2013-01-05 05:56:00	ashnur	i like the docpad method more
2013-01-05 05:56:05	flatour	    ## New features
2013-01-05 05:56:31	flatour	    some *other* markdown
2013-01-05 05:56:45	flatour	    </text>
2013-01-05 05:57:07	flatour	The trick is to have a "." after the "div" element...
2013-01-05 05:58:05	ashnur	yeah, the trick for me was to have the .md in the extension.
2013-01-05 05:58:20	ashnur	but i guess your method works too
2013-01-05 06:01:33	flatour	balupton: thanks for your help ... I will certainly write a few blog articles describing my journey with docpad while trying to rewrite www.enesyssoftware.com...
2013-01-05 06:01:42	ashnur	now, what I want is that when the markdown plugin does it's job and find's a ``` in my template, to replace it not with <pre><code> but <pre><code attributes>. some transformer code maybe?
2013-01-05 06:03:23	flatour	what kind of attributes... the language?
2013-01-05 06:03:39	ashnur	yes, possibly

2013-01-05 06:08:37	flatour	I'm rather new to docpad so am not necessary the best advisor... but if you need a systematic approach, you could certainly use renderdocument event to make a global replace on code elements ...
2013-01-05 06:10:55	flatour	it seems that this is what the pygment plugin is doing ... so that it should not be difficult to mimic/copy ...
2013-01-05 06:11:10	ashnur	now, i am approaching this from the wrong angle
2013-01-05 06:11:35	flatour	anyway, I have to go ... good luck and thanks again to balupton...
2013-01-05 06:16:20	ashnur	i don't get this highlightjs plugin. what's the point of the alternative language aliases?

2013-01-05 15:48:25	ashnur	apparently it believes that javascript is matlab or something
2013-01-05 15:49:20	ashnur	of course i could type out <pre><code class="javascript"></code></pre> but it's ugly :)
2013-01-05 15:50:25	ashnur	i am using prism now, but i might change back to highlight if it turns out that it has better highlight for javascript
2013-01-05 15:50:45	ashnur	the themes for prism aren't quite good, either too light or too dark
2013-01-05 15:51:01	ashnur	but in the meantime, I love docpad
2013-01-05 15:51:44	ashnur	i am embedding existing files as content into a markdown by using eco and this line: <%- @getFile({'name':'cbhell.js'}).toJSON().source %>
2013-01-05 15:51:57	ashnur	it will be a static site, so it's ok
2013-01-05 16:06:23	balupton	ashnur: what markup are you using for your code blocks?
2013-01-05 16:06:33	balupton	if you're using markdown you can do: ``` javascript
2013-01-05 16:07:41	balupton	if you want the rendered content, you can do: @include('cbhell.js') could be a bit faster
2013-01-05 16:13:31	ashnur	hmm
2013-01-05 16:13:45	ashnur	the js files are not documents
2013-01-05 16:13:55	ashnur	i will try highlightjs again
2013-01-05 16:14:09	ashnur	who wouldve' thought about that syntax, really :P
2013-01-05 16:27:22	ashnur	the include stuff did not work, but I haven't really tried, just how you wrote it and by relative path to src. it doesn't really matter, as It's just a static site for github pages
2013-01-05 16:31:44	ashnur	what is interesting that the highlighter works and puts all it's html tags in the markup, and the css file IS loaded, but while with the original and wrong mathlab style it had a lot of colors in it, now with js detection it has barely any colors
2013-01-05 16:31:47	ashnur	interesting

2013-01-06 14:02:39	majdi	Hi
2013-01-06 14:06:11	ashnur	hi
2013-01-06 14:11:07	majdi	Can I ask you a question about docpad? I have a little pb with unicode caracteres rendering :p
2013-01-06 14:11:22	ashnur	?
2013-01-06 14:12:26	majdi	I just write some article in french and there is some accents. But when in my browser I have for example "lÃ¢che!" instead of "lâche" and I don't know where is the pb
2013-01-06 14:13:21	ashnur	and your editor shows the correct character?
2013-01-06 14:13:35	majdi	yes
2013-01-06 14:13:43	ashnur	what editor that is?
2013-01-06 14:14:25	majdi	sublime text
2013-01-06 14:15:22	ashnur	2, i guess
2013-01-06 14:15:25	majdi	I can write the html code for each character like  &Aacute for à but there is for sure an other way :p
2013-01-06 14:15:26	majdi	yes
2013-01-06 14:15:47	ashnur	there are multiple reasons why this issue can happen
2013-01-06 14:16:00	ashnur	the first thing is to check that you are saving the files in utf8 format
2013-01-06 14:16:10	ashnur	you could do in whatever encoding of course, but this is best
2013-01-06 14:18:03	majdi	i just test it's the same pb
2013-01-06 14:18:32	ashnur	?
2013-01-06 14:18:48	ashnur	is your file's encoding utf8 or not?
2013-01-06 14:18:56	ashnur	do you know how to check it in your editor?
2013-01-06 14:19:30	majdi	yes in utf8, i solved the pb it's in my layout, i forgot: <meta charset="utf-8" />
2013-01-06 14:19:31	majdi	:p
2013-01-06 14:19:46	ashnur	that shouldn't be a problem
2013-01-06 14:19:59	ashnur	it means that your browser has a different default encoding
2013-01-06 14:20:48	majdi	ok
2013-01-06 14:21:55	majdi	hum well that's fix the pb, i'm going to try some different things. Thanks ashnur :)
2013-01-06 14:22:28	ashnur	np, you solved it, not me :)

2013-01-06 18:17:24	dustMason	good morning everyone. I'm trying to use the sunny plugin to upload my statically generated docpad site to AWS but it doesnt seem to doing anything. when I run `docpad generate` i just get the normal static compilation info messages
2013-01-06 18:17:34	dustMason	has anyone implemented the sunny plugin?
2013-01-06 18:18:43	ashnur	morning
2013-01-06 18:19:47	dustMason	hi
2013-01-06 18:19:55	ashnur	never heard of it :)
2013-01-06 18:20:05	dustMason	https://github.com/bobobo1618/docpad-plugin-sunny
2013-01-06 18:20:40	dustMason	does this ouptut mean that all of these plugins are indeed active? info: Plugins: coffeescript, eco, livereload, marked, partials, stylus, sunny, text
2013-01-06 18:23:19	ashnur	wow
2013-01-06 18:23:23	ashnur	this sounds kewl
2013-01-06 18:24:50	dustMason	yeah
2013-01-06 18:25:02	dustMason	i just cant seem to get it to perform the upload
2013-01-06 18:26:27	ashnur	the output you ask means that it is active
2013-01-06 18:26:44	ashnur	maybe there is a configuration issue
2013-01-06 18:27:36	dustMason	must be
2013-01-06 18:28:24	dustMason	https://gist.github.com/4468806
2013-01-06 18:28:38	dustMason	can you spot any glaring mistakes there?
2013-01-06 18:30:56	ashnur	well you need all the account stuff, but pls DO NOT put up those in a gist :)
2013-01-06 18:31:12	dustMason	haha yes of course. i have those stored in a .env file
2013-01-06 18:31:35	dustMason	i tried previously just including those in the config with the same results
2013-01-06 18:31:54	dustMason	looking at the plugin source, it should be giving me some messages in the console about trying to load config
2013-01-06 18:32:34	dustMason	for example, in this block: https://github.com/bobobo1618/docpad-plugin-sunny/blob/master/sunny.plugin.coffee#L133-L142
2013-01-06 18:34:31	dustMason	this is my shell output when i run docpad generate : https://gist.github.com/4468806#file-docpad-generate
2013-01-06 18:37:36	ashnur	dustMason: maybe because of the static environment? i am not sure :-S
2013-01-06 18:37:41	ashnur	I have never tried this :(
2013-01-06 18:37:54	ashnur	I would definitely write to the author and request help
2013-01-06 18:38:08	dustMason	thanks for the suggestion, i did try different envs with no luck
2013-01-06 18:38:18	dustMason	i will post an issue on GH

2013-01-09 17:17:00	zenorocha	sometimes it gets right

2013-01-09 17:21:29	ashnur	interesting
2013-01-09 17:22:45	zenorocha	yeah
2013-01-09 17:22:49	zenorocha	pretty weird

2013-01-09 17:23:53	supersym	hi btw :)
2013-01-09 17:44:38	ashnur	i can't use docpad on appfog
2013-01-09 17:44:43	ashnur	as the free limit is 100M
2013-01-09 17:44:51	ashnur	and the app is 115M 
2013-01-09 17:45:01	ashnur	and of course I would need some space for files
2013-01-09 17:45:43	ashnur	of course it shouldn't be this big
2013-01-09 17:45:50	ashnur	some of the plugins are really big
2013-01-09 17:47:07	ashnur	also, i really shouldn't upload the .git
2013-01-09 17:47:12	ashnur	dammit 
2013-01-09 17:47:30	supersym	that'll save some space for sure
2013-01-09 17:51:35	ashnur	also, it helps if you don't have the same project in your project in a subdirectory
2013-01-09 17:51:44	ashnur	appception
2013-01-09 17:51:53	ashnur	i know something wasn't right
2013-01-09 17:59:32	ashnur	i hate appfog
2013-01-09 17:59:39	ashnur	i liked it but it is such a struggle
2013-01-09 17:59:55	ashnur	i would love to know why my app isn't behaving the way i expect it
2013-01-09 18:00:02	ashnur	but there is not a clue about it
2013-01-09 18:11:44	supersym	i've never even heard about it
2013-01-09 18:12:00	supersym	so cant help you on that one im afraid

2013-01-09 21:29:51	ashnur	no, they are used in partials
2013-01-09 21:30:36	ashnur	although i guess you can use whatever you want whereever you like, but sometimes it might get tricky :D
2013-01-09 21:31:08	ashnur	but i use partials in the layout. actually i have one main partial and i load the rest of them in that

2013-01-11 14:53:36	supersym	anyone want to brainstorm a bit on how to integrate forms (validation,generation?) with docpad? thoughts?
2013-01-11 14:55:49	supersym	I would be tempted, since they can take up quite some space in terms of source code, besides to look for a existing nodejs solution, perhaps have something in terms of seperate .frm file extension for seperation of logic/template
2013-01-11 14:57:00	supersym	and include/feed data/code in the document much like a partial
2013-01-11 14:58:38	ashnur	i don't think there is a need for another content based filetype unless it significantly reduces the syntax to write that type of content
2013-01-11 14:58:45	ashnur	like with markdown > html
2013-01-11 14:58:57	ashnur	or coffee > js
2013-01-11 14:59:15	ashnur	templates are another thing, i do not like them at all
2013-01-11 14:59:50	ashnur	what I would do, or what I did once already to have the form in a separate partial
2013-01-11 15:00:09	ashnur	you might even write a custom plugin for it to, having everything in it :)
2013-01-11 15:02:29	supersym	yeah thats what i had in mind already to have that in a plugin -forms
2013-01-11 15:02:49	supersym	there are some nice nodejs solutions who tackle part of these problems
2013-01-11 15:02:59	supersym	some are very clean cut code
2013-01-11 15:03:16	supersym	bundle, wrap -> plugin 
2013-01-11 15:03:35	supersym	i tried to do that with several other themes as well, such as encryption etc
2013-01-11 15:04:03	supersym	to pick out the best stuff i could find, preferably in coffeescript, or convert, or just live with the js solution
2013-01-11 15:04:22	supersym	if the code base is large... MIT license all of them
2013-01-11 15:04:42	-->	shannonmoeller (~shannonmo@pool-98-117-169-55.bflony.fios.verizon.net) has joined #docpad
2013-01-11 15:05:03	supersym	i didnt spend much time in manually converting js->cs just automated anyway
2013-01-11 15:05:13	supersym	brb...groceries for the misses
2013-01-11 15:10:50	supersym	well the thing about forms that bug me, its lots of standard stuff but tons of markup
2013-01-11 15:11:13	supersym	esp if you want to have them semantic / accessible web 2.0 / RIA
2013-01-11 15:12:04	supersym	then again its always a question how far you want to go, with say client-side validation, how many different regex for standard fields you want to support out of the box
2013-01-11 15:12:52	supersym	but theres also a lot to automate easily, my previous project I just had it compare field names against a set of possible synonyms as well
2013-01-11 15:14:11	supersym	so it would trigger the 'correct' validation regex based on a range of words... it would be handy for multi-lang to have that kind of stuff in arrays, so in my language "plaats" but also "woonplaats" would trigger cause essentially these mean the same thing
2013-01-11 15:14:46	supersym	which, with css selectors, is really easy
2013-01-11 15:15:48	supersym	also i did the same with a basic name scheme for form names/ids which would be able to trigger processing but this 'plugin' and you'd be able to do it fine grained with classes on the fields
2013-01-11 15:16:21	supersym	e.g. ".validate" and ".required"\
2013-01-11 15:16:59	supersym	only thing i wasnt happy about was that we used images to display errors/ok
2013-01-11 15:17:14	supersym	these should be highly customizable css / fonts
2013-01-11 15:19:24	supersym	but really the 1k dollar question whats been holding me a bit back, is the way to configure plugins
2013-01-11 15:20:04	supersym	as balupton posted elsewhere about abstracting out plugin logic etc, i dont think we have any really 'user-friendly' way of having the end-user configure plugins
2013-01-11 15:20:21	supersym	as i believe they'll have to dig down node_modules/ atm am I correct?
2013-01-11 15:20:43	supersym	or would it pick up any settings that would be placed in docpad.cson e.g.?
2013-01-11 15:22:57	supersym	I imagine certain things to be configurable from the document meta-data, some from the getForms() e.g. helper function which would be declarable inside the plugin configuration somewhere
2013-01-11 15:24:09	supersym	and passing some kind of variable data along where needed...the problem indeed is: you don't want to have a seperate 'short-hand' like notation scheme nearing a 'language on it's own'
2013-01-11 15:24:25	supersym	but at the same time take away some of the pain of typing so much
2013-01-11 15:25:05	supersym	and some form of templating in the sense of 'contact form' or 'job application form' kind-of-logic might be sensible
2013-01-11 15:25:59	supersym	then hooking it up a server-side asp/php cgi script all it takes is change the 'name' attribute according to what the server is expecting
2013-01-11 15:26:36	supersym	before that, you've rerouted the form data to be validated (regex) and inspected / serialized the strings for illegal chars etc
2013-01-11 15:26:54	supersym	both would be coverable by existing solutions mashed up
2013-01-11 15:47:39	supersym	https://github.com/search?q=forms&p=1&ref=searchbar&type=Repositories&l=CoffeeScript
2013-01-11 15:47:55	supersym	guess i should start hashing those out for activity and appliance

2013-01-11 15:50:41	supersym	We hope to take like %30-%50 of the pain of handcrafting good html forms.
2013-01-11 15:50:48	supersym	sounds good already :P
2013-01-11 15:52:09	supersym	shame its dead-end project :S
2013-01-11 15:54:39	supersym	This library uses the HTML5 validation attributes. ~> anyone ever seen the 
2013-01-11 15:55:29	supersym	'fun' chrome validation... forces up a tooltip in english hardly customizable
2013-01-11 15:56:12	supersym	so imho any html5 validation is off as a viable option
2013-01-11 15:56:29	supersym	this time its not MS/IE giving you headaches (yet)
2013-01-11 16:19:19	-->	kaspertidemann (~Kasper@2605ds2-bav.0.fullrate.dk) has joined #docpad
2013-01-11 16:22:39	ashnur	uh
2013-01-11 16:22:49	ashnur	you should really blog some times
2013-01-11 16:23:00	ashnur	you certainly can fill it up
2013-01-11 16:24:38	ashnur	you can configure plugins through docpad.coffee
2013-01-11 16:24:51	ashnur	there are many examples for this, i am sure you saw them already
2013-01-11 16:25:40	ashnur	and in general
2013-01-11 16:26:14	ashnur	it's good if you don't solve problem you don't have. or at least not before it is their time unless you want to get into academics
2013-01-11 16:59:38	supersym	haha thanks... I guess :P
2013-01-11 16:59:46	supersym	yeah I can be a bit verbose
2013-01-11 17:00:02	supersym	just -q if you want me to tone it down ;)
2013-01-11 17:02:21	supersym	its not so much about my problem solving, as I could still fairly quickly type up any html manually using shorthand/conversion, but more as in pragmatics, laziness I guess... but perhaps even more the tendency of 'it isn't easy enough' or 'not flexible enough'
2013-01-11 17:02:52	supersym	also since i tend to rely heavily on existing solutions, its more of a question of how to 'mold them together' and where to perform a specific hack
2013-01-11 17:03:31	supersym	but as a different example, concerning docpad, amuse me on the part academics perhaps
2013-01-11 17:04:26	supersym	but say i wanted to implement a feature somewhere, and all it would take is the addition of say 3,4,5 lines of code into an existing docpad plugin
2013-01-11 17:04:46	supersym	i ponder, from the perspective of DRY
2013-01-11 17:05:04	supersym	of course I could easily hack that after I cloned that plugin
2013-01-11 17:05:21	supersym	but say you'd want to facilitate that for other users
2013-01-11 17:05:56	supersym	wouldn't like a 'patch' kind of solution be more to the point, compared to what I'd do now, is fork, modify, and eventually publish under a different name
2013-01-11 17:06:43	supersym	e.g. with coffeecontracts, or perhaps some additional tweaks in configuration concerning minimizing stuff (uglify perhaps)
2013-01-11 17:09:56	ashnur	it really depends what is you have to do multiple times
2013-01-11 17:10:06	ashnur	dry doesn't apply if it's a one time thing
2013-01-11 17:10:28	ashnur	i kinda do shitty lowcost websites
2013-01-11 17:10:36	ashnur	sitebuild and basic setup
2013-01-11 17:11:07	ashnur	so for me its install docpad, get a skeleton, strip the stupid jquery, add some basic stuff which actually means npm install --save 
2013-01-11 17:11:09	supersym	oh no I guess not and it's not like forking stuff is such a hard thing... it would be mostly from a organizational perspective perhaps
2013-01-11 17:11:17	supersym	true true
2013-01-11 17:11:28	ashnur	then create partials as the layout, then style it, then js, and it's done 
2013-01-11 17:11:39	supersym	yeah i'll do a lot of those as well
2013-01-11 17:11:50	ashnur	even if its forms, i don't care about client side validation, and if someone asks for it, i install a standalone js thing which i am sure there are many
2013-01-11 17:12:01	supersym	a lot yeah
2013-01-11 17:12:14	ashnur	there are some form related js libs which I use
2013-01-11 17:12:20	supersym	well its easy to see why a lot of ppl tend to go for jquery from their point of view
2013-01-11 17:12:28	supersym	its easy enough and has tons of features
2013-01-11 17:13:21	ashnur	of course formidable
2013-01-11 17:13:24	ashnur	and
2013-01-11 17:13:36	ashnur	also http://formalize.me/ 
2013-01-11 17:13:45	supersym	just with the current way, again perhaps from docpad org viewpoint, if you'd want to support enough hooks/features and what not, its a question of what would/should be core and what can/should be external
2013-01-11 17:13:57	supersym	and what you just plain don't want/need to be connected
2013-01-11 17:14:30	supersym	to docpad as a 'framework' that is
2013-01-11 17:14:37	supersym	aha
2013-01-11 17:14:56	supersym	yeah...if there is a online API kind of generator/provider
2013-01-11 17:15:06	supersym	that should probably always be first choice
2013-01-11 17:15:18	supersym	but maybe that's just me though
2013-01-11 17:15:20	ashnur	dunno. i don't think forms are something which should be supported by default other than a plugin maybe, and if it's a plugin, there can be many plugins each for specific use cases
2013-01-11 17:15:24	supersym	I'd like to know about these things
2013-01-11 17:15:42	supersym	so service hooks, where possible, might be a intresting thing to implement if anyu
2013-01-11 17:16:03	supersym	and if the service, third party, is trustworthy enough to rely upon being available
2013-01-11 17:16:24	supersym	but simply pointing someone to the URL might also be enough if their web interface is kickass as it iss
2013-01-11 17:17:11	supersym	I guess I should really start using the forum as well... post more stuff there in a coherent way ^^
2013-01-11 17:17:18	supersym	instead of flooding the chan :P
2013-01-11 17:18:34	ashnur	there is no forum
2013-01-11 17:18:40	ashnur	afaik
2013-01-11 17:18:51	ashnur	it's SO or chat
2013-01-11 17:19:15	ashnur	but there are github issues also which are just for things like these
2013-01-11 17:19:20	supersym	ok

2013-01-11 23:30:37	woah	hey, dumb question, but installing plugins is not working
2013-01-11 23:31:05	woah	ran "sudo npm install --save docpad-plugin-coffeekup"
2013-01-11 23:31:36	woah	did everything it needed to do, but when i docpad run, it thinks there are no plugins installed
2013-01-11 23:39:07	woah	nvm guys
2013-01-11 23:44:34	ashnur	:D
2013-01-11 23:45:21	woah	there was a node_modules folder in the parent dir and it was installing the plugins there
2013-01-11 23:45:30	woah	need to get better at node, really
2013-01-11 23:45:55	ashnur	you don't have to sudo npm only and only if you want a global install
2013-01-11 23:47:00	ashnur	so, when you want something to be available in the cli, like docpad, coffee-script,  browserify, forever then in some cases you might need sudo
2013-01-11 23:47:20	ashnur	but when you install in a projects folder modules, you most probably don't
2013-01-11 23:48:32	woah	ah well it prints out a list of errors when i don't sudo

2013-01-11 23:54:43	woah	indeed
2013-01-11 23:54:48	woah	well i'll figure it out
2013-01-12 00:14:56	woah	hey, is there any better way to debug than the terminal that docpad is running in?
2013-01-12 00:15:11	woah	it won't tell me which file has a problem
2013-01-12 00:15:15	woah	just the line number
2013-01-12 00:19:46	ashnur	?
2013-01-12 00:20:04	ashnur	how is that possible
2013-01-12 00:21:06	woah	oh man, i need to take a step back before i post in here
2013-01-12 00:21:12	woah	feel free to ignore me
2013-01-12 00:21:20	woah	its right there at the top
2013-01-12 00:21:40	woah	friday afternoon :P
2013-01-12 00:21:47	supersym	i'm actually doing some work on a tutorial covering this 'problem' on the use of sudo and how/when to not use it
2013-01-12 00:22:33	supersym	its a tad too much text now though... I should point towards some good post someone made and seriously cut down the word count :P
2013-01-12 00:23:09	supersym	you really shouldn't have to use 'sudo' at all, even for global installs
2013-01-12 00:23:34	supersym	unless you want to have package binaries compile with root permissions :P
2013-01-12 00:25:04	supersym	and then, do you know which ones get their setuid file attribute flag set? unless u run a security program frequently checking setuid sticky bits, I find it an overkill to run node.js installs and global binaries as root
2013-01-12 00:26:43	woah	i personally wouldnt mind a lot of text on the subject, as long as it is understandable
2013-01-12 00:27:29	supersym	it's very complete in the sense that its elaborate on why this is a problem exactly... but only if you find 'proper use' in the context of security worth something
2013-01-12 00:27:46	supersym	very raw long version and incomplete
2013-01-12 00:28:36	supersym	https://github.com/supersym/personal.publishing/blob/develop/docpad/01_how_to_setup_nodejs_properly_unices.md
2013-01-12 00:29:01	supersym	that is, as in not intended for windows tho
2013-01-12 00:29:58	supersym	and if you want to install in a existing hierarchical folder, like /usr/local you'll need the root permissions to modify the owner/group if you want to do that
2013-01-12 00:30:51	supersym	so I guess I should add some parts on the installation under $HOME, compiling node.js and why you should keep the source code somewhere, besides the finished product in /usr/local/lib or ~/.local/lib or whatnot
2013-01-12 00:34:27	supersym	i guess spliting the 'sudo' part from the 'python version' part would be sensible in order to cut it down and stay more within scope of the article
2013-01-12 00:36:35	woah	hmm will read over the weekend and try to get things set up right
2013-01-12 00:36:42	supersym	anyway it boils down to the fact that if you are serious about your node setup, you'll want to manually configure and then compile the source code to have more flexibility where to place the compiled node.js (and npm) program files
2013-01-12 00:37:41	woah	ah
2013-01-12 00:38:30	woah	hey, I'm now getting: info: Currently on renderFiles at 75%
2013-01-12 00:38:39	woah	when i docpad run
2013-01-12 00:38:47	woah	seems to have gotten stuck
2013-01-12 00:39:03	supersym	i dont know that status message but then again, dont know if i missed on a update or something :P
2013-01-12 00:39:46	woah	strange stuff
2013-01-12 00:40:03	woah	going to strip out files until it goes away
2013-01-12 00:40:08	supersym	just ctrl+c (on linux/osx/bash) and try again, if it fails cancel and perhaps try `docpad generate` first or `docpad clean`
2013-01-12 00:40:23	supersym	also u can use `docpad run -d` to debug
2013-01-12 00:40:35	supersym	and pinpoint the problem area a bit better
2013-01-12 00:40:56	supersym	depending on how much files you have, could be a long list
2013-01-12 00:41:11	supersym	but it'll show the names of files it fails to render
2013-01-12 00:42:39	woah	ah
2013-01-12 00:42:45	woah	it was an empty css file
2013-01-12 00:43:22	supersym	:)
2013-01-12 00:43:51	woah	thanks for the pointer on docpad run -d though
2013-01-12 00:43:52	supersym	yeah i dont think it likes any empty files...though it should check for that I would assume
2013-01-12 00:43:58	supersym	:) yw

2013-01-12 09:09:23	qwebirc5816	i have problems using docpad with accents
2013-01-12 09:09:49	qwebirc5816	when I use accents in a template it gets chopped on the actual website
2013-01-12 09:10:37	qwebirc5816	if i can't get it to work i will need to stop uisng docpad :(

2013-01-12 09:11:42	qwebirc5816	yes
2013-01-12 09:12:01	ashnur	qwebirc5816: it is most probably that either your files aren't in utf8 or you are not sending the data as utf8, or some issue along this line
2013-01-12 09:12:16	supersym	i'm guessing file encoding too
2013-01-12 09:12:27	ashnur	qwebirc5816: docpad has no problem with these things at all
2013-01-12 09:12:41	supersym	try $ file myfile.ext
2013-01-12 09:13:01	qwebirc5816	everything is set to utf8
2013-01-12 09:13:10	ashnur	there was someone having some issue like this a few days ago, and he solved it by adding the meta tag to the html
2013-01-12 09:13:22	supersym	using docpad-server?
2013-01-12 09:13:40	ashnur	qwebirc5816: trust me. it is not a docpad issue. there is almost no chance for that to happen
2013-01-12 09:13:54	supersym	of
2013-01-12 09:14:04	qwebirc5816	but it does :(
2013-01-12 09:14:20	supersym	meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html;charset=utf-8" is ofc needed ashnur :)
2013-01-12 09:14:31	qwebirc5816	let me try it
2013-01-12 09:15:11	ashnur	supersym: actually, it is not needed
2013-01-12 09:15:14	supersym	yeah and check perhaps for any other utf-8 sign
2013-01-12 09:15:25	supersym	no I realized just that
2013-01-12 09:15:31	ashnur	it's just a convenience stuff. maybe some older browsers need it
2013-01-12 09:15:31	supersym	as long as you use proper doctype
2013-01-12 09:15:35	supersym	or else stick to ascii
2013-01-12 09:15:39	supersym	you would be fine
2013-01-12 09:16:03	supersym	charset that is...
2013-01-12 09:16:12	ashnur	proper doctype os <!doctype html>
2013-01-12 09:16:17	ashnur	is*
2013-01-12 09:16:41	ashnur	you have to send the data with the correct headers not with the correct markup. markup is hell.
2013-01-12 09:16:41	supersym	yeah right after that i always use meta charset...
2013-01-12 09:16:49	supersym	true
2013-01-12 09:16:53	ashnur	well, it's good practice to use it
2013-01-12 09:16:57	ashnur	i use it too
2013-01-12 09:17:06	ashnur	just because it's easier than not using it :D
2013-01-12 09:17:08	supersym	if you have a crappy server sending the wrong header info
2013-01-12 09:17:23	supersym	you'll still get fecked
2013-01-12 09:17:42	supersym	like node.js http-server example and javascript files :P
2013-01-12 09:18:02	supersym	it sees them, all files, as the same type
2013-01-12 09:20:06	ashnur	i have trouble with forever
2013-01-12 09:20:19	ashnur	it says that We couldn't find an existing DocPad project inside your current directory. Looked at: /
2013-01-12 09:20:22	supersym	what process do you want to watchdog?
2013-01-12 09:20:38	supersym	the docpad-server instance or?
2013-01-12 09:20:41	ashnur	i am trying to do: # forever start /home/ashnur/deployed/stropi/app.js
2013-01-12 09:20:45	supersym	ah ok
2013-01-12 09:21:00	ashnur	i have an app.js file which works if I just do node app.js
2013-01-12 09:21:19	ashnur	i don't know how to explain to forever to use the app's dir
2013-01-12 09:21:26	supersym	pastebin source somewhere?
2013-01-12 09:21:27	ashnur	it doesn't work if I cd there
2013-01-12 09:21:29	supersym	i can have a look
2013-01-12 09:21:33	ashnur	what source?
2013-01-12 09:21:37	ashnur	the app.js ?
2013-01-12 09:21:37	supersym	app.js
2013-01-12 09:21:40	supersym	or all
2013-01-12 09:21:49	ashnur	all what? :D
2013-01-12 09:22:10	supersym	project ofc :P although i doubt any much more then just app.js would affect it
2013-01-12 09:22:28	supersym	it's hard shooting blindfolded anyway :D
2013-01-12 09:22:46	ashnur	and it's quite a large thing
2013-01-12 09:23:04	ashnur	and i don't think it is because of the app.js file, as the error I get when running forever is that 
2013-01-12 09:23:30	ashnur	We couldn't find an existing DocPad project inside your current directory. Looked at: / 
2013-01-12 09:23:43	ashnur	so the current dir is always /

2013-01-12 09:25:46	supersym	must be something really easy like that as well :P
2013-01-12 09:26:30	ashnur	fuck yeah, it works
2013-01-12 09:27:25	supersym	:) sweet
2013-01-12 09:27:53	ashnur	now let's see if it works when i reboot
2013-01-12 09:29:21	ashnur	and it does. now let's kill the frikin process 
2013-01-12 09:37:00	qwebirc5816	i get an error everytime i try to render with accents
2013-01-12 09:37:20	supersym	where are you using these accents? not that it should matter too much
2013-01-12 09:37:33	qwebirc5816	in the document
2013-01-12 09:37:37	supersym	can you show me the html element, or docpad section where you use it
2013-01-12 09:37:46	supersym	what lang? html, eco, jade?
2013-01-12 09:38:05	supersym	inside meta-data or document body?

2013-01-12 09:39:19	supersym	first-off... you do have a src/layouts/default.eco file right? The 'meta' tag goes in there, since that part
2013-01-12 09:39:26	supersym	generates the HTML document head
2013-01-12 09:39:33	supersym	which is where meta tags go
2013-01-12 09:39:59	supersym	e.g. https://github.com/vitch/twitter-bootstrap-skeleton.docpad/blob/master/src/layouts/default.html.eco
2013-01-12 09:40:16	supersym	notice line 5

2013-01-12 09:41:12	qwebirc5816	here's the default.html.eco
2013-01-12 09:41:17	supersym	aha
2013-01-12 09:41:20	supersym	i think i see it
2013-01-12 09:41:33	supersym	run docpad and check inside your browser the source code
2013-01-12 09:41:41	supersym	or check out/index.html
2013-01-12 09:41:54	qwebirc5816	it does not render
2013-01-12 09:42:09	qwebirc5816	I can't check the output, the accents stop the rendering

2013-01-12 09:43:29	qwebirc5816	I removed the markdown
2013-01-12 09:43:31	supersym	to start off, not all markdown properly handles utf
2013-01-12 09:43:45	qwebirc5816	I tried with index.htrml and it does not work
2013-01-12 09:43:50	supersym	so it would be good to know where exactly the rendering stops
2013-01-12 09:43:59	supersym	using docpad generate -d (for debug)
2013-01-12 09:44:10	supersym	ok let me test here a bit

2013-01-12 09:45:53	qwebirc5816	the render stops at index.html...

2013-01-12 09:48:00	qwebirc5816	you used the boilerplate skeleton too?
2013-01-12 09:48:04	supersym	its fine here
2013-01-12 09:48:10	supersym	do locale at the cli
2013-01-12 09:48:13	supersym	$ locale
2013-01-12 09:48:17	supersym	in your shell
2013-01-12 09:48:30	supersym	first skeleton i took
2013-01-12 09:48:37	supersym	and i did a fresh update of docpad
2013-01-12 09:48:44	supersym	using $ npm i -g docpad
2013-01-12 09:48:52	supersym	you probably need to use sudo before that :P
2013-01-12 09:49:28	supersym	ensure your system environment variables are proper utf-8 encoded
2013-01-12 09:49:34	supersym	also now you removed the accents
2013-01-12 09:49:52	supersym	i'd like you to check inside your browser the index.html file
2013-01-12 09:50:14	supersym	what browser do you use?
2013-01-12 09:50:17	qwebirc5816	chrome
2013-01-12 09:50:24	qwebirc5816	everything is utf8 in the locales

2013-01-12 09:51:27	supersym	see if your http headers are set correctly
2013-01-12 09:51:47	qwebirc5816	i do the npm thing now
2013-01-12 09:52:02	supersym	although i think, ashnur correct me, if i remember correctly that it will be ascii untill utf-8 is detected??
2013-01-12 09:52:03	ashnur	the headers are the most important
2013-01-12 09:52:27	supersym	so a pure ascii html file has different encoding from one with utf-8 right>
2013-01-12 09:52:31	ashnur	well, each browser has default it will use if nothing is present
2013-01-12 09:52:35	supersym	ok
2013-01-12 09:53:03	ashnur	but those are a lot of the times not unicode defaults 
2013-01-12 09:53:47	ashnur	what bugs me that if that is the problem, it shouldn't be truncated but dispplayed in a wrong format
2013-01-12 09:54:06	ashnur	so if it is truncated it means that something is wrong before it reaches the browser
2013-01-12 09:54:16	qwebirc5816	ok now i'm ran docpad run for the first time...
2013-01-12 09:54:33	supersym	ah wait
2013-01-12 09:54:39	supersym	now i get the error too

2013-01-12 10:04:11	supersym	you may have the 'meta tag' and 'meta-data' thing mixed up :P
2013-01-12 10:04:49	supersym	the stuff between --- in src/documents files is meta-data passed to the docpad instance running (process)
2013-01-12 10:05:02	supersym	its in yaml (or optionally cson) data format
2013-01-12 10:05:14	supersym	and that line isn't the correct notation :)
2013-01-12 10:05:21	supersym	so it will render a error
2013-01-12 10:06:05	supersym	there is really fun stuff you can do with it tho
2013-01-12 10:06:53	supersym	have docpad meta-data in document between --- and use below in the body, but also docpad.cson (fields,scripts,functions) -> document...and back
2013-01-12 10:07:03	supersym	its extremely flexible
2013-01-12 10:07:50	supersym	check out the tutorial at http://docpad.org/docs/intro
2013-01-12 10:08:56	supersym	perhaps it may take some time of using before you 'really get it' but that doesnt have to stop you from just using it in whatever language you like
2013-01-12 10:09:36	supersym	and it may at points be a somewhat steepish learning curve
2013-01-12 10:10:18	supersym	but we are here to help, and if you're a bit more adventureous, you can dig in the source code to get the really fine-grained details on how it works
2013-01-12 10:10:42	supersym	if you can read coffeescript that is, or its compiled js output...
2013-01-12 11:26:34	ashnur	finaly i've got the thing working
2013-01-12 11:27:16	ashnur	i have a vps with nginx wordpress docpad where the wordpress posts get fetched with docpad after publish and saved as source documents

2013-01-12 17:35:00	supersym	what's -f?
2013-01-12 17:35:16	supersym	i just always do $ npm i -g docpad
2013-01-12 17:35:50	supersym	i dont think you need to specify the version explicitly
2013-01-12 17:35:55	balupton	-f is --force, so refetch all dependencies, and don't use any from cache
2013-01-12 17:35:57	mikeumus	8o, what's that do?
2013-01-12 17:36:09	mikeumus	ok
2013-01-12 17:36:10	supersym	reinstall docpad in the global module folder
2013-01-12 17:36:16	mikeumus	I see
2013-01-12 17:36:23	balupton	 "npm install -fg docpad@6.21" is actually our recommended install instructions
2013-01-12 17:36:27	balupton	;)
2013-01-12 17:36:29	supersym	ok
2013-01-12 17:36:30	mikeumus	npm i -g -f docpad
2013-01-12 17:36:33	mikeumus	8)
2013-01-12 17:36:34	balupton	but yeah, it is strange that cloud9 is playing up for you
2013-01-12 17:36:54	mikeumus	well not really, it has it's issues,... 8(
2013-01-12 17:36:55	supersym	balupton: care to share the logic behind it?
2013-01-12 17:37:00	balupton	my only guess is that the new version was installed somewhere else...
2013-01-12 17:37:08	supersym	:)
2013-01-12 17:37:34	supersym	yeah somewhere in you $PATH
2013-01-12 17:37:42	supersym	there's prolly a ghost
2013-01-12 17:38:09	balupton	we use --force as a lot of times without it, someone will have a botched version of a dependency already installed, so when they try to run docpad, something goes wrong, with --force everything is the latest, so less chance of getting botched verisons
2013-01-12 17:38:11	supersym	start at the beginning of the array, since it's overriding your other docpad
2013-01-12 17:38:34	supersym	oh ok
2013-01-12 17:39:05	supersym	you enforce npm install on the modules and verify engine symvers?
2013-01-12 17:39:40	supersym	i guess i have no idea how nodejs can go down dependency hell
2013-01-12 17:39:47	supersym	thats how perfect it runs
2013-01-12 17:39:51	balupton	mikeumus - one suggestion, is just doing "npm install -f docpad" so install it locally, then run it via, "./node_modules/.bin/docpad run" - doesn't fix the global install not working, but does provide a good workaround for the meantime
2013-01-12 17:40:33	balupton	supersym: we specify dependency version strictly, but doesn't mean a dependency we depend on does
2013-01-12 17:40:40	supersym	can't you do a whereis?
2013-01-12 17:40:53	supersym	yeah
2013-01-12 17:41:28	supersym	guess you can never really outban the risk of breaking stuff
2013-01-12 17:42:03	mikeumus	ok

2013-01-12 17:50:48	mikeumus	warning:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Rendering the extension "eco" to "html" on "index.html.eco" didn't do anything.                                                                                                                         
2013-01-12 17:50:55	mikeumus	I dont' know if that's normal or not
2013-01-12 17:54:05	mikeumus	opps I have a out folder in the node_modules/docpad folder, is that how it's support to be setup?
2013-01-12 17:54:11	mikeumus	https://c9.io/mikeumus/killer-confidence_com
2013-01-12 17:54:34	mikeumus	I was working with src and out in the root directory 
2013-01-12 17:54:42	mikeumus	it seemed to be working
2013-01-12 17:54:59	mikeumus	besides for the fact that it wasn't using @content in default.html.coffee
2013-01-12 17:55:02	supersym	the out/ is normal
2013-01-12 17:55:42	supersym	well do you have the eco plugin in node_modules?
2013-01-12 17:56:17	mikeumus	node_modules/docpad-plugin-eco yes
2013-01-12 17:56:24	mikeumus	and in package.json
2013-01-12 17:58:42	mikeumus	okay so two out folders, one at project root and another in node_modules/docpad/out is normal then right?
2013-01-12 17:58:45	supersym	did 'npm i'?
2013-01-12 17:58:53	supersym	yes
2013-01-12 17:58:57	mikeumus	ok
2013-01-12 17:59:08	supersym	one is where your site output files, the html, css, js goes
2013-01-12 17:59:22	supersym	but you could change that with a setting in config file
2013-01-12 17:59:31	mikeumus	ok
2013-01-12 18:00:05	supersym	the other one is where the source code of docpad gets compiled to
2013-01-12 18:00:32	mikeumus	so any idea why I'm getting that warning that .html didn't go to .eco? Do I need the path in my package.json to incluce "./node_modules/" maybe?
2013-01-12 18:00:36	supersym	from .coffee in src, to lib/ or out/ for .js
2013-01-12 18:00:37	mikeumus	include*
2013-01-12 18:00:56	supersym	tru and generate with the -d switch
2013-01-12 18:00:56	mikeumus	like how the "./node_modules/.bin/docpad run" worked
2013-01-12 18:01:06	supersym	you will get some more verbose output
2013-01-12 18:01:32	supersym	pin-point the problem a bit
2013-01-12 18:01:44	mikeumus	ok
2013-01-12 18:01:52	supersym	but is there any reason you wouldn't want to reinstall docpad simply?
2013-01-12 18:02:10	supersym	do a $ whereis docpad (at cli)
2013-01-12 18:02:38	supersym	but also btw
2013-01-12 18:02:49	supersym	the docpad-plugin-eco shouldn't be global ofc
2013-01-12 18:03:22	supersym	only docpad (optionally) would be a globally installed node.js package, due to it's command-line application and you want to use it everywhere
2013-01-12 18:04:20	supersym	then you pick a folder, docpad skeleton or empty project, either modify/make a package file with your docpad-plugins as dependencies
2013-01-12 18:04:24	supersym	npm i in the root
2013-01-12 18:04:32	supersym	and you should be fine
2013-01-12 18:05:16	supersym	also can you share the exact error message? when using -d like $ docpad generate -d
2013-01-12 18:05:51	mikeumus	so there are two package.json's?
2013-01-12 18:06:21	supersym	probably all node.js projects, so including docpad and most docpad plugins, have package.json files yes
2013-01-12 18:06:51	mikeumus	what I mean is one in the root of the project and then another for the part that actaully gets deployed?
2013-01-12 18:06:56	supersym	you should teach yourself to write them, it's a powertool 
2013-01-12 18:07:10	supersym	well that depends where you deploy to
2013-01-12 18:07:30	supersym	if you just host static html/css/js files for browser-side
2013-01-12 18:07:41	supersym	you wouldn't need it for deployment
2013-01-12 18:08:02	supersym	if you deploy to nodejitsu or heroku i think you even must have one in the project root
2013-01-12 18:09:03	mikeumus	I'm trying to use @content and am deploying to nodejutsu
2013-01-12 18:09:12	mikeumus	I've written a couple package.json's before yet,
2013-01-12 18:09:15	mikeumus	yes*
2013-01-12 18:12:17	mikeumus	would you mind snooping around my project for a minute and trying to see why @content in default.html.coffee isn't importing anything?
2013-01-12 18:12:18	mikeumus	https://c9.io/mikeumus/killer-confidence_com
2013-01-12 18:12:38	mikeumus	does that warning mean the eco plugin isn't installed properly?
2013-01-12 18:13:01	supersym	http://docs.jit.su/articles/getting-started/npm/what-is-the-file-package-json
2013-01-12 18:13:12	supersym	sure
2013-01-12 18:14:10	mikeumus	Thanks supersym for the link, I've been working with node as a project manager for a year now so I know what the package.json file is.   ;)
2013-01-12 18:18:14	supersym	i dont have permissions to look into your home
2013-01-12 18:18:27	supersym	need the command line if you'd like me to look further
2013-01-12 18:21:50	supersym	u there?
2013-01-12 18:22:09	ashnur	balupton: i have one last issue with the WP thing before i start to clean it up to be usable by others. If I delete a post/or rename it in WP, now it creates a new document and the last one remains as garbage. Now the WP post_id is save into the meta data, and I am thinking about using that as a unique identifier, but I am still not sure on how to do it.  either i keep track of the modifications and if a new
2013-01-12 18:22:12	ashnur	file created I delete the old one, or I just keep modifying the same file? renaming the actual directories and stuff? 
2013-01-12 18:22:43	supersym	or else you might just wanna pop in the console and do a 'grep version ~/src/node_modules/docpad/package.json' and see if that lands
2013-01-12 18:25:14	mikeumus	k
2013-01-12 18:26:00	mikeumus	I granted Read/Write Access now
2013-01-12 18:26:09	mikeumus	you should be able to refresh and see sstuff
2013-01-12 18:26:18	supersym	thnx
2013-01-12 18:27:11	mikeumus	I don't have a node_modules in src it seems
2013-01-12 18:32:22	supersym	--b.j-
2013-01-12 18:32:26	supersym	thats the root cause
2013-01-12 18:32:34	supersym	a malformed meta-data seperator
2013-01-12 18:32:45	supersym	in the index
2013-01-12 18:33:57	mikeumus	in index.html.eco ?
2013-01-12 18:34:10	mikeumus	of the default.html.coffee
2013-01-12 18:34:42	mikeumus	I used the html2coffeekup modeule to out put that default.html.coffe file
2013-01-12 18:38:07	supersym	i think i found it
2013-01-12 18:38:50	mikeumus	ok
2013-01-12 18:39:38	mikeumus	we have to stay vigilant in case the C9 editor start disappearing code while we're both in the file. That's when it usually happens. 
2013-01-12 18:43:11	supersym	hmmm...nope not it.. also my sample file doesnt render

2013-01-12 18:50:25	supersym	removed npm and added docpad

2013-01-12 18:53:29	supersym	might be it...sorry i have to run for a sec
2013-01-12 18:58:08	mikeumus	no problem, thanks for looking into it
2013-01-12 18:58:29	mikeumus	there really isn't any work in the project yet, I can always start fresh with a proper skeleton and some guidance

2013-01-12 21:36:45	alexkaare	what do you guys find is best for free hosting docpad?
2013-01-12 21:36:48	alexkaare	appfog?
2013-01-12 21:37:05	supersym	im on my gfs laptop now...fun doing all this nodejs /git etc in powershell
2013-01-12 21:37:18	supersym	depends on what you need
2013-01-12 21:37:43	alexkaare	well i'm currently on nodejitsu
2013-01-12 21:37:49	supersym	dynamic or static sites...if fully static and want to be free, i think github pages are nice
2013-01-12 21:37:52	supersym	ok
2013-01-12 21:38:12	supersym	i didnt like the way their ´plan' was trying to trick me with stuff
2013-01-12 21:38:14	alexkaare	i wanted to use dynamic pages
2013-01-12 21:38:23	supersym	so i like heroku better
2013-01-12 21:38:36	supersym	then again havent tried much else
2013-01-12 21:38:36	alexkaare	but feedr and dynamic: true seems to error
2013-01-12 21:38:59	alexkaare	so i'm setting the config to regen every hour for now
2013-01-12 21:39:15	alexkaare	on heroku the free apps poer down when not in use
2013-01-12 21:39:16	supersym	hmm i never tried feedr
2013-01-12 21:39:23	alexkaare	power*
2013-01-12 21:39:34	supersym	yeah
2013-01-12 21:40:07	alexkaare	i setup a free pingdom account to ping my app on intervals which seem to keep it up
2013-01-12 21:40:30	supersym	personally if id use docpad for dynamic sites, id prolly use it with express
2013-01-12 21:40:46	supersym	feedr does that publish or receive rss?
2013-01-12 21:40:58	supersym	publish i guess... :P

2013-01-13 02:34:26	supersym	thats what docpad does, fork some repos
2013-01-13 02:34:34	supersym	merge in a few upstreams

2013-01-13 03:50:56	quesada	is it worth learning?
2013-01-13 03:50:59	quesada	:)
2013-01-13 03:51:24	supersymmetry	with its flexible rules, you can nearly copy/paste anything in
2013-01-13 03:51:35	supersymmetry	all but for the significant white-space :P
2013-01-13 03:51:37	quesada	you mean stylus
2013-01-13 03:51:41	supersymmetry	yeah...
2013-01-13 03:51:44	quesada	I mean sass
2013-01-13 03:51:49	supersymmetry	it pwns sass
2013-01-13 03:52:05	quesada	but sass has zurb foundation
2013-01-13 03:52:20	supersymmetry	yup
2013-01-13 03:52:24	supersymmetry	but also stylus
2013-01-13 03:52:30	supersymmetry	let me look...
2013-01-13 03:52:30	quesada	I'm not gonna port that to stylus
2013-01-13 03:53:01	quesada	plus there's a lot of work already in the sass thing I'm moving to docpad
2013-01-13 03:53:03	woah	supersymmetry: reading your writeup on the sudo issues
2013-01-13 03:53:06	woah	great!
2013-01-13 03:53:12	woah	this is the problem i'm having

2013-01-13 03:53:38	supersymmetry	personally, I use http://semantic.gs/ 
2013-01-13 03:53:39	woah	wait so you like stylus better?
2013-01-13 03:53:51	supersymmetry	its more rich in features
2013-01-13 03:54:27	supersymmetry	http://designshack.net/articles/css/sass-vs-stylus-who-wins-the-minimal-syntax-battle/
2013-01-13 03:54:45	quesada	yes, I saw this
2013-01-13 03:55:34	supersymmetry	its a close one according to their review
2013-01-13 03:56:08	supersymmetry	stylus has https://github.com/visionmedia/nib
2013-01-13 03:56:15	quesada	I know
2013-01-13 03:56:23	quesada	but part of the app is in django
2013-01-13 03:56:30	quesada	no stylus there
2013-01-13 03:57:53	supersymmetry	so it seems
2013-01-13 03:57:57	supersymmetry	didnt know that
2013-01-13 03:58:31	supersymmetry	well i had that with all other static-site generators out there
2013-01-13 03:59:17	supersymmetry	none would have my mix of flavours :P
2013-01-13 03:59:22	supersymmetry	except docpad tho
2013-01-13 04:02:05	supersymmetry	any change you can just include the styles behind the imports?
2013-01-13 04:02:23	supersymmetry	you'll want to compact and minimize in the end anyway
2013-01-13 04:02:57	supersymmetry	i assume
2013-01-13 04:04:42	supersymmetry	oh wait nvm
2013-01-13 04:05:24	supersymmetry	its foundation..you'll be using the sass stylesheets for seperate for overview during devel
2013-01-13 04:05:54	supersymmetry	i really just usually hand-craft the buttons and other elements
2013-01-13 04:06:11	supersymmetry	thats why I only use a grid from most of these frameworks
2013-01-13 04:06:18	supersymmetry	so it's a big overkill
2013-01-13 04:10:27	quesada	I need to find a docpad + foundation example :)
2013-01-13 04:12:48	quesada	there was a post somewhere on github on how ben does away with frameworks
2013-01-13 04:15:56	supersymmetry	i guess that depends on what data you want to display and what to render
2013-01-13 04:20:14	quesada	d
2013-01-13 04:20:25	quesada	do you know which page I'm talking about?
2013-01-13 04:20:29	quesada	it's stylus
2013-01-13 04:20:32	quesada	on github
2013-01-13 04:20:41	quesada	somewhere on github/docpad
2013-01-13 04:20:53	quesada	tips and tricks I think
2013-01-13 04:25:29	supersymmetry	no idea whatsoever
2013-01-13 04:28:43	balupton	quesada: is this what you're talking about? https://gist.github.com/1549029
2013-01-13 04:29:20	balupton	btw, we now list all the tips and tricks etc under the "nifties" section of the plugins page on the docpad website - http://docpad.org/docs/plugins - :)

2013-01-13 12:56:07	supersymmetry	damn damn what a stupid discussions at coffeescript about comment symbols
2013-01-13 12:56:44	supersymmetry	i also wonder why in hell they choose # to be the comment(out) symbol in the first place
2013-01-13 12:57:16	supersymmetry	probably 'must...do...better...than...js' urge and in the process shoot yourself in the foot
2013-01-13 13:58:17	balupton	# aligns with bash and other scripting languages
2013-01-13 14:09:45	supersymmetry	with which we have so much interaction... compared to, oh, say markdown
2013-01-13 14:10:31	supersymmetry	better to walk in line with totally different athletes... but hey, its got the word 'script' in it
2013-01-13 14:11:29	supersymmetry	oh well
2013-01-13 14:39:25	-->	ashnur (~ashnur@79.119.18.210) has joined #docpad
2013-01-13 14:53:48	ashnur	morning
2013-01-13 15:09:08	quesada	mornng
2013-01-13 15:09:47	supersymmetry	heya
2013-01-13 15:10:24	supersymmetry	https://github.com/supersym/custom-logger/blob/develop/test.coffee
2013-01-13 15:10:59	supersymmetry	@balupton: I guess thats a good time to setup some work geared towards i18n organized statusses?
2013-01-13 15:11:21	supersymmetry	I could try and do some pioneers work there to see if we can internationalize docpad a bit more :)
2013-01-13 15:14:28	supersymmetry	totally cool would be to hook it to a semantical tool that can properly pluralize, past, present tense etc but that might be a bit of a bridge too far
2013-01-13 15:16:12	supersymmetry	anyway this is just some fun freestyling - it would need some thought on what to stdout when, semi-automated pieces, and perhaps some even for a 'status' reserved portion of the CLI that has statusses on long running stuff
2013-01-13 15:16:25	supersymmetry	the only problem is - docpad is just too blazing fast :D
2013-01-13 15:16:44	supersymmetry	200-300 files can be done in a whim
2013-01-13 15:16:46	supersymmetry	:S
2013-01-13 15:16:48	supersymmetry	no fun
2013-01-13 15:17:49	supersymmetry	but the nice thing about that little collection im building there, is that you can have users pick what they need, plugins can hook upon certain events and a standardized way of broadcasting over stdout lines
2013-01-13 15:18:39	alexkaare	anyone got any example code for setting up a login area with docpad?
2013-01-13 15:18:42	supersymmetry	you could, if everything works flawlessly with the unicode (and it should) have them as icons next to 'maintained' plugin lists
2013-01-13 15:19:02	supersymmetry	no not yet - but was actually planning to do so since a day or two :D
2013-01-13 15:19:14	alexkaare	sweet :)
2013-01-13 15:19:14	supersymmetry	because I was wondering what I'd be able to do on that front
2013-01-13 15:19:21	supersymmetry	what do you have in mind>
2013-01-13 15:19:31	supersymmetry	what do you want to achieve?
2013-01-13 15:19:56	alexkaare	was gonna use docapad for my portfolio, but some work will not be public
2013-01-13 15:20:11	supersymmetry	ok
2013-01-13 15:20:15	alexkaare	was looking at express and passport
2013-01-13 15:20:32	supersymmetry	right
2013-01-13 15:21:09	supersymmetry	is that the only reason you'd want express? or you really need to have the routing?
2013-01-13 15:21:14	alexkaare	http://passportjs.org/guide/username-password/
2013-01-13 15:21:31	supersymmetry	what API/service you want to use passport on?
2013-01-13 15:21:51	alexkaare	not precious about express
2013-01-13 15:21:54	supersymmetry	i was just thinking of that too
2013-01-13 15:21:58	alexkaare	if you have something else in mind thats cool
2013-01-13 15:23:07	supersymmetry	nah... i was just earlier collecting encryption algorithms applied in js/cs
2013-01-13 15:23:36	supersymmetry	and figured you'd be able to do alot with plain sight (e.g. gist) storing of secrets
2013-01-13 15:23:46	supersymmetry	if you know how to encrypt the data :)
2013-01-13 15:24:21	supersymmetry	but anything else than secrets,..if ppl need to encrypt/decrypt or access data often
2013-01-13 15:25:00	supersymmetry	you'd be better off with like OAuth especially it its supposed to connect to public API's etc
2013-01-13 15:25:28	supersymmetry	dropbox, flikr, vimeo, youtube - dunno what you'd have in your portofolio
2013-01-13 15:25:52	supersymmetry	but nearly all are covered in passports i dare to bet
2013-01-13 15:26:24	alexkaare	yeah looks like it
2013-01-13 15:28:19	supersymmetry	so depending on who the third party/host is ... you'll have to find that strategy in passport
2013-01-13 15:28:49	supersymmetry	OAuth2, OpenID or something, custom stuff, I know there are many strategies for passport
2013-01-13 15:28:53	supersymmetry	maybe like a 100?
2013-01-13 15:29:12	supersymmetry	but if you want to host all stuff yourself
2013-01-13 15:29:36	supersymmetry	say using express/docpad-server on node platforms like heroku
2013-01-13 15:29:52	alexkaare	yeah thats what i was thinking
2013-01-13 15:31:58	supersymmetry	you'll need a server script to recieve the POST
2013-01-13 15:32:05	supersymmetry	but thats the easy part
2013-01-13 15:32:16	supersymmetry	atm docpad does not have a own permissions system
2013-01-13 15:32:35	supersymmetry	so you'll have to hash out how you want protect the private areas
2013-01-13 15:32:56	supersymmetry	but then again, using some meta-data field cant be too hard either
2013-01-13 15:33:24	supersymmetry	Im curious what balupton or ashnur have done in this area and if they can tell some more
2013-01-13 15:34:25	supersymmetry	the first one is prolly sleeping tho and i havent heard ashnur for a while either tho i think he's more in our time-zone
2013-01-13 15:34:44	alexkaare	i found this
2013-01-13 15:34:45	alexkaare	https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/docpad/DD1AtiUv0_E/ai9cV1Jn3_AJ
2013-01-13 15:37:46	supersymmetry	i really start to like this elegance in coffeescript / docpad ^^
2013-01-13 15:37:51	supersymmetry	yeah that would work
2013-01-13 15:38:26	supersymmetry	you just block out the access to anyone who doesn't have a proper session token
2013-01-13 15:38:37	supersymmetry	you could even do it like github does
2013-01-13 15:39:05	supersymmetry	seems the proper thing is that automated tools send auth data in the http header every time
2013-01-13 15:39:42	supersymmetry	to auth, while as a use you'd be more inclined to use a (limited access) but more long living token
2013-01-13 15:39:44	ashnur	?
2013-01-13 15:40:05	ashnur	i am not sure i want to read all that back to know what you are talking about :D
2013-01-13 15:40:19	alexkaare	login areas with docpad
2013-01-13 15:40:23	supersymmetry	any apps you hook up like github with dillinger or scriptogr.am with dropbox
2013-01-13 15:40:31	supersymmetry	essentially they all work the same
2013-01-13 15:40:57	ashnur	balupton had some login stuff 
2013-01-13 15:41:18	ashnur	i did nothing auth related 
2013-01-13 15:41:19	supersymmetry	you authenticate once using username/password or by using a pub/private key pair that you let be known to anyone public (like ssh rsa)
2013-01-13 15:42:19	supersymmetry	and with the token you recieve a hashcode from the server back, and have a sessionid against which you can test
2013-01-13 15:42:50	supersymmetry	https://github.com/settings/applications
2013-01-13 15:44:10	supersymmetry	like there, i have e.g. Cloud9 create gists, access private repositories, and update ALL user data
2013-01-13 15:45:48	supersymmetry	all I had to do was confirm, after sending the first, with the second app that it was ok
2013-01-13 15:45:57	supersymmetry	untill i revoke the permissions
2013-01-13 15:46:15	supersymmetry	wether this kind of approach suites you, I honestly don't know
2013-01-13 15:47:22	supersymmetry	but you'd do good spending a few hours reeading up on these approaches and draw down the contours of what you need/want exactly
2013-01-13 15:47:46	alexkaare	I guess I would like to send people a username and password to access a restricted area
2013-01-13 15:47:59	supersymmetry	the 'simple' auth from my admin days was http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_auth_basic.html
2013-01-13 15:48:31	supersymmetry	yeah,...so a session token in a cookie
2013-01-13 15:49:13	supersymmetry	where did you want to store the user profile data in?
2013-01-13 15:49:58	alexkaare	dont mind really
2013-01-13 15:51:33	supersymmetry	well in theory you could even do it all in 1 text file :P
2013-01-13 15:52:07	alexkaare	thats fine
2013-01-13 15:54:27	supersymmetry	but then again
2013-01-13 15:54:55	supersymmetry	you might want to spend a significant amount of time on looking if there is existing express middleware
2013-01-13 15:55:32	supersymmetry	i havent designed a server side form really yet in ages... but there must be more then enough to get you going at least
2013-01-13 15:55:50	supersymmetry	also with the auth -> permissions part
2013-01-13 15:56:08	supersymmetry	and how to more fine-grain the access if you need to
2013-01-13 15:56:33	supersymmetry	or do you want everyone to be totally free after 1 user/pass
2013-01-13 15:56:49	supersymmetry	everyone same (none) rights meaning you can just see everything
2013-01-13 15:57:45	supersymmetry	makes it a lot easier, but damn simple scheme (none) so obviously
2013-01-13 15:59:58	alexkaare	yeah everyone totally free after login
2013-01-13 16:03:41	supersymmetry	yeah so like you showed me, http://stackoverflow.com/a/7879466 thats half the puzzle
2013-01-13 16:04:43	supersymmetry	also check the next post there
2013-01-13 16:04:54	supersymmetry	A very simple authentication with connect
2013-01-13 16:05:19	supersymmetry	if you dont like or 'get' the examples at first, look for some that are better/more clear
2013-01-13 16:07:21	supersymmetry	https://github.com/ciaranj/connect-auth/wiki/creating-a-form-based-strategy
2013-01-13 16:07:46	supersymmetry	tons of info on teh web :)

2013-01-14 00:42:54	Topcat	You know meta stuff at the top of say, a markdown document. can I pre set some default ones so you could put any *.md in documents/ and it would default say layout: 'custom' title: firstTitleLogic
2013-01-14 00:49:01	supersym	you'd have to write a cli script
2013-01-14 00:49:19	supersym	and just parse it to the file using like a here-doc would be easiest
2013-01-14 00:49:42	supersym	docpad does not listen for file creation i think
2013-01-14 00:50:07	supersym	livereload listens only to save while running if im not mistaken
2013-01-14 00:50:28	supersym	or use like a plain old `cp` command :P
2013-01-14 00:51:27	supersym	i dont even really use much aliases in my distros even
2013-01-14 00:51:35	supersym	thats how little typing effort it is :)
2013-01-14 00:51:59	supersym	though my oh-my-zsh does offer some handy ones in plugins ;)
2013-01-14 00:52:13	supersym	but that one a side note :P
2013-01-14 00:59:39	Topcat	I don't mind not being able to do that while docpad is running, on generate is fine. It'd be nice to not have to add that meta data to the top of all the files in documents if it's all the same.
2013-01-14 01:03:44	supersym	hmm well I guess you may have a pt there
2013-01-14 01:04:05	supersym	although i think atm it will just error
2013-01-14 01:04:10	supersym	if your file is empty
2013-01-14 01:04:53	supersym	there are some core essential topics ppl have discussions going on a bout i think
2013-01-14 01:05:19	supersym	so its always a question if something would make it to the core code base
2013-01-14 01:05:29	supersym	but feel free to hack your own installation

2013-01-14 08:58:16	ashnur	i guess not
2013-01-14 10:54:16	supersym	and? i could when using Jade but that language doesn't depend on curly braces
2013-01-14 11:08:07	ashnur	?
2013-01-14 11:08:21	ashnur	i don't understand what you just wrote :-S
2013-01-14 11:10:43	supersym	i could use partials using jade
2013-01-14 11:11:05	supersym	but haml uses %element{attr: => "", ..} notation doesnt it?
2013-01-14 11:11:22	supersym	and since you need to feed the partion a JS object at least
2013-01-14 11:11:42	supersym	also I don't know how haml syntax is escaped
2013-01-14 11:12:08	supersym	or if it has buffering like jade/coffeekup does

2013-01-14 11:12:34	supersym	!= partial('name', { }) was all I had to do in Jade
2013-01-14 11:13:10	supersym	Code buffered by = is escaped by default for security, however to output unescaped return values you may use !=
2013-01-14 11:13:34	supersym	so it renders the return HTNL uninterrupted
2013-01-14 11:13:38	supersym	*html
2013-01-14 11:14:44	ashnur	i don't really understand what you are talking about. I mean, i understand, I just don't see how relevant is to my issue which is to use haml with partials where I can do everything what I could with coffeekup for example
2013-01-14 11:15:09	ashnur	i asked if that plugin can do these things then i realized that it proably can not. 
2013-01-14 11:15:18	ashnur	now

2013-01-14 11:15:57	ashnur	why the hell is docpad telling me that my plugin doesn't have isEnabled() method, when I am extending the BasePlugin (which has it)
2013-01-14 11:17:21	designaholic	hello, has someone an example for a multi-lingual menu-structure?
2013-01-14 11:18:07	ashnur	not me

2013-01-14 11:37:19	supersym	x
2013-01-14 11:38:49	ashnur	no bindEvents either
2013-01-14 11:39:13	ashnur	maybe i have a very old docpad in this app?
2013-01-14 11:39:18	ashnur	i am doing an npm install
2013-01-14 11:43:03	ashnur	doesn't frikin help
2013-01-14 11:43:08	ashnur	i am getting scared
2013-01-14 11:52:56	ashnur	found it
2013-01-14 11:53:04	ashnur	frikin typo in the extend function
2013-01-14 11:53:47	supersym	@ashnur: ok - sorry i thought you 'wanted to use partials in haml' :P
2013-01-14 11:54:34	supersym	and im going crazy sometimes as well with stuff acting up on me but essentially I just find myself lacking the proper knowledge of a specific implementation :P
2013-01-14 11:54:54	supersym	atm coffeescript namespaces that refuse to work on the server
2013-01-14 11:55:07	supersym	documentation is extremely poor, everyone leaves out pieces
2013-01-14 11:55:31	supersym	so stupid. just like ppl who publish apps but 'forget' installation details
2013-01-14 11:55:46	ashnur	i do want to use partials in haml :)
2013-01-14 11:56:07	ashnur	i just don't know why you are telling me that it works in jade :)
2013-01-14 11:56:25	supersym	because if you have a haml equivalent, that could work?
2013-01-14 11:56:35	ashnur	?
2013-01-14 11:56:40	supersym	as partials also  use in eco and coffeeku[
2013-01-14 11:56:55	supersym	rly...i should stop trying to explain stuff LOL
2013-01-14 11:57:07	ashnur	i am switching from coffeekup to something more sane
2013-01-14 11:57:08	supersym	mis-comms day 
2013-01-14 11:57:12	supersym	haha
2013-01-14 11:57:14	ashnur	eco is something i don't want to use
2013-01-14 11:57:17	supersym	;)
2013-01-14 11:57:20	supersym	so use jade
2013-01-14 11:57:28	ashnur	i like how haml looks
2013-01-14 11:57:30	supersym	ditch the stupid % and {: => }
2013-01-14 11:57:32	supersym	ok
2013-01-14 11:57:39	supersym	i can understand that too
2013-01-14 11:57:52	ashnur	jade is soo frikin big :(
2013-01-14 11:58:45	supersym	haml.js (http://goo.gl/wRDgq)14 (13%)
2013-01-14 11:58:45	supersym	jade (http://goo.gl/6i3vu)89 (86%)
2013-01-14 11:58:58	supersym	linkedin vote under front-end developers :)
2013-01-14 11:59:02	ashnur	also in jade you have to mark content specially and in haml you mark the tags and what is unmarked is content
2013-01-14 11:59:03	supersym	just FYI...
2013-01-14 11:59:09	supersym	it its just aesthetics tho
2013-01-14 11:59:17	supersym	big??
2013-01-14 11:59:20	supersym	as in?
2013-01-14 11:59:31	ashnur	linkedin vote? :D
2013-01-14 11:59:40	ashnur	like i am going to take seriously linkedin? :D
2013-01-14 11:59:46	ashnur	since when? :D
2013-01-14 11:59:48	supersym	haha
2013-01-14 11:59:55	supersym	same ppl who all use jquery yeah i know
2013-01-14 12:00:03	ashnur	and it's big. like i have to scroll a lot to get to the part which I am interested in
2013-01-14 12:00:23	supersym	ah you mean lines of code in your .jade file?
2013-01-14 12:00:23	ashnur	random people come and vouche for me
2013-01-14 12:00:33	supersym	or the documentation :P
2013-01-14 12:00:37	ashnur	like they have no idea if I know or don't some thing, but they still do it
2013-01-14 12:00:49	ashnur	supersym: no, i mean the github page
2013-01-14 12:00:55	supersym	alright
2013-01-14 12:00:55	ashnur	https://github.com/visionmedia/jade
2013-01-14 12:01:06	supersym	yeah its issues list is a bit worrying
2013-01-14 12:01:10	ashnur	anyway. i don't like too much haml either
2013-01-14 12:01:30	ashnur	but i've now started trying haml out
2013-01-14 12:01:43	ashnur	i will try untill i get fed up, and then go further
2013-01-14 12:02:12	ashnur	i always try the most popular libs at last, because if not, i might get stucked just like i was with jquery which did not turned out too well
2013-01-14 12:02:41	ashnur	turn*
2013-01-14 12:03:09	ashnur	if i could move to some english speaking country for a few years, I would do it without hesitation
2013-01-14 12:03:26	ashnur	it's so annoying that i can write the stupides things fluently :(
2013-01-14 12:03:51	ashnur	yeah, and that | notation in jade is crazy. i can not like that
2013-01-14 12:04:01	ashnur	worst character

2013-01-14 12:31:04	ashnur	it give's me an error liek TypeError: Object #<Object> has no method 'split' and the file has a lot of split method calls in it, and of course when i compile it to js, the line number doesn't match up with ANY of those
2013-01-14 12:31:08	ashnur	so wtf^2

2013-01-14 12:55:08	supersym	ah that problem
2013-01-14 12:55:34	supersym	yeah experienced it too with .join on getTags() or something
2013-01-14 12:56:00	supersym	so you'd say the incorrect data-type is being passed along
2013-01-14 12:56:11	supersym	im digging into node.js error handling atm
2013-01-14 12:56:20	supersym	actually coincidental :P
2013-01-14 12:56:44	supersym	there are no good framework/libraries to facilitate graceful OOP based exception handling
2013-01-14 12:56:59	supersym	so I experiment a bit extending on the Error type
2013-01-14 12:57:35	supersym	I would really like to better be able to pinpoint the (lines) area of the problem
2013-01-14 12:57:49	supersym	without having to scroll up a huge buffer of stackdumps
2013-01-14 12:58:02	supersym	well in ruby i find it even worse
2013-01-14 12:58:07	supersym	but we can do so much better
2013-01-14 12:58:46	supersym	also if you'd properly work it out, could offer a 'hyperlink' from the console error -> the file editor at the correct line of the bug somewhere
2013-01-14 12:58:54	supersym	but maybe thats just my fetish
2013-01-14 12:59:04	supersym	async callbacks dont make that easier either
2013-01-14 12:59:19	supersym	you really need a IcedCoffeeScript approach I fear
2013-01-14 13:03:02	ashnur	??
2013-01-14 13:07:01	supersym	oops...i was supposed to stop mumbojumbo :P

2013-01-14 16:25:17	supersym	never investigated the cause of docpad skeleton not functioning with it
2013-01-14 16:25:27	supersym	all it did was show/hide the source code
2013-01-14 16:27:22	supersym	i guess i could take a closer look now, tired of crafting my ultimate toplist anyway
2013-01-14 16:30:24	Dreea	that is awesome, thanks for the feedback! I tried it on 3 browsers and installed it on 2 different servers, I thought it was me doing something wrong

2013-01-14 16:53:27	supersym	well it doesnt seem intended for inline edit?
2013-01-14 16:53:34	supersym	but im sure it was advertised somewhere

2013-01-14 16:55:09	supersym	also I can't find a reference in the source code from the browser that has a js or native HTML5 editable element
2013-01-14 16:55:44	supersym	aka 'it's not a textarea , you cant edit the pre element'
2013-01-14 16:56:21	supersym	doesnt seem like any injection/dom manipulation going on that would facilitate inline edit of the snippets
2013-01-14 16:56:44	supersym	for the record now i look at index.html from skeleton  kitchensink

2013-01-14 17:05:30	Dreea	ah, sorry you were saying what it should contain
2013-01-14 17:05:31	supersym	no html5 dom element attrib being set
2013-01-14 17:05:55	Dreea	ok
2013-01-14 17:05:55	supersym	if you select some text inside the snippet and do a rightclick -> view source
2013-01-14 17:06:12	supersym	you zoom in to that element in the html doc source
2013-01-14 17:06:40	supersym	just keep watching it because it updates computed styles realtime if they're being injected into the tree
2013-01-14 17:07:06	supersym	(for fun watch a svg animation in the browser source code, if it has motion)
2013-01-14 17:07:28	supersym	then i pressed first alt+shift+e and same ctrk
2013-01-14 17:07:33	supersym	*ctrl
2013-01-14 17:08:42	supersym	it doesnt do anything
2013-01-14 17:08:57	Dreea	ok
2013-01-14 17:09:12	supersym	the html document has the following assets
2013-01-14 17:09:27	supersym	(check resources tab of the source viewer)
2013-01-14 17:10:08	supersym	neither of those support a "contenteditable" specific method it seems...
2013-01-14 17:10:18	Dreea	what I would like to see is at least a sample of user content being added/edited/retrieved doesn't have to be inline edit 
2013-01-14 17:10:21	supersym	the script.js file
2013-01-14 17:10:42	supersym	huh?
2013-01-14 17:11:01	supersym	than just use your text editor????
2013-01-14 17:11:14	Dreea	:)
2013-01-14 17:11:15	supersym	sublime, vim, wordperfect whateveer
2013-01-14 17:11:24	Dreea	yes, I know
2013-01-14 17:11:35	supersym	if u have socket.io/livereload and u save it, it changes content :P
2013-01-14 17:11:43	Dreea	I was thinking more like user content, not my content
2013-01-14 17:11:55	supersym	aha
2013-01-14 17:12:16	supersym	now thats a whole different thing :P

2013-01-14 17:12:37	Dreea	is there any way I could do that? do you know?
2013-01-14 17:12:41	supersym	sure
2013-01-14 17:12:56	Dreea	I assume it would work the same way, it would write files on disk 
2013-01-14 17:13:06	supersym	either using file uploads or temp in browser cache
2013-01-14 17:13:13	supersym	html5 offers some support
2013-01-14 17:13:25	supersym	or push stuff anon to say gist
2013-01-14 17:13:29	supersym	if it is textual data
2013-01-14 17:13:41	supersym	you'll prolly want to persist something anyway
2013-01-14 17:13:54	Dreea	yes
2013-01-14 17:14:09	supersym	or if you have a cloud node.js running instance
2013-01-14 17:14:19	supersym	just use that and fs.write :)
2013-01-14 17:14:36	Dreea	ok
2013-01-14 17:14:49	Dreea	this nifty seemed like a good start for what I wanted 
2013-01-14 17:14:50	supersym	got some node.js experience?
2013-01-14 17:15:01	supersym	well its easy
2013-01-14 17:15:05	Dreea	little
2013-01-14 17:15:13	supersym	you just use a html5 capable browser
2013-01-14 17:15:20	supersym	that implements the feature
2013-01-14 17:15:31	supersym	and write a tag to be contenteditable
2013-01-14 17:15:35	supersym	en voila
2013-01-14 17:15:40	Dreea	sounds easy
2013-01-14 17:15:50	Dreea	thank you for the pointers
2013-01-14 17:15:51	supersym	but if you want to persist aka make it permanent
2013-01-14 17:15:59	supersym	then you'll need to store it somewhere
2013-01-14 17:16:19	supersym	over multiple pages but still temporary you can easily use localstorage also native html5
2013-01-14 17:16:35	supersym	or use a cookie
2013-01-14 17:16:48	supersym	to store simple string/integer data
2013-01-14 17:17:00	supersym	to save it to that users local computer
2013-01-14 17:17:29	supersym	if you want it to be written to the server, from the client, you will need to send it some way and then store the data
2013-01-14 17:17:40	supersym	depending on what you want, it could get a bit compler
2013-01-14 17:17:43	supersym	*complexer
2013-01-14 17:18:12	supersym	see docpad is part a static site generator / content management system
2013-01-14 17:18:12	Dreea	ok, on the server
2013-01-14 17:18:36	supersym	that works on development time compiled pre-processing template languages for the web
2013-01-14 17:19:19	supersym	aka it converts/renders those input files once and outputs HTML/CSS/JS
2013-01-14 17:19:29	supersym	to the out/ folder
2013-01-14 17:19:39	supersym	which can be hosted by any (static) http server
2013-01-14 17:19:57	supersym	apache, or http-server, express, iis whatever
2013-01-14 17:20:26	supersym	but it also has docpad-server taking up that role
2013-01-14 17:20:47	supersym	so if you install your docpad to say heroku or nodejitsu
2013-01-14 17:21:06	supersym	you'll have a fine-tunable instance running in the cloud
2013-01-14 17:21:49	supersym	and could handle say serving up raw jade/stylus files and render them as the web route (like myserver/index.html) being requested
2013-01-14 17:21:58	supersym	the MVC way
2013-01-14 17:22:35	supersym	would be to have docpad as a module of express js with connect middleware for a really dynamic site
2013-01-14 17:23:31	supersym	once you are able to process these things like HTTP Verbs (GET, POST etc) properly on the server side, you'll know enough how to process any users doing requests like writing a file :)
2013-01-14 17:23:36	Dreea	ok, I will look into this
2013-01-14 17:23:46	supersym	ofc
2013-01-14 17:23:57	Dreea	yes, exactly
2013-01-14 17:24:24	supersym	know that any file/dir write permissions consistute a security risk in essence and you should always properly validate the content and source of things
2013-01-14 17:26:52	supersym	dont under-estimate the number of possible angles one could follow
2013-01-14 17:27:14	supersym	just make sure to check for any node.js implementations or Express setups covering the same problem
2013-01-14 17:27:36	supersym	and see how those ppl solved the problem and if you could work/live with that path
2013-01-14 17:28:35	supersym	ofc the more paranoid/vital the machine (resources) are
2013-01-14 17:28:42	supersym	the more effort that takes :D
2013-01-14 17:33:31	Dreea	ok
2013-01-14 17:33:37	Dreea	yes :)

2013-01-14 17:40:53	supersym	that or perhaps there is a anonymous uploading service/site running anywhere
2013-01-14 17:41:13	supersym	i guess if many ppl also would need to access that user client uploaded content
2013-01-14 17:41:34	supersym	you'd might be able to use a CDN and save yourself/paas the bandwidth
2013-01-14 17:41:51	supersym	and avoid exposing your own server machine internals
2013-01-14 17:42:22	supersym	e.g. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coral_Content_Distribution_Network
2013-01-14 17:42:58	supersym	or have another free account say at redhat OpenShift dedicated for uploads of files
2013-01-14 17:43:09	supersym	although better then gists
2013-01-14 17:43:24	supersym	you'll still be limited in the file size, bandwidth allocation etc
2013-01-14 17:43:35	supersym	but i like free-free as Im dutch
2013-01-14 17:44:08	supersym	coral might be more up my alley, if you offer those files as a paid service that must be guaranteed
2013-01-14 17:44:13	supersym	at all costs
2013-01-14 17:44:33	supersym	you might want to start paying someone else to ensure you sleep safe
2013-01-14 18:23:01	Dreea	thanks a lot for all your help
2013-01-14 18:35:40	supersym	sure np :)
2013-01-14 18:36:50	supersym	https://github.com/felixge/node-formidable
2013-01-14 18:37:18	supersym	check that out for example... it looks good
2013-01-14 18:37:21	supersym	battle-tested against hundreds of GB of file uploads from a large variety of clients and is considered production-ready.
2013-01-14 18:37:38	supersym	if you are serious about your uploading aspirations :D

2013-01-14 21:14:59	qwebirc88331	someone here i need some help with querying files
2013-01-14 21:16:15	qwebirc88331	i got a problem with the api on express i am trying this:
2013-01-14 21:16:18	qwebirc88331	app.get('/blog/:title',function(req,res,next){ 	req.templateData = { 		weDidSomeCustomRendering: true 	} 	var path = '/posts/'+req.params.title+'.html'; 	var doc = docpadInstance.getFile({relativePath: path}); 	console.log(doc); });
2013-01-14 21:16:35	qwebirc88331	but document is always saying me null
2013-01-14 21:18:04	ashnur	hekki to you too qwebirc88331 
2013-01-14 21:19:50	ashnur	documents saying null? what do you mean by that?
2013-01-14 21:22:00	qwebirc88331	ok i am querying one file
2013-01-14 21:22:11	qwebirc88331	and doing console.log(doc)
2013-01-14 21:22:23	qwebirc88331	to watch if a document was retrieved
2013-01-14 21:22:47	qwebirc88331	but docpadInstance.getFile({relativePath: path});  always return me null
2013-01-14 21:26:18	qwebirc88331	here you can see my code https://gist.github.com/4533070
2013-01-14 21:28:17	qwebirc88331	I am doing, a express server when i go asdasd.com/blog/post
2013-01-14 21:28:28	qwebirc88331	its serve the document post.html
2013-01-14 21:29:02	qwebirc88331	but docpadInstance.getFile() isnt returning the document, it returns me null :S!

2013-01-14 21:30:38	ashnur	what do you have in the path variable?
2013-01-14 21:30:42	ashnur	other queries work?
2013-01-14 21:31:21	qwebirc88331	var path = '/posts/'+req.params.title+'.html';
2013-01-14 21:32:12	ashnur	that is not what I am asking, do a console.log(path)
2013-01-14 21:32:49	ashnur	and see if other queries work or not, otherwise you can't be sure if you are messing things up, or it is a configuration or some other issue. you have to narrow it down, no?
2013-01-14 21:32:58	ashnur	at least that's what I would do
2013-01-14 21:34:04	qwebirc88331	yeah i tried
2013-01-14 21:34:14	qwebirc88331	{isPage: true}
2013-01-14 21:34:17	qwebirc88331	doesnt worked
2013-01-14 21:34:45	qwebirc88331	path returned me /posts/usingdocpad.html
2013-01-14 21:35:19	qwebirc88331	my file is src/documents/posts/usindocpad.html
2013-01-14 21:35:47	ashnur	that is not the same
2013-01-14 21:35:51	ashnur	and if it doesn't work
2013-01-14 21:35:59	ashnur	not even with other queries
2013-01-14 21:36:09	ashnur	you might want to see other examples of it
2013-01-14 21:36:47	qwebirc88331	where can i find some examples ??
2013-01-14 21:37:14	qwebirc88331	but relativepath isnt the pat relative to documents folder?
2013-01-14 21:42:59	ashnur	i don't know what relativePath is
2013-01-14 21:43:14	ashnur	there are not many examples for queries, that's true
2013-01-14 21:43:39	ashnur	i usually go through the source of docpad to see how it is used
2013-01-14 21:43:51	ashnur	or check the source of queryengine itself

2013-01-14 21:46:34	Rolilink	actually i am following this same example on documentation
2013-01-14 21:47:00	Rolilink	Here is some code for manually rendering a document (documents are files inside src/documents) with a custom route:  app.get '/alias-for-home', (req,res,next) ->     req.templateData = {         weDidSomeCustomRendering: true     };     var document = docpadInstance.getFile({relativePath:'home.html.md'});     docpadInstance.serveDocument({document,req,res,next});
2013-01-14 21:58:47	ashnur	i don't really use express like this, i use the docpad-server which comes with docpad

2013-01-14 22:01:45	Rolilink	just solved myself
2013-01-14 22:02:04	Rolilink	has to start the action watch, so docPad can see the files thanks :)!
2013-01-14 22:02:52	ashnur	hmm
2013-01-14 22:02:55	ashnur	dont get it
2013-01-14 22:03:04	ashnur	but it's good that you could solve it
2013-01-14 22:06:17	alexkaare	what do you guys fin best

2013-01-14 22:06:25	alexkaare	find*
2013-01-14 22:06:47	alexkaare	i noticed balupton like coffeekup
2013-01-14 22:07:17	supersym	i use jade when i can
2013-01-14 22:07:34	supersym	cleanest possible html subset in terms of character amount used
2013-01-14 22:07:54	supersym	haml is the more verbose, sometimes safer one

2013-01-14 22:09:04	ashnur	i want to use hamlcoffee, but it's annoyingly difficult for me to get it done
2013-01-14 22:09:10	supersym	also eco is a good choice if you want the most example code from docpad doucmentation
2013-01-14 22:09:14	 *	ashnur is frustrated
2013-01-14 22:09:58	supersym	also i like jade filters and blocks and substitution, buffering, imports etc
2013-01-14 22:10:06	supersym	all features haml doesnt have
2013-01-14 22:10:32	supersym	and stylus of course
2013-01-14 22:10:40	supersym	only real drawback for many ppl
2013-01-14 22:10:40	alexkaare	stylus for css?
2013-01-14 22:10:47	alexkaare	:)

2013-01-14 22:11:51	supersym	a few weeks into node/js i feel really comfortable with functional programming, the DOM, asynchronous code execution etc
2013-01-14 22:12:13	supersym	you might wanna remote folder share them
2013-01-14 22:12:14	iammerrick	I was thinking the express mounting but if I could just hook into docpad's server that would be even better.
2013-01-14 22:12:20	supersym	or use dropbox
2013-01-14 22:12:22	ashnur	stylus is good
2013-01-14 22:12:30	supersym	but their static file host is muahmuah

2013-01-14 22:13:05	supersym	@ashnur: what changed?
2013-01-14 22:13:23	iammerrick	alexkaare: Unfortunately, following the express docs to a T it launches a docpad server on its own host still. :-(
2013-01-14 22:13:37	supersym	well ofc you could i guess
2013-01-14 22:13:56	supersym	share any folder with the correct unix file permissions (on nix/mac)

2013-01-14 22:17:46	alexkaare	i came to node because of docpad
2013-01-14 22:17:56	alexkaare	was using ruby solutions before
2013-01-14 22:18:16	alexkaare	so still playing catchup
2013-01-14 22:19:25	supersym	luckily it'll go a lot faster
2013-01-14 22:19:39	supersym	less debugging apps n shit with dependencies
2013-01-14 22:19:54	supersym	npm, although gems and rvm are cool, just is better
2013-01-14 22:20:34	supersym	its not that hard, you'll have to hook to the server extend event and expose the docpad instance to the express instance

2013-01-14 22:24:08	alexkaare	i'll have a read
2013-01-14 22:30:00	supersym	basically call express.createServer() method which returns a server instance of express and then feed that as object to the associative array that is docpadConfig (object of objects)
2013-01-14 22:31:03	supersym	instead of running docpad-server process we run the express dynamic routing server

2013-01-14 22:32:17	supersym	Called just while we are setting up the server, and just before the DocPad routes are applied. Used to extend the server with routes that will be triggered before the DocPad routes. Options:
2013-01-14 22:32:17	supersym	server the express.js server instance we are usin

2013-01-14 23:22:26	supersym	OK,Docpad was Initialized
2013-01-14 23:22:26	supersym	using server routes from express for docpad
2013-01-14 23:22:41	supersym	thats the custom routes hook being triggered
2013-01-14 23:23:21	supersym	what i did was just $ cd `mktemp -d` && npm i docpad express
2013-01-14 23:25:22	supersym	then i first ensured express working doing the first steps in their tutorial for HTTP verbs after which I replaced app.js and created server.coffee as george-osd describes
2013-01-14 23:25:54	supersym	also: (inside the tmp dir root) $ docpad skeleton 
2013-01-14 23:26:15	supersym	and i just used the empty one but any would work
2013-01-14 23:27:05	supersym	because my docpad was empty I just manually copied src/layout/default.html.eco and docpad.coffee from a skeleton
2013-01-14 23:27:17	supersym	and replaced the docpad.coffee events part with this
2013-01-14 23:27:34	supersym	https://gist.github.com/3695936 the above snippet
2013-01-14 23:27:38	supersym	and added the routes.coffee
2013-01-14 23:28:39	supersym	i did a empty file placement in src/files using touch src/files/somefile.txt and it renders a new out/ directory with that file
2013-01-14 23:29:16	supersym	I'll hook up some documents with layout default now

2013-01-14 23:50:15	supersym	ok i guess i am missing something on the oldurls
2013-01-14 23:50:22	supersym	but everything seems to work ok
2013-01-14 23:50:41	supersym	now this was hooked up without any use of skeletons or binaries besides npm
2013-01-14 23:50:57	supersym	if i understand correctly
2013-01-14 23:51:12	supersym	its also just fine to use 'express' command to generate a express project
2013-01-14 23:51:48	supersym	spawn a docpad process/instance, have that function run as a function under express server
2013-01-14 23:51:51	supersym	and also control docpad
2013-01-14 23:52:13	alexkaare	ok i'm playing with it now
2013-01-14 23:52:16	supersym	while here we created a express running instance using the variable docpadServer = express()
2013-01-14 23:52:24	supersym	have fun ;)
2013-01-14 23:52:37	alexkaare	:D
2013-01-14 23:53:09	supersym	imma go try and hack/sniff around a friends new ps vita
2013-01-14 23:53:44	supersym	now all i did was etherape my network but he thinks im kicking him off....i swear its not me but i guess i need to checkout my routers dd-wrt 
2013-01-14 23:54:05	alexkaare	cool
2013-01-14 23:54:18	alexkaare	have fun
2013-01-14 23:59:04	supersym	sigh nothing i did ofc..just him thinking the damn thing was not connected

2013-01-15 00:18:58	supersym	you should read that, shares some of the concerns I also had with delegating certain services to just any cloud app instance
2013-01-15 00:19:12	supersym	if you build too heavily around it, and they change the api
2013-01-15 00:19:16	supersym	or go broke
2013-01-15 00:19:28	supersym	or want you to cough up money
2013-01-15 00:19:47	supersym	anyway... just as long as none of the core functionality depends on these things
2013-01-15 00:20:42	supersym	and perhaps when 2 or more api's are suitable, you could just do automated backups of say gist also to github (versioning) and say evernote or dropbox or
2013-01-15 00:24:42	alexkaare	ok so i'm using serverExtend
2013-01-15 00:24:55	alexkaare	and i've added some requires
2013-01-15 00:25:25	alexkaare	which build fine
2013-01-15 00:25:48	alexkaare	but in the passport example they have things like app.use(express.cookieParser());
2013-01-15 00:26:27	supersym	yeah instead you do server.use
2013-01-15 00:26:30	alexkaare	but i'm using docpads express server instance
2013-01-15 00:26:37	supersym	as the server object is passed
2013-01-15 00:26:45	alexkaare	yeah i got the server.use bit
2013-01-15 00:27:12	alexkaare	but do i need to add express as a dependancy even though i'm using docpads express server?
2013-01-15 00:27:25	supersym	docpad doesnt have a 'express server'
2013-01-15 00:27:48	supersym	what you did was first require, thus creating a express module import of those it exposes
2013-01-15 00:27:49	alexkaare	https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/docpad/DD1AtiUv0_E/ai9cV1Jn3_AJ
2013-01-15 00:28:02	supersym	after which you can instantiate the express server
2013-01-15 00:28:25	alexkaare	so i need to add express to package.json
2013-01-15 00:28:31	alexkaare	and then require it?
2013-01-15 00:28:41	supersym	using express() - used to be createServer
2013-01-15 00:29:16	supersym	express = require 'express'
2013-01-15 00:29:20	supersym	in docpad.coffee
2013-01-15 00:29:32	supersym	which automatically gets run when you fire up docpad
2013-01-15 00:29:46	supersym	(could also be .cson or .js or .json)
2013-01-15 00:29:54	supersym	it regocnizes all
2013-01-15 00:30:10	supersym	so you do a ./server.coffee (if you made that file executable)
2013-01-15 00:30:19	supersym	which requires docpad and express
2013-01-15 00:30:58	supersym	then you pass some config top level variables like cache expiration offset and what not
2013-01-15 00:31:02	supersym	i dont think its a must
2013-01-15 00:31:43	supersym	then you create a new variable called docpadServer but its just a name, set to express()
2013-01-15 00:31:56	supersym	setup a docpadConfig object with params
2013-01-15 00:32:06	supersym	docpad.createInstance docpadConfig, (err,docpadInstance) ->
2013-01-15 00:32:07	alexkaare	so you basically create a basic express app
2013-01-15 00:32:11	supersym	but only *there*
2013-01-15 00:32:11	alexkaare	and add docpad to it
2013-01-15 00:32:21	supersym	we first create a docpad instance
2013-01-15 00:33:29	supersym	and have that read the docpadConfig which contains the express() generated instance of express server
2013-01-15 00:34:22	supersym	so you could check this by simply putting a console.out 'some msg..' anywhere around the node_modules/express/.. library files
2013-01-15 00:34:34	supersym	particulary the module.exports stuff

2013-01-15 00:37:57	supersym	exports = module.exports = createApplication;

2013-01-15 00:38:55	supersym	when in doubt: the source code is your friend
2013-01-15 00:39:17	supersym	just also keep in mind that not all packages get their source files published to npm 
2013-01-15 00:39:35	supersym	so like docpad, you'd want to clone the github.com/bevry/docpad repo
2013-01-15 00:39:55	supersym	because it has coffee files at src/.. that you don't get under node_modules/docpad
2013-01-15 00:40:22	supersym	so baluptons build process involves automated compile of stuff under src/ to lib/ or out/

2013-01-15 09:52:22	supersym	I'm tired of copy pasting the same stuff all over again from wikipedia... for example, the first paragraphs 99/100 times always very properly describes a term
2013-01-15 09:52:37	supersym	and you can also do wordnet searches for synonyms and meaning
2013-01-15 09:53:07	supersym	go fetch me that sh!t for any (jargon) terms you found in my description
2013-01-15 09:53:52	supersym	and nearly after or during the whole 'inquiry' process of stdout/stdin Q&A game, has stored the API/DB feedback in some file structure
2013-01-15 09:54:10	supersym	it'll save me tons of time
2013-01-15 09:55:42	supersym	see for me, unlike AI linguistical geeks, it doesnt have to be 'perfect' in many facets, i'll be happy with a crude approach
2013-01-15 09:56:39	supersym	the devil is in the details, and how much you want to constraint on the return data
2013-01-15 09:56:54	supersym	and if its even supported by that data source query language
2013-01-15 09:57:21	supersym	and it'll require 'intimate working knowledge' of these kinds of things like YQL
2013-01-15 10:00:22	ashnur	i think Watson does something like this :)
2013-01-15 10:00:27	supersym	ah
2013-01-15 10:00:38	supersym	sweet...i know the name but not really what it does
2013-01-15 10:00:42	supersym	imma check it out :)
2013-01-15 10:01:33	ashnur	IBM's Watson? you never heard of it? :)
2013-01-15 10:01:37	supersym	i just know i like to be as 'complete' as possible in providing information and knowing the landscape I operate in to save time on useless persuits :P
2013-01-15 10:02:02	supersym	no i havent actually
2013-01-15 10:02:26	supersym	Watson understands natural language, breaking down the barrier between people and machines.
2013-01-15 10:02:28	supersym	there we go
2013-01-15 10:03:22	ashnur	beat the shit out of anyone in Jeopardy
2013-01-15 10:03:34	ashnur	it was a hype around it even in the mainstream media
2013-01-15 10:04:47	supersym	lo
2013-01-15 10:04:51	supersym	damn 
2013-01-15 10:05:22	supersym	i bet yeah... this stuff combined together is border-line scary
2013-01-15 10:05:38	supersym	yanks already use this to index the terrorist movements on the internet
2013-01-15 10:05:58	supersym	hooked up psych. profiles and everything iterating through social-networks and databases
2013-01-15 10:06:06	supersym	darknet or so i think its called
2013-01-15 10:06:36	supersym	the amount of facts you can deduct from circumstances... brr
2013-01-15 10:07:30	supersym	then again I wonder why.. not like they are really, really verifying that stuff before they send in drones :P
2013-01-15 10:07:46	supersym	which have malware btw that the top army geeks can't rid off
2013-01-15 10:08:09	supersym	actually found bearded dudes in the desert with laptops containing drone footage
2013-01-15 10:08:30	supersym	then again they didnt do data transmission (drones/army) over encrypted line ><
2013-01-15 10:09:03	supersym	them middle-ages sandppl arent as dumb as they may seem
2013-01-15 10:09:28	supersym	and their techies are guarded sometimes even with 100 warriors
2013-01-15 10:10:07	supersym	bomb makers and hackers are valuable assets in any modern (holy) war :)
2013-01-15 10:11:12	ashnur	i've heard on the radio the other day that mainstream marketing already uses software which listens to conversations between you and support staff, and gives advices to the staff when to offer new contracts, and things like that
2013-01-15 10:11:27	ashnur	phone conversations

2013-01-15 10:13:14	supersym	a female friend of mine is telesupport for mobile companies (and also have a google adwords branch)
2013-01-15 10:13:50	supersym	but they dont even have structured 'lists on how to deal with customers' that work
2013-01-15 10:14:03	supersym	writen by chinese, problems when switching it to dutch god knows
2013-01-15 10:14:21	supersym	they solely rely on cheap labour, bad service and harsh work time/clocking
2013-01-15 10:14:53	supersym	but yeah like you said, doesnt surprise me..any company in the netherlands phone option 1 = sales no wait time, rest = pay up!
2013-01-15 10:15:07	supersym	either in time, or cents per minute or both :P
2013-01-15 10:15:21	supersym	greedy corporate fcks
2013-01-15 10:15:33	supersym	if you let marketing boys get their way... low and behold

2013-01-15 10:18:02	supersym	but we gotta tell em sorry, we already used up everything
2013-01-15 10:18:06	ashnur	there is no such thing as "third world"

2013-01-15 10:45:53	ashnur	it should
2013-01-15 10:45:54	supersym	luckily not all are asleep
2013-01-15 10:46:13	supersym	Power is unequal in culture too. In terms of marketing communication, the result of inequality is that some ‘speakers’ are much more powerful than others. It’s not a question of ‘each member’ of a society using their individual voice, but about powerful, extensive alliances crafting the most insidiously persuasive messages they can – then using vast resources to hammer those messages home as
2013-01-15 10:46:13	supersym	forcefully as possible.
2013-01-15 10:46:25	ashnur	well. seeing something, and acting accordingly is two separate things 
2013-01-15 10:46:28	supersym	that is so well put/observed
2013-01-15 10:46:35	supersym	its hard
2013-01-15 10:46:37	supersym	because of that
2013-01-15 10:46:41	supersym	we get seduced

2013-01-15 10:47:00	supersym	even those who are aware, arent that 100% of the time
2013-01-15 10:47:29	supersym	how often do you buy stuff that you didnt want but subconsiously got tempted to?
2013-01-15 10:47:35	ashnur	never
2013-01-15 10:47:39	supersym	everything in the supermarket is thought out
2013-01-15 10:47:42	ashnur	i don't have much money
2013-01-15 10:47:44	supersym	for males in particular
2013-01-15 10:47:59	supersym	ok, not that its equally present for everyone
2013-01-15 10:48:15	supersym	but everyone does get subjected and will follow the carrot
2013-01-15 10:48:44	supersym	then again, being broke ass like us, you're less likely to consume much useless crap :P
2013-01-15 10:48:45	ashnur	anyway. i think that marketing should be regulated as money lending should be regulated 
2013-01-15 10:48:52	supersym	yup
2013-01-15 10:49:11	supersym	but in the USA its impossible to even talk automated-rigle restrictions
2013-01-15 10:49:19	supersym	or 5ct increase on gas
2013-01-15 10:49:25	ashnur	but i don't want to talk about it. the last year i spent with a small and new leftist party in hungary. i know everything and a lot more about the shit you have to do to change anything
2013-01-15 10:49:26	supersym	they'll start a riot
2013-01-15 10:49:36	ashnur	i should really focus only on my life now, nothing else
2013-01-15 10:49:40	supersym	ok
2013-01-15 10:49:42	ashnur	like how I am going to make any money
2013-01-15 10:49:45	supersym	sorry and i get that
2013-01-15 10:49:52	supersym	all the best with that :)
2013-01-15 10:50:01	ashnur	because i have like 100 euros, and no more. and no income whatsoever
2013-01-15 10:50:06	supersym	and in no means i sought out to be depressing :P
2013-01-15 10:50:25	supersym	are you hungarian?
2013-01-15 10:50:28	ashnur	luckily the family lets me stay here and gives me food. but it's not the best situation
2013-01-15 10:50:30	ashnur	yes
2013-01-15 10:50:34	supersym	i see
2013-01-15 10:51:08	supersym	and you do some freelance web development for a living now,..to the best extent?
2013-01-15 10:51:27	supersym	im still pondering if the freelance business will be right for me
2013-01-15 10:51:54	supersym	all i know many small business owners dont like to pay more than 500 euries for a site here

2013-01-15 10:52:55	ashnur	i am not working anything right now which would give me money
2013-01-15 10:53:38	supersym	although everyone is shouting we'll have a dire need for quality IT people...esp. those who know much about everything like us Archers do
2013-01-15 10:53:41	ashnur	i might have had some very small php projects, but i don't want to do php, i could waste months on them and get a few hundred dollars at most
2013-01-15 10:53:46	supersym	it sucks
2013-01-15 10:53:51	supersym	i know ppl who charge double
2013-01-15 10:53:55	supersym	and so will i in the future
2013-01-15 10:54:16	supersym	C# is acceptable tho but asp then again and iis do suck
2013-01-15 10:54:30	supersym	ruby was way to flawed and small in user-base
2013-01-15 10:54:34	ashnur	i don't know anything besides php and javascript
2013-01-15 10:54:37	supersym	so node.js was my logical choice
2013-01-15 10:54:40	ashnur	and of course sitebuilding
2013-01-15 10:54:51	supersym	not much more besides js you need to know in the future :)
2013-01-15 10:54:58	supersym	obviously
2013-01-15 10:55:22	ashnur	i know, that's why i learned it. but how to make money  from it in the short run?
2013-01-15 10:55:26	ashnur	like near future?
2013-01-15 10:55:28	supersym	trust me there will be enough companies asking for coffeescript ppl sooner
2013-01-15 10:55:30	ashnur	dunno yet
2013-01-15 10:55:35	supersym	yeah yeah
2013-01-15 10:55:37	supersym	same problem here
2013-01-15 10:55:45	supersym	the answer is....marketing :D

2013-01-15 10:56:01	supersym	my friend had a good business idea
2013-01-15 10:56:06	ashnur	the other thing is that i don't really want a monthly payment job. i've fed with those. it's just doing shit for idiots, mostly

2013-01-15 10:58:20	supersym	and im gonna make them for him
2013-01-15 10:59:09	supersym	i can also imagine, but thats perhaps a 'inner-circle' principle of outsourcing to online friends
2013-01-15 10:59:22	supersym	but if i'd have a good playing job with too much workload
2013-01-15 10:59:28	supersym	wouldnt mind handing over stuff :P
2013-01-15 10:59:52	supersym	IBAN and initial trust that any business transaction encompasses

2013-01-15 11:00:08	ashnur	i have friends who make good money for creating vector graphics for site like stockphotos and such
2013-01-15 11:00:24	supersym	why should i get a chinese team i dont know when a smart code-cutter like docpad ppl can do in 10% of the time
2013-01-15 11:00:34	supersym	oh yeah
2013-01-15 11:00:37	ashnur	but i don't really think this works for js too
2013-01-15 11:00:39	supersym	those do nicely as well
2013-01-15 11:00:55	supersym	yeah too much copy/paste already out there you mean?
2013-01-15 11:01:01	supersym	e.g. the jquery effect?
2013-01-15 11:01:08	ashnur	something like that, yes
2013-01-15 11:01:22	ashnur	you can't modify vector things that easily
2013-01-15 11:01:31	supersym	i get a lot of inquiries about maps, and SEO etc
2013-01-15 11:01:36	supersym	no me neither
2013-01-15 11:01:42	supersym	I just dont get illustrator etc
2013-01-15 11:01:47	ashnur	and i really don't like the concept of selling code for money. 
2013-01-15 11:02:04	supersym	i think there is a difference
2013-01-15 11:02:17	supersym	because what I am doing now with apps under MIT license
2013-01-15 11:02:32	supersym	is still mashing them up for a end-user purpose beyond its original scope
2013-01-15 11:03:08	supersym	e.g. much like unix command && chaining but with some customization to cmd1 && cmd2 to better pipe out the combined power of two
2013-01-15 11:03:15	supersym	not everyone can do tha
2013-01-15 11:03:17	supersym	*t
2013-01-15 11:03:30	supersym	heck... 90% of the web developers out there doesnt like coffeescript
2013-01-15 11:03:42	supersym	not because of those arguments on closure thats BS
2013-01-15 11:03:49	supersym	most of them dont have a fucking clue
2013-01-15 11:03:56	supersym	copy/paste
2013-01-15 11:04:18	supersym	they just can't switch back to js in their head in a natural language fashio
2013-01-15 11:04:43	ashnur	i don't like coffee
2013-01-15 11:04:53	supersym	elaborate pls?
2013-01-15 11:05:03	supersym	because i am loving it more and more
2013-01-15 11:05:10	ashnur	i've been using it daily, actively for half a year. then i watched the code it generated and got back to javascript
2013-01-15 11:06:02	supersym	i dont think there are any really much better solutions than how it is done now and the automatic return values is also part of its strength

2013-01-15 11:07:18	supersym	and love to model according to real world entities
2013-01-15 11:07:23	ashnur	the fact is that coffeescript is much harder to me than javascript. anything i think of, i do in js, then i want to write it in coffee, and i can't because the abstractions it uses are not like how i am thinking
2013-01-15 11:07:26	supersym	there is no clean way of doing that in JS
2013-01-15 11:07:35	supersym	well then dont use it
2013-01-15 11:07:39	supersym	I agree
2013-01-15 11:07:43	supersym	use what suits you best
2013-01-15 11:07:50	supersym	or your line of thinking that is
2013-01-15 11:07:53	ashnur	i don't like "classes", i miss ternary, i don't need to return stuff always, things like these 
2013-01-15 11:09:10	ashnur	when I am writin js, i know how to write a function in place, then refactor it without too much work. i can easily manipulate it. with coffeescript i often can't write what i want because it's not how it works
2013-01-15 11:09:28	supersym	yeah
2013-01-15 11:09:32	ashnur	so i have to go and check what else i could use, and usually there is nothing quite what I would like
2013-01-15 11:09:38	supersym	see i never had that JS experience
2013-01-15 11:09:47	supersym	hehe
2013-01-15 11:09:47	ashnur	so i waste a lot of time like this
2013-01-15 11:09:51	supersym	yup
2013-01-15 11:10:09	supersym	since most my time now i am outlining domains
2013-01-15 11:10:18	ashnur	and I really like my style of writing js. it's a style where i have rules for every damn whitespace, i don't have to think, just follow it.
2013-01-15 11:10:22	supersym	my choice for quick class A extends B does a better job 
2013-01-15 11:10:28	supersym	its whatever suits you/the job best
2013-01-15 11:10:39	supersym	for the rest i have nothing against JS
2013-01-15 11:10:45	ashnur	you cant do that with coffee. sometimes you need parens when other times you don't. 
2013-01-15 11:11:01	supersym	parens?
2013-01-15 11:11:06	ashnur	prentheses
2013-01-15 11:11:11	supersym	ah
2013-01-15 11:11:17	ashnur	can't type :(
2013-01-15 11:11:20	ashnur	you get it
2013-01-15 11:11:21	supersym	haha
2013-01-15 11:12:08	supersym	lol nitpicker :P so much alike in that sense, never good enough im afraid
2013-01-15 11:12:26	supersym	perfectionism is one of my major strengths and pitfalls
2013-01-15 11:12:45	supersym	but more often i feel its also about aesthetics for me
2013-01-15 11:13:05	supersym	reason i dont like python too much in that way is __init__ like variable identifiers
2013-01-15 11:13:12	supersym	*shrugs*

2013-01-15 11:14:08	ashnur	so, coffee is convenient in many ways, but i am not smart enough to be able to use it well. 
2013-01-15 11:14:27	supersym	pick one you like, almost everything has been tried in code languages already :)
2013-01-15 11:14:51	supersym	nah its not that but more customs and giving yourself time to get used to things
2013-01-15 11:15:05	supersym	cant remember how many times i tried to move from VB to C# just didnt get it
2013-01-15 11:15:41	supersym	never imagined JS to be so complex and dynamic and even less that i'd ever understand prototypes yet here we are i notice these patterns all the time
2013-01-15 11:16:01	supersym	and allowing myself to experiment a lot with trying out different paradigms and syntax
2013-01-15 11:16:19	ashnur	yeah. you know about continuum?
2013-01-15 11:16:23	supersym	really helps shape my mind in that respect of general programming knowledge and thinking
2013-01-15 11:16:27	supersym	nope
2013-01-15 11:16:33	supersym	never heard of it
2013-01-15 11:16:43	ashnur	benvie.github.com/continuum/
2013-01-15 11:17:04	supersym	wow
2013-01-15 11:17:13	ashnur	you should really spend more time in ##javascript 
2013-01-15 11:17:21	supersym	:D
2013-01-15 11:17:36	ashnur	there are some people like Benvie
2013-01-15 11:17:59	ashnur	i learn just by reading their conversations
2013-01-15 11:18:08	ashnur	and checking the stuff they do, trying to understand it
2013-01-15 11:18:16	supersym	cool
2013-01-15 11:18:19	supersym	yeah that works
2013-01-15 11:18:36	supersym	baluptons work on docpad learned me so much about techniques you could follow
2013-01-15 11:18:46	supersym	tho his commenting skills blow donkey-balls :P
2013-01-15 11:19:07	supersym	but i'd love to pick that up after I properly hashed through all documentation-tools issues
2013-01-15 11:19:32	supersym	then again, lack of comments led me back and back to the docpad source trying to grasp it
2013-01-15 11:19:42	supersym	untill you do (with certain, not all solutions)
2013-01-15 11:21:16	ashnur	if the code is good, comments are unnecessary, that's my view
2013-01-15 11:21:35	supersym	yeah but not everyones brain works this way and at a fast enough pace
2013-01-15 11:21:54	supersym	then again my only problem with doing a lot of work on documenting
2013-01-15 11:22:09	supersym	is the complete ignorance and stupidity of many end-users
2013-01-15 11:22:14	supersym	not to mention the laziness
2013-01-15 11:22:20	supersym	of googling stuff yourself
2013-01-15 11:22:32	supersym	even at work ppl keep asking you dumb questions
2013-01-15 11:22:47	supersym	you can watch online porn? good..you can google the answer yourself
2013-01-15 11:23:09	supersym	lookup football score? sure. google how to add a printer in windows? noooo too complicated
2013-01-15 11:23:10	supersym	my ass
2013-01-15 11:23:16	supersym	i dont buy that anymore
2013-01-15 11:23:22	ashnur	:)
2013-01-15 11:23:26	supersym	but its in their nature
2013-01-15 11:23:39	supersym	i had to re-educate my GF and some friends as well
2013-01-15 11:23:43	ashnur	:))
2013-01-15 11:23:48	supersym	her mother is the absolute worst
2013-01-15 11:24:07	ashnur	i've just waited some years and they got it without me telling them too much
2013-01-15 11:24:10	supersym	doesnt get anything and forgets what button i had her click on just 10 seconds earlier
2013-01-15 11:24:24	supersym	hehe
2013-01-15 11:24:30	ashnur	i mean, i don't think i've been telling them too much, but of course they DO think i've been telling them it too much to google stuff :D
2013-01-15 11:24:40	ashnur	but i really didn't :D
2013-01-15 11:25:34	supersym	my best friend messed up his laptop and data so i recovered it
2013-01-15 11:25:44	supersym	but instead of windows, i installed ubuntu and later arch
2013-01-15 11:32:36	ashnur	none of my friends require assistance with a windows reinstall
2013-01-15 11:33:53	ashnur	i told my father that if he wants me to help with his pc problems, i am going to install ubuntu 
2013-01-15 11:33:59	ashnur	he didn't like the idea
2013-01-15 11:34:18	ashnur	i convinced him anyways, and now he is a happy ubuntu user for more than a year 
2013-01-15 11:34:45	ashnur	of course he doesn't do much
2013-01-15 11:34:55	ashnur	emails, facebook, some games which work with wine perfectly

2013-01-15 14:20:24	Ed_	for example. If I want to put my website subheading in there, previously using the <t> tag worked for me (but that was with the config file in cson format)
2013-01-15 14:22:00	Ed_	the old example: http://pastebin.com/AeUhc1W2

2013-01-15 14:41:27	Ed_	read that (of course) - but what is the sytax for representing templateData in a string here
2013-01-15 14:42:09	Ed_	'This website was created with' + @links.bevry + '!'
2013-01-15 14:42:13	Ed_	that wont work
2013-01-15 14:42:31	Ed_	either will ruby syntax:
2013-01-15 14:43:10	Ed_	'This website was created with #{@links.docpad}!'
2013-01-15 15:11:18	ashnur	??
2013-01-15 15:11:45	ashnur	sry, i don't undersntad your issue
2013-01-15 15:14:44	Ed_	just concatenate the template data into a string
2013-01-15 15:15:04	Ed_	so that I can return something like 'this website was created with <a href="docpad">docpad !
2013-01-15 15:15:46	Ed_	when I call @site.footnote from my template
2013-01-15 15:17:10	ashnur	so you want to reference the object from itself? :)
2013-01-15 15:17:15	<--	zenorocha (~zenorocha@186.221.136.45) has quit (Remote host closed the connection)
2013-01-15 15:20:06	Ed_	no
2013-01-15 15:20:14	Ed_	I think it's pretty clear
2013-01-15 15:20:42	Ed_	the templateData returns a string when I call @site.footnote
2013-01-15 15:21:39	Ed_	so in the docpad.coffee I want to (perhaps this is not best practice, but then I don't know) have the templateData rererence my @links.*** templateData
2013-01-15 15:21:57	Ed_	it was previously possible to do so using the <t> tag
2013-01-15 15:22:22	Ed_	at least using a docpad.cson file
2013-01-15 15:23:22	Ed_	this makes sense because then it is only one place I would need to update a url
2013-01-15 15:44:01	Ed_	it might be clearer here:
2013-01-15 15:44:03	Ed_	http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14339348/reference-templatedata-from-within-docpad-configuration-file
2013-01-15 15:47:14	ashnur	i have misunderstood you in multiple ways

2013-01-15 15:57:04	Ed_	i will add them to the SO question
2013-01-15 15:57:59	supersym	have you checked out the way balupton deals with hyperlinks Ed_?
2013-01-15 15:58:22	supersym	in his docpad.cson file, I think of the Balupton site skeleton
2013-01-15 16:02:03	Ed_	ok more new syntax
2013-01-15 16:02:05	Ed_	aarrgh
2013-01-15 16:02:11	Ed_	but it looks like it will work

2013-01-15 16:02:33	supersym	if you look closely ;)
2013-01-15 16:03:04	supersym	tbh
2013-01-15 16:03:13	supersym	i even write my package.cson now 
2013-01-15 16:03:16	Ed_	really? well im outta my depth
2013-01-15 16:03:36	supersym	and have a Cakefile build my package.json cause its a lot cleaner
2013-01-15 16:03:56	Ed_	k
2013-01-15 16:04:00	Ed_	get to that later
2013-01-15 16:04:07	Ed_	or learn that later I should say :)
2013-01-15 16:04:46	supersym	so let me read back and see what your problem is
2013-01-15 16:05:02	supersym	also im cloning a skeleton but seems to keep hanging on the log
2013-01-15 16:05:16	Ed_	ive updated the SO question btw. which is probly the clearest

2013-01-15 16:11:15	supersym	then you can use some.ofthis
2013-01-15 16:12:54	supersym	and dont worry, if you give it time, the confusion (i too had it initially about docpad/coffeescript) it will fade away :P

2013-01-15 16:13:05	Ed_	he doesn't seem to do this
2013-01-15 16:13:24	Ed_	unless you mean the module.exports

2013-01-15 16:28:07	Ed_	am I missing something. it seems pretty self-contained. 
2013-01-15 16:28:28	Ed_	just the subheading: and the getPreparedLink function
2013-01-15 16:31:11	supersym	ok
2013-01-15 16:31:17	supersym	i think i see what the problem might be
2013-01-15 16:31:25	supersym	but i need to dig around a bit more
2013-01-15 16:31:33	supersym	grep -irn 'site\.' src/documents/*
2013-01-15 16:31:52	supersym	those results seems suspiciously like predefined fields
2013-01-15 16:32:09	supersym	and not to accommodate for customized use like that?
2013-01-15 16:32:19	supersym	nowhere is
2013-01-15 16:32:21	supersym	oh wait
2013-01-15 16:32:23	supersym	damn links
2013-01-15 16:32:26	supersym	not site
2013-01-15 16:33:55	supersym	grep -irn '\blink\.' *  
2013-01-15 16:33:58	supersym	thats a bit better
2013-01-15 16:35:11	supersym	.,.# Link Helper
2013-01-15 16:35:11	supersym	  6 ,.,.getPreparedLink: (name) ->
2013-01-15 16:35:11	supersym	  5 ,.,.,.link = @site.links[name]
2013-01-15 16:35:11	supersym	  4 ,.,.,.renderedLink = """
2013-01-15 16:35:11	supersym	  3 ,.,.,.,.<a href="#{link.url}" title="#{link.title}">#{link.text}</a>
2013-01-15 16:35:11	supersym	  2 ,.,.,.,."""
2013-01-15 16:35:11	supersym	  1 ,.,.,.return renderedLink
2013-01-15 16:35:22	supersym	and thats the logic that deals with your links
2013-01-15 16:36:32	supersym	grep -irn 'getPreparedLink' *
2013-01-15 16:36:45	supersym	and thats where our 'link' variable pops up
2013-01-15 16:36:50	supersym	so here can use link.something
2013-01-15 16:36:59	supersym	like I showed in the fiddle
2013-01-15 16:37:05	Ed_	ah
2013-01-15 16:37:23	supersym	you guys all need to learn and search smarter
2013-01-15 16:37:25	supersym	:P
2013-01-15 16:37:31	supersym	grep is your friend
2013-01-15 16:37:40	supersym	and source code is always speaking the truth
2013-01-15 16:37:54	Ed_	pity I never learned programming
2013-01-15 16:38:08	supersym	yeah i just began to understand regexes
2013-01-15 16:38:14	supersym	one of the hardest things imho
2013-01-15 16:38:31	supersym	but i can live with a year long graduate learning :)
2013-01-15 16:38:34	Ed_	also one of the least 'fun looking'
2013-01-15 16:38:46	Ed_	I wouldn't know ....
2013-01-15 16:39:18	supersym	brb
2013-01-15 16:45:58	supersym	but anyway..this isnt programming :P
2013-01-15 16:46:10	supersym	its just running a program and learning to debug a bit
2013-01-15 16:46:37	supersym	and to use docpad on a more advanced level
2013-01-15 16:46:53	supersym	you'll need to learn about it's (backbone) models and how these return data et
2013-01-15 16:47:00	supersym	*etc
2013-01-15 16:50:17	Ed_	yeah. i've been doing some backbone stuff with another nodejs project
2013-01-15 16:50:34	Ed_	your probably not going to want to hear this but that last idea didn't work either
2013-01-15 16:51:06	Ed_	anyway I am synching right now
2013-01-15 16:51:14	Ed_	so I can show you the actual code
2013-01-15 16:51:19	Ed_	FWIW
2013-01-15 17:00:17	supersym	good
2013-01-15 17:00:43	supersym	well imho ...tbh i would love for ppl to prepare some aid requests a bit better
2013-01-15 17:00:53	supersym	not you specifically
2013-01-15 17:01:17	supersym	but in general 'bug' reports from ppl here, or at work, 'it doesnt do anything'
2013-01-15 17:01:37	supersym	and your follow ups will always be 'what do you mean with: not working?'
2013-01-15 17:01:48	supersym	ppl need to be more specific :P
2013-01-15 17:01:53	supersym	and read the f manuals
2013-01-15 17:01:58	supersym	:)
2013-01-15 17:02:12	supersym	a pastebin to show the code is always nice as well ;)
2013-01-15 17:02:36	supersym	but anyway for your thing to work... i know i had some type checking issues when first using this platform
2013-01-15 17:03:53	Ed_	no worries - here's my site if it helps
2013-01-15 17:03:55	Ed_	https://github.com/edzillion/edzillion.com/blob/master/docpad.coffee#L47
2013-01-15 17:04:06	supersym	good boy :)
2013-01-15 17:05:00	Ed_	hehehe
2013-01-15 17:06:12	supersym	thats not how they are used here
2013-01-15 17:06:14	supersym	https://github.com/docpad/docpad-plugin-text
2013-01-15 17:06:34	supersym	or is it
2013-01-15 17:07:47	supersym	hmmmmm
2013-01-15 17:07:57	supersym	thats a structure you made there
2013-01-15 17:08:05	supersym	damn
2013-01-15 17:08:55	supersym	i am not sure if the docpad template data is exposed to the correct global this way
2013-01-15 17:08:57	Ed_	well it;s copied direct from balupto.com
2013-01-15 17:09:17	supersym	but it seems in line with the dp-plugin-text used syntax
2013-01-15 17:09:29	supersym	although they dont give a .html.coffee example
2013-01-15 17:09:44	supersym	also a few quotes you might be able to mix up
2013-01-15 17:09:53	supersym	i dont like this kind of solutions but ok
2013-01-15 17:10:08	supersym	you sure you have the correct plugins?
2013-01-15 17:10:14	supersym	i guess so
2013-01-15 17:10:28	supersym	if it renders correctly before and only strikes out on that code
2013-01-15 17:10:32	Ed_	i am not
2013-01-15 17:10:43	Ed_	just npm the text plugin now
2013-01-15 17:11:01	supersym	yeah and ensure coffeekup/coffee/eco etc also all there
2013-01-15 17:11:26	supersym	"docpad-plugin-text": "2.x"
2013-01-15 17:11:50	supersym	you didnt use a package.json??
2013-01-15 17:12:09	supersym	what did you use to create the site? no skeleton at all I guess
2013-01-15 17:12:42	supersym	also you, and others, might just also want to stop ignoring node_modules/ in git
2013-01-15 17:12:52	Ed_	why is that
2013-01-15 17:12:57	Ed_	so new to all this :O
2013-01-15 17:13:03	supersym	how do you pull in dependencies everytime?
2013-01-15 17:13:07	supersym	the plugins?
2013-01-15 17:13:16	supersym	normally this is the procedure
2013-01-15 17:13:29	supersym	1) install docpad globally as $ npm i -g docpad
2013-01-15 17:13:33	Ed_	well I am just using git as version control really since it is just me developing
2013-01-15 17:13:46	supersym	so that the command 'docpad' is available throughout the entire file system
2013-01-15 17:13:53	supersym	ok
2013-01-15 17:13:56	Ed_	yes. actually I did do that in the past
2013-01-15 17:14:00	Ed_	I know what you mean
2013-01-15 17:14:09	Ed_	then I can just use 'make' 
2013-01-15 17:14:11	supersym	2) make a folder somewhere like $ cd `mktemp -d`
2013-01-15 17:14:15	Ed_	k
2013-01-15 17:14:24	supersym	or cd into your projects folder, a new one and do
2013-01-15 17:14:30	supersym	3) docpad skeleton
2013-01-15 17:14:46	supersym	there you can select even a empty skeleton (just src/.. )
2013-01-15 17:15:01	supersym	next you'll want to decide on what plugins you need
2013-01-15 17:15:09	supersym	or just choose a existing skeleton
2013-01-15 17:15:17	supersym	these all have package.json files in them
2013-01-15 17:15:23	Ed_	k
2013-01-15 17:15:30	supersym	http://package.json.nodejitsu.com/
2013-01-15 17:15:59	supersym	the minimum you will need are to have 'name, version, engines, dependencies'
2013-01-15 17:16:27	supersym	example pkg.json for a plugin : https://github.com/docpad/docpad-plugin-text/blob/master/package.json
2013-01-15 17:17:09	supersym	but you might just want to use something like: https://github.com/docpad/kitchensink.docpad/blob/master/package.json
2013-01-15 17:17:27	supersym	once you have defined your app/program/package meta-data (package,json)
2013-01-15 17:17:38	supersym	you can just do $ npm i
2013-01-15 17:17:47	supersym	to install everything defined in there
2013-01-15 17:18:18	Ed_	ok thanks for that
2013-01-15 17:19:49	supersym	instead of using the version nrs like that in dependencies
2013-01-15 17:20:10	supersym	you might just be lazy and try "docpad-plugin-something": "latest"
2013-01-15 17:20:43	supersym	or download $ npm i -g npm-latest
2013-01-15 17:20:51	supersym	to easily check version nrs
2013-01-15 17:21:00	supersym	node is pretty good with dependency checkign tho
2013-01-15 17:21:08	supersym	so stuff doesnt break easily
2013-01-15 17:21:29	supersym	also you MUST make sure the links to repos and any binaries etc are correct
2013-01-15 17:21:38	supersym	or it might fail on the $ npm i
2013-01-15 17:21:54	supersym	and it must be JSON.parsable correct notation, no mistaken comma etc
2013-01-15 17:22:21	supersym	this requires some experience before you get it right from scratch
2013-01-15 17:22:30	supersym	so you are always better off with a skeleton
2013-01-15 17:22:36	supersym	and it has enough code examples
2013-01-15 17:22:37	Ed_	yeah
2013-01-15 17:22:39	supersym	to keep you going
2013-01-15 17:25:06	supersym	and, just as a friendly pointer, i'd avoid on too complex structures that nest different types too much
2013-01-15 17:25:48	supersym	coffeescript and docpad etc have some very specific implementations you need to understand to properly parse resulting content
2013-01-15 17:25:55	supersym	like doing .toJSON()
2013-01-15 17:26:05	supersym	neway must run
2013-01-15 17:26:13	supersym	gf wants to do some groceries
2013-01-15 17:33:33	Ed_	well thanks again
2013-01-15 17:33:37	Ed_	very nice of you to help me out

2013-01-15 19:09:53	ashnur	i don't know what dustjs is, but you can use docpad with anything you like
2013-01-15 19:10:22	ashnur	power of javascript

2013-01-15 19:14:47	darkglass	well that's true :) I guess what I mean is has anyone done it. dusts is an async tempting engine now maintained by the folks at linkedin - it's the async bit that got me wondering as most / all of the other supported template solutions for docpad are just normal sync ones
2013-01-15 19:19:01	ashnur	if anyone did something like that, you must find it through google
2013-01-15 19:19:35	ashnur	this channel gets a lot more attention lately then it got some months ago, but google is still better at finding stuff
2013-01-15 19:25:42	darkglass	lol yeah true. I have already looked and found nothing. was kinda hoping someone here may have a better idea or be working on it or...
2013-01-15 19:26:22	darkglass	guess I may have to look see what is involved but juts time lacking right now. Hey ho such is life, too many projects too little time :)

2013-01-16 07:09:35	ashnur	balupton: you mentioned a presentation on queryengine to be produced some time in these days, maybe it's already online? i could really use some help on queryengine right now

2013-01-16 07:16:06	ashnur	these are not working, or at least all of them have typeerrors at start 
2013-01-16 08:08:02	ashnur	balupton: i have this feeling that's it's quite impossible to do this
2013-01-16 08:08:11	ashnur	i mean, it's possible, but it's too slow and hackish

2013-01-16 08:34:57	ashnur	i hate to be stucked
2013-01-16 08:35:04	ashnur	there is no frikin solution to this
2013-01-16 08:36:06	ashnur	i can only provide string based queries, but i can't tell it where to look for it

2013-01-16 08:41:19	ashnur	Comparisons
2013-01-16 08:41:21	ashnur	To find all the models, that have the attribute name set to awesome, we would have the following query: firstname: 'Benjamin'. 
2013-01-16 08:41:23	ashnur	WTF?
2013-01-16 08:49:09	ashnur	i can find all documents which has the categories attribute as an object, and I guess I could write a query to see if the categories object has a certain value, but this is actually an array of objects, and there is no frikin solution to how to check if any of the categories array values has a certain value

2013-01-16 10:34:32	supersym	tricky asynchronous implementations in OOP
2013-01-16 10:35:04	supersym	something: (args) -> or something = () -> or =>
2013-01-16 10:35:34	supersym	and then passing along the callbacks
2013-01-16 10:39:29	supersym	i havent had the js 'this' gotcha yet
2013-01-16 10:39:39	supersym	so that also might just be it
2013-01-16 10:46:25	supersym	.

2013-01-16 15:54:05	supersym	well i just loved the eye candy
2013-01-16 15:55:28	supersym	i am a strong affinity for (natural) languages, classification and such ... thats why I am interested about these things and keep reading up on the wikipedia links on the areas in between all these disciplines
2013-01-16 15:56:11	supersym	but my math always sucked at school, though via programming and English language study... get down to first-order logic path, predicates popping up a again
2013-01-16 15:56:49	supersym	i'll get it over time, i just have to keep looking up what stuff like "real" numbers and "trancedental" or "irrational numbers"
2013-01-16 15:57:17	supersym	so i just made a nice summary from all paras that i needed of all these articles... and I think I'll remember it better now :)
2013-01-16 16:00:48	supersym	the thing is, I would love to once be able and write programs more "natural" to humans without resorting to all the extremely complex cases and frameworks
2013-01-16 16:01:13	supersym	sometimes these linguistic and mathematics can go into overdrive in their attempt to be "full"
2013-01-16 16:02:12	supersym	i should have gone to university here in town afterall it seems, if I'd studied AI there I would know Lisp by now :P{
2013-01-16 16:03:56	supersym	oh well prolly wouldnt have been motivated back then anyway
2013-01-16 16:04:46	ashnur	i can't do this stuff
2013-01-16 16:04:50	ashnur	dammit

2013-01-16 16:11:37	supersym	that isnt too hard is it?
2013-01-16 16:11:44	ashnur	it is impossibru
2013-01-16 16:12:45	supersym	so each category array in meta data refers to objects that have a slug?
2013-01-16 16:12:56	supersym	so categories are documents? no...
2013-01-16 16:13:48	supersym	what properties? from a coffeescript class? @field values like that? because that lang doesnt have real properties
2013-01-16 16:14:32	ashnur	i don't follow you
2013-01-16 16:14:38	supersym	where did you define categories? and where it can get its members from?
2013-01-16 16:14:54	supersym	In my documents meta I have a categories array which has an unknown number of elements. 
2013-01-16 16:14:58	supersym	check... 
2013-01-16 16:15:21	ashnur	i wrote what is. 
2013-01-16 16:15:23	supersym	arrCat = [] or arrCat = [1,2,3]
2013-01-16 16:15:33	supersym	These elements are category objects.
2013-01-16 16:15:33	ashnur	i have documents
2013-01-16 16:15:36	ashnur	which have meta
2013-01-16 16:15:41	ashnur	which have categories

2013-01-16 17:11:38	ashnur	i don't have plans
2013-01-16 17:11:40	ashnur	just dreams
2013-01-16 17:11:45	supersym	i have tons of ideas
2013-01-16 17:12:02	supersym	just need a team to hash through everyone elses
2013-01-16 17:12:16	supersym	and enough ppl of different disciplines
2013-01-16 17:12:23	supersym	but most could do double roles
2013-01-16 17:13:01	supersym	anyway i should really try and reach out to some young wizzkids around the neighbourhood here
2013-01-16 17:13:38	supersym	i could mentor a few while working on stuff, got a pretty gf who speaks native english and she has a pretty gf who also needs a job
2013-01-16 17:13:50	supersym	so i hope to one day, not pimp them out :)
2013-01-16 17:13:59	supersym	but have them do administration ;)
2013-01-16 17:14:06	supersym	and sell ppl stuff :P

2013-01-16 17:14:39	supersym	think she is a hacker? or just the face
2013-01-16 17:14:51	supersym	ok she might actually be the hacker
2013-01-16 17:14:55	supersym	but you get my point
2013-01-16 17:16:33	ashnur	no,i don't i am trying to solve this query you see, and i dont have time to anything else right now
2013-01-16 17:17:39	supersym	oh ahaha
2013-01-16 17:17:53	supersym	right
2013-01-16 17:17:59	supersym	same problem still?
2013-01-16 17:23:31	ashnur	since yesterday
2013-01-16 17:26:23	supersym	aha sec let me just finish installing dutch spellcheck :P
2013-01-16 17:29:48	supersym	so
2013-01-16 17:29:53	supersym	In my documents meta I have a categories array which has an unknown number of elements.
2013-01-16 17:30:03	supersym	unknown? 
2013-01-16 17:30:10	supersym	during build time they are known
2013-01-16 17:30:14	supersym	by array.length
2013-01-16 17:30:19	supersym	which you can iterate
2013-01-16 17:33:23	ashnur	unknown that I can't know how many there are, not that I don't know about .length
2013-01-16 17:34:11	ashnur	i could've said there is usually 1 and most probably max 7, but that should be irrelevant and people would start to ask question I don't want to hear
2013-01-16 17:36:38	supersym	yeah ok
2013-01-16 17:36:41	supersym	i get that
2013-01-16 17:37:15	supersym	so the objects, what are these? arrThis = [ "1", "2", "3" ] are also
2013-01-16 17:37:47	supersym	how do you populate the array if not manually that you can know of? 
2013-01-16 17:37:55	supersym	by pushing stuff?
2013-01-16 17:38:09	ashnur	categories[category1,category2,category3....]
2013-01-16 17:38:21	ashnur	and category1 and the rest has .slug
2013-01-16 17:38:24	supersym	ok so Object category1
2013-01-16 17:38:30	supersym	where is it declared?
2013-01-16 17:38:43	ashnur	i don't populate the array, it is in the frikin meta of the document
2013-01-16 17:38:43	supersym	btw
2013-01-16 17:38:51	supersym	categories: [1,2,3]
2013-01-16 17:38:55	ashnur	it is not declared anyhow
2013-01-16 17:38:55	supersym	double point
2013-01-16 17:38:58	ashnur	it is how i get it
2013-01-16 17:39:24	supersym	dude you can't just pop in anything with no quotes right
2013-01-16 17:39:42	supersym	arrThat: [ 1,2,3 ] are integers as members
2013-01-16 17:39:52	supersym	oh
2013-01-16 17:40:00	supersym	is it cson or yaml?
2013-01-16 17:41:33	ashnur	why does that matter?
2013-01-16 17:41:35	supersym	btw you could just as well populate it on a render event
2013-01-16 17:41:48	ashnur	populate what?
2013-01-16 17:41:51	supersym	well obviously you have some data type stuff mixed up
2013-01-16 17:41:56	supersym	your bloody array :P
2013-01-16 17:42:00	ashnur	no, i don't
2013-01-16 17:42:22	ashnur	i have the array filled up in each document. i don't follow you :(
2013-01-16 17:42:31	supersym	no i get that
2013-01-16 17:42:43	supersym	i don't populate the array, it is in the frikin meta of the document
2013-01-16 17:43:11	supersym	you can iterate a document meta-data field if it is a collection, like an Array
2013-01-16 17:43:17	supersym	but you either have
2013-01-16 17:43:22	supersym	arr: [1,2,3]
2013-01-16 17:43:35	supersym	or arr: [ 1,2,3 ]
2013-01-16 17:43:44	ashnur	i don't have any of that
2013-01-16 17:43:45	ashnur	wait
2013-01-16 17:43:48	supersym	or arr: [@name,@url,@slug]
2013-01-16 17:44:02	supersym	but they need to be real objects under that context
2013-01-16 17:44:11	supersym	you can't just poof them out of thin air
2013-01-16 17:44:22	supersym	put them in an array and expect also var to be declared
2013-01-16 17:44:29	ashnur	http://pastie.org/5697369
2013-01-16 17:44:34	ashnur	sorry about the line numbers
2013-01-16 17:44:47	ashnur	and this is of course not the whole file
2013-01-16 17:44:55	supersym	yeah ok
2013-01-16 17:44:56	supersym	thnx
2013-01-16 17:45:02	ashnur	and in this case categories array has ony one object element
2013-01-16 17:45:11	supersym	aha
2013-01-16 17:45:17	supersym	ok this makes more sense
2013-01-16 17:46:16	supersym	right
2013-01-16 17:46:23	supersym	you were right asking balupton about queryengine
2013-01-16 17:46:31	supersym	would be the obvious choice to filter it out
2013-01-16 17:46:56	supersym	or you get the current document instance, then then append to that
2013-01-16 17:47:07	supersym	oh no wait
2013-01-16 17:47:13	supersym	predefined
2013-01-16 17:47:24	supersym	yeah this is a queryengine thing
2013-01-16 17:47:32	supersym	and i havent had time to fully get that
2013-01-16 17:47:35	ashnur	i don't think it is
2013-01-16 17:47:40	supersym	well
2013-01-16 17:47:46	ashnur	that does ony strings
2013-01-16 17:47:49	supersym	you could also just check on the current instance
2013-01-16 17:48:01	ashnur	i can go so far to check the type of the categories array if it's object
2013-01-16 17:48:08	supersym	and read in the meta-data to do language based filtering
2013-01-16 17:48:13	supersym	or use say underscore

2013-01-16 17:48:34	supersym	you'll need to use underscore then i think, let me check
2013-01-16 17:48:58	ashnur	i have to have collections with each category to list the articles based on that
2013-01-16 17:49:04	supersym	http://underscorejs.org/#contains
2013-01-16 17:49:25	ashnur	i know a gazillion ways how to filter  array elements in javascript

2013-01-16 17:49:35	supersym	i still dont get your point then

2013-01-16 17:50:03	supersym	riiight
2013-01-16 17:50:17	supersym	so its backbone/queryengine
2013-01-16 17:50:26	supersym	because that drives docpads models
2013-01-16 17:50:32	ashnur	backbone is in docpad, right?
2013-01-16 17:50:35	ashnur	yes

2013-01-17 13:12:03	--	Notice(GitHub83): docpad-documentation/master c113f3b Benjamin Arthur Lupton: Updated for latest developments
2013-01-17 13:23:17	balupton	ashnur: for your categories query, you'll probably want to try this - @getCollection('documents').createChildCollection().filter(someFunctionToFilter).toJSON()
2013-01-17 13:23:31	balupton	but considering that will be pretty complicated, you're best off writing a template helper to do it for you
2013-01-17 13:24:31	balupton	it also seems a bit weird having to re-define the category for each document
2013-01-17 13:25:01	balupton	so perhaps moving the category definitions into your docpad.cson file, then inside your meta data just saying: categories: [1,2,3] - or use their slugs
2013-01-17 13:25:18	ashnur	oh
2013-01-17 13:25:39	ashnur	the heavens have forgived me. i will try that asap
2013-01-17 13:25:56	balupton	then your template helpers would look something like: @getCollection('documents').createChildCollection().filter((item) -> return categoryId in item.get('categories')).toJSON()
2013-01-17 13:27:27	balupton	and do another template helper like: getCategories = -> categoryIds = @getDocument().get('categories'); categories = @categories[categoryId] for categoryId in categoryIds; return categories
2013-01-17 13:27:39	ashnur	balupton: i have the cateogories array in the meta of the document from wordpad. i could perhaps rewrite that but I am a bit reluctant of doing such things because it's easier to change a query than a plugin if the format changes in wordpad
2013-01-17 13:28:13	balupton	well, all you would be doing is moving out that logic from your template to your docpad config file
2013-01-17 13:28:26	balupton	so instead of having to change query in every template, just change it once in your config file
2013-01-17 13:28:26	ashnur	i was trying to write a helper function all along
2013-01-17 13:28:43	ashnur	but instead of .filter() i was using .setFilter()
2013-01-17 13:28:49	ashnur	and got empty collections
2013-01-17 13:29:29	ashnur	and the filter has to be dynamic
2013-01-17 13:29:51	ashnur	there is some misunderstanding here :(
2013-01-17 13:32:34	balupton	doing example up now
2013-01-17 13:33:48	balupton	https://gist.github.com/4555641
2013-01-17 13:34:56	ashnur	I do not have the categories 
2013-01-17 13:35:14	ashnur	i mean, I could have
2013-01-17 13:35:31	balupton	how do you mean?
2013-01-17 13:35:57	ashnur	they come from wordpress, and there if you type a new word you add a new category
2013-01-17 13:36:30	ashnur	so every time a post gets a new category saved in it's meta, I should update my docpad.coffee?
2013-01-17 13:37:00	balupton	two options come to mind
2013-01-17 13:37:32	balupton	have a categories.json file that you write all the categories too, then load that up in your docpad config file, so categories: require(__dirname+'/categories.json')
2013-01-17 13:37:57	balupton	or you hook into the parseAfter event and extract the categories out of the documents into your merged categories object
2013-01-17 13:38:39	ashnur	this is much more complicated than I thought :|
2013-01-17 13:40:22	ashnur	i could write the query if all I had was a categories array of strings in the documents
2013-01-17 13:40:35	ashnur	i don't even need to extract the categories or anything
2013-01-17 13:41:49	ashnur	you have in your document" categories: ['a','b']" if I would have that, I wouldn't have this problem for 3 days already
2013-01-17 13:47:55	ashnur	balupton: so basicaly you are saying that with the current methods in queryengine it is impossible to filter by categories if those are not in such format as you wrote in your example. And that if I want to use queryengine for this I must extract the categories from their current format and add them in this much simpler format to the metadata? 
2013-01-17 13:50:37	balupton	ashnur: it is, just use backbones/underscore's filter like I first said
2013-01-17 13:50:52	balupton	@getCollection('documents').createChildCollection().filter(someFunctionToFilter).toJSON()
2013-01-17 13:51:43	balupton	which uses http://backbonejs.org/#Collection-Underscore-Methods
2013-01-17 13:54:01	balupton	but to me it seems a solution like https://gist.github.com/4555641 is a better way to structure the data, but if your categories must be objects in your document meta data, then something like https://gist.github.com/4555732 even could fly
2013-01-17 13:54:14	balupton	but if you're after a simple one liner, then the backbone collection filter function will work fine
2013-01-17 13:54:40	balupton	query engine is for advanced queryies, backbone.js already provides things for basic filtering
2013-01-17 13:55:04	ashnur	https://gist.github.com/4555765
2013-01-17 13:55:09	ashnur	i am trying this with no success
2013-01-17 13:56:08	balupton	createLiveChildCollection -> createChildCollection
2013-01-17 13:56:14	balupton	we are not working with live collections here
2013-01-17 13:56:23	balupton	as these are one off queries
2013-01-17 13:57:43	ashnur	you are right of course, I missed that, it still returns empty array, according to the console log. the object returned doesn't have a toJSON() method for sure
2013-01-17 14:02:02	ashnur	i've tried @getCollection('documents').createChildCollection() instead of @getDatabase().findAll({layout: 'articles.html.eco'}).createChildCollection()
2013-01-17 14:02:06	ashnur	same results
2013-01-17 14:02:20	ashnur	i guess i have to read through the source again
2013-01-17 14:02:30	balupton	trying locally now
2013-01-17 14:02:39	balupton	bare with me :)
2013-01-17 14:02:45	balupton	we'll figure this out
2013-01-17 14:03:13	ashnur	it's frustrating, i don't want to keep you up with something like this though

2013-01-17 14:15:38	balupton	so the annoying thing is that .filter returns an array of documents, rather than a collection
2013-01-17 14:15:54	balupton	so we had to shuffle our createChildCollection logic around
2013-01-17 14:16:11	balupton	I will do up a guide on how people can debug things like this
2013-01-17 14:16:26	balupton	as v6 makes debugging these things way easier but the docs on debugging haven't been updated yet
2013-01-17 14:17:48	balupton	but it's good for me to become familiar with the main pain points people are experiencing so that way I can make those things easier
2013-01-17 14:18:00	balupton	this is definitely an example where it shouldn't have been that hard, so I will think about what I can do
2013-01-17 14:38:33	ashnur	it is clear that some more experience with backbone collections would've been good for me. 
2013-01-17 14:39:13	ashnur	balupton: thanks for the solutions, it was driving me mad :( 
2013-01-17 14:39:25	ashnur	i am going to update the SO question as well
2013-01-17 14:39:47	ashnur	what I don't get is the .pluck('title') in the comment, why would I need that?
2013-01-17 14:43:00	balupton	that's just an example for listing
2013-01-17 14:43:25	balupton	in reality you would probably want to cycle the listing and then show links to the articles or something
2013-01-17 14:44:27	ashnur	there are quite a few situations in which these are going to be used. maybe even for menus and stuff
2013-01-17 14:45:31	ashnur	i needed a working solution to graps how it works so that I can tinker it around into different forms. but I was on a completely wrong path with setFilter()
2013-01-17 14:49:55	ashnur	at least adding a count argument to the function is trivial :D
2013-01-17 15:10:02	balupton	actually, set filter should have worked
2013-01-17 15:10:13	balupton	let me fiddle with that and find out why it didn't
2013-01-17 15:12:53	ashnur	there is an SO question with an answer where the same issue is present
2013-01-17 15:13:10	ashnur	http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14353716/how-to-query-documents-in-docpad-based-on-arrays-of-objects
2013-01-17 15:13:29	balupton	https://gist.github.com/4555765
2013-01-17 15:13:33	balupton	updated it with setFilter
2013-01-17 15:14:11	balupton	Who's Dharma?
2013-01-17 15:14:25	ashnur	I don't have a clue

2013-01-17 15:15:10	ashnur	:)
2013-01-17 15:15:24	balupton	it's good we have the community answering SO questions now
2013-01-17 15:15:33	balupton	do you think the .setFilter code is cleaner than the .filter code?
2013-01-17 15:16:41	ashnur	a bit clearer, yes 
2013-01-17 15:17:05	ashnur	but the sorting and slicing ( having a count argument to return only the latest 5 articles) is harder then
2013-01-17 15:17:30	balupton	use query engine's setPaging
2013-01-17 15:17:32	ashnur	because I only know how to sort and slice arrays
2013-01-17 15:17:41	ashnur	hmm
2013-01-17 15:17:53	ashnur	i am trying it right now 
2013-01-17 15:26:27	ashnur	i wish there was documentation for it :-"
2013-01-17 15:27:52	balupton	paging is newish
2013-01-17 15:28:03	balupton	hehe, but yeah I wish soo too
2013-01-17 15:29:27	ashnur	i am trying .query().setPagin({limit:countArgVar})
2013-01-17 15:30:24	ashnur	it worked when i added the {limit:count} as the third argument to findAllLive()
2013-01-17 15:32:46	balupton	setPaging({limit:blah}) should be done before .query()
2013-01-17 15:33:06	balupton	as setFilter, setPaging, etc all just sets what needs to be done, .query actually does what needs to be done
2013-01-17 15:33:21	balupton	answered here - http://stackoverflow.com/a/14381327/130638
2013-01-17 15:34:09	ashnur	oh. i should use my brain sometimes
2013-01-17 15:35:41	ashnur	thanks for the SO answer, it's the best
2013-01-17 15:35:44	balupton	I should be more clear sometimes
2013-01-17 15:42:10	ashnur	I've learned a lot today
2013-01-17 15:42:18	ashnur	that's for sure
2013-01-17 15:42:41	ashnur	must think about and rewrite some awkward things i've done

2013-01-18 09:23:27	ashnur	but thanks :)
2013-01-18 09:23:34	ashnur	anyway
2013-01-18 09:24:05	ashnur	it is sure that with such a document structure the queries would've been straightforward
2013-01-18 09:24:57	ashnur	and I am not sure if this tool saves the images with the documents, or just the html>markdown
2013-01-18 09:25:07	balupton	just html I'm pretty sure
2013-01-18 09:25:12	balupton	html and comments
2013-01-18 09:26:36	ashnur	then it's not what I need, I need the wordpress to be an admin ui, that was the idea you gave :) 
2013-01-18 09:26:49	ashnur	and it was a very good idea
2013-01-18 09:27:21	ashnur	although it's kinda strange when other developers come along and ask why do i need nodejs, why not do everything in wordpress

2013-01-18 09:31:58	supersym	well balupton: you are correct that people should try not to write bad code :P but damn can JavaScript become complicated in ways you can work with first-class functions and nesting
2013-01-18 09:32:20	supersym	most ppl don't have the background in a mathematical sense of the way it works
2013-01-18 09:33:02	ashnur	I don't think that's true
2013-01-18 09:33:28	supersym	really you dont?
2013-01-18 09:33:31	ashnur	ok, not everyone can write good code as not everyone can sing or paint or anything 
2013-01-18 09:33:36	supersym	ok...sometimes we make up our own problems
2013-01-18 09:33:44	supersym	if we are only pragmatic and flexible enough
2013-01-18 09:33:51	supersym	a program can be simple as 1 line of code
2013-01-18 09:33:56	ashnur	but if you can write good code in any language, you can write good codein javascript. not coffeescript, javascript. 
2013-01-18 09:34:14	ashnur	don't complicate it again :D
2013-01-18 09:34:19	supersym	yeah if you are a linguistically motivated programmer
2013-01-18 09:34:28	supersym	how many web developers can actually code
2013-01-18 09:34:31	ashnur	no, it's the matter of practice, that's all 
2013-01-18 09:34:33	supersym	and I mean really code
2013-01-18 09:34:44	supersym	it's a matter of learning to see patterns
2013-01-18 09:34:49	supersym	and doing some research
2013-01-18 09:34:58	supersym	but most frameworks don't motivate you to do either
2013-01-18 09:35:07	ashnur	no. it's practice. you are sinking into the details again too much :)
2013-01-18 09:35:29	supersym	:P
2013-01-18 09:35:31	supersym	lol
2013-01-18 09:35:42	supersym	practice equals repetition
2013-01-18 09:35:47	supersym	monkey learning a trick
2013-01-18 09:35:49	ashnur	not quite
2013-01-18 09:35:56	supersym	just dont ask him to explain why it works and how
2013-01-18 09:35:56	ashnur	well, we are kind of a monkey.
2013-01-18 09:36:10	ashnur	that is also a good thing to do, code review
2013-01-18 09:36:15	supersym	i had soldiers who could open the gate quite well
2013-01-18 09:36:25	supersym	but when I asked why we closed it at certain moments
2013-01-18 09:36:28	supersym	they didnt have a clue
2013-01-18 09:36:34	supersym	:)
2013-01-18 09:36:36	supersym	yeah
2013-01-18 09:36:47	supersym	I use Google closure compiler + autofix atm a bit
2013-01-18 09:36:51	supersym	me like
2013-01-18 09:36:57	ashnur	i don't use anything.
2013-01-18 09:37:01	ashnur	vim
2013-01-18 09:37:02	supersym	meh
2013-01-18 09:37:06	supersym	you do this way longer
2013-01-18 09:37:13	ashnur	and I am not even good with vim 
2013-01-18 09:37:34	supersym	I just learned JS like not so long, never did this stuff only OOP in C#.NET
2013-01-18 09:37:42	supersym	its very different
2013-01-18 09:37:55	supersym	one object here, doesn't work like objects there
2013-01-18 09:38:37	ashnur	yeah, it's much simpler and easier in js
2013-01-18 09:38:55	ashnur	js is the best thing because it accomplishes the most with the least 
2013-01-18 09:39:12	supersym	yeah true as in that its multi-paradigm
2013-01-18 09:39:20	supersym	but aweful looking
2013-01-18 09:39:26	ashnur	that is subjective
2013-01-18 09:39:42	ashnur	there are a few things you can't do very nicely
2013-01-18 09:39:55	ashnur	but very few. 
2013-01-18 09:40:06	supersym	define nicely
2013-01-18 09:40:16	ashnur	define aweful looking
2013-01-18 09:40:22	supersym	and what constitutes a 'hack' you might also ask
2013-01-18 09:40:25	ashnur	it's the opposite of that
2013-01-18 09:40:28	ashnur	;D
2013-01-18 09:40:36	supersym	one mans quick n dirty is another guys hard work for a week
2013-01-18 09:40:58	supersym	but anyway I can get past that with best practices
2013-01-18 09:41:09	supersym	but its also got a subjective qualification in it :P
2013-01-18 09:41:21	ashnur	hack is when you use a tool for something it was not intended for. like heating your tea with an iron
2013-01-18 09:41:38	supersym	the 'authority' as in foremost bloggers, writer of a language, intent behind it, original scope of problem solving
2013-01-18 09:42:03	supersym	the intent is to print a form
2013-01-18 09:42:09	supersym	it still does that i just modified it
2013-01-18 09:42:32	supersym	so that its font is bigger...
2013-01-18 09:42:53	supersym	is that costomization only when the author intended the program to be configured like explicitely?
2013-01-18 09:43:20	ashnur	i don't get it. that is css stuff, should not have anything to do with js
2013-01-18 09:43:30	supersym	hahaha
2013-01-18 09:43:37	ashnur	if you have to use js to do that, it's a very bad tool.
2013-01-18 09:43:39	supersym	lol i get it
2013-01-18 09:43:51	supersym	customize the way a js program works :P
2013-01-18 09:44:29	supersym	a flexible language should not have concepts like 'hack' in that sense because flexible intent is to solve problem in a flexible manner
2013-01-18 09:44:55	supersym	i am looking at it from a nomenclature/logical perspective as a counter argument
2013-01-18 09:45:14	ashnur	you make me want to weep, and sleep a thousand years :P
2013-01-18 09:45:25	supersym	but sorry :P i don't mind being wrong nor do i want to argue personal flavors :)
2013-01-18 09:45:29	supersym	hahaha
2013-01-18 09:45:30	ashnur	the speed you change subjects
2013-01-18 09:45:44	ashnur	i am not used to it
2013-01-18 09:46:45	supersym	hehe ... i hear that more often :P
2013-01-18 09:46:57	ashnur	i have some trouble
2013-01-18 09:47:24	supersym	btw orientdb works great
2013-01-18 09:47:29	supersym	thanks again :)
2013-01-18 09:47:49	ashnur	when i am in some category on my page. example.com/categoryname/ which of course is a document as src/documents/categorydir/index.html, how can I get the category name
2013-01-18 09:47:55	ashnur	:)
2013-01-18 09:52:35	supersym	slugs again?
2013-01-18 09:53:11	ashnur	well, it is the same as the slug of the categories, but this is after it got extracted, saved, generated, whatever
2013-01-18 09:53:42	supersym	perhaps be in the urls array?
2013-01-18 09:54:19	ashnur	balupton: the one and only thing I don't like in docpad is that object are too large, not very easy to understand them unless you wrote them of course :)
2013-01-18 09:54:35	ashnur	smaller, more separated object would  help a lot
2013-01-18 09:55:12	supersym	i really have a hard time following you sometimes :)
2013-01-18 09:55:30	supersym	so i guess we share that in common :)
2013-01-18 09:56:10	ashnur	my english isn't very good, so I write a lot of things which are hard to follow
2013-01-18 09:56:29	supersym	yeah and these are ambigious terms
2013-01-18 09:57:14	supersym	as in easily mixed up because most are very programming generic terms
2013-01-18 09:57:51	supersym	oh well.. I wonder, what object is becoming large? you mean the chain? Like.this.could.be.them?
2013-01-18 09:58:01	supersym	or large as in volume, size, bloat
2013-01-18 09:58:10	ashnur	no. all of them. this, usually
2013-01-18 09:58:14	ashnur	`this`
2013-01-18 09:58:19	ashnur	but even the models
2013-01-18 09:58:48	supersym	yeah well i had that a bit too after i dug in the source more intensively
2013-01-18 09:59:31	supersym	i found the amount of similiar appearing properties to be large in quanity and wonder if all those paths etc can be abstracted or stored some other way
2013-01-18 10:00:46	supersym	if thats what you mean anyway... 
2013-01-18 10:01:56	supersym	but thats because obviously we need to model the program to our intent, this is best done representational in a model, that models reality according to flow I guess but more importantly: what do you want to feature and how do you keep sanity
2013-01-18 10:02:01	ashnur	i don't know if the url's arrays order is always like this
2013-01-18 10:02:14	ashnur	also it has a slash
2013-01-18 10:02:31	supersym	we could also all just kick out our computers and use counting beads again... very simple, elegant and everyone can use it :P
2013-01-18 10:02:34	ashnur	the relativeOutDirPath seems to contain what I need, but wtf
2013-01-18 10:03:11	supersym	urls order of appearancew doesnt that depend on if its async or not
2013-01-18 10:03:14	ashnur	or .meta.href
2013-01-18 10:03:17	ashnur	that is also ok
2013-01-18 10:03:47	ashnur	oh, there is a href
2013-01-18 10:03:56	supersym	:)
2013-01-18 10:05:24	ashnur	still not the best. 
2013-01-18 10:05:41	ashnur	as I have to be able to make a distintion between these and the main page
2013-01-18 10:06:12	ashnur	of course I could use different layouts for them, but i wish to avoid that
2013-01-18 10:06:48	supersym	you want the basename?
2013-01-18 10:07:03	ashnur	what is a basename?
2013-01-18 10:07:17	supersym	also, can't you do a regex on a greater string and extract the substring?
2013-01-18 10:07:47	ashnur	that wouldn't solve my current issue
2013-01-18 10:07:55	ashnur	or at least not in a convenient way
2013-01-18 10:08:23	supersym	The way it works is by looking into src/files/associated-files/#{document.associatedFilesDirectory or document.basename} for files. Where associatedFilesDirectory is set in your document's meta data, and if it doesn't exist it will use the document's basename (e.g. the basename of my-holiday-2012.html.eco is my-holiday-2012).
2013-01-18 10:08:48	ashnur	no, i don't want that
2013-01-18 10:09:00	ashnur	thanks for the explanation
2013-01-18 10:09:10	supersym	oh i just copy pasted that :P
2013-01-18 10:09:49	ashnur	i know
2013-01-18 10:13:30	ashnur	and i frikin miss my ternaries :(((((((((
2013-01-18 10:14:15	ashnur	I will never ever be able to like a language without ternaries. what is this, frikin pascal?
2013-01-18 10:14:18	ashnur	delphi?

2013-01-18 10:28:03	supersym	now I do
2013-01-18 10:29:18	supersym	doesn't js have that? i thought it did
2013-01-18 10:31:38	balupton	js: true ? 'yes' : 'no

2013-01-18 10:32:09	balupton	;)
2013-01-18 10:33:57	supersym	yeah im ready up on ti
2013-01-18 10:34:13	supersym	another term in the outskirts of programming i didnt know of
2013-01-18 10:34:28	supersym	most normal people would run away hard from that
2013-01-18 10:34:54	supersym	if find them crude in a sense that you might just as well resort to bitwise programming then
2013-01-18 10:35:17	supersym	if we start replacing normal logical structures and resort back to symbols for their representation
2013-01-18 10:35:19	supersym	*shrugs*
2013-01-18 10:35:45	supersym	i see that in a lisp language or something
2013-01-18 10:37:41	supersym	(setf result (if (> a b) x y))
2013-01-18 10:38:29	balupton	I wonder about that too, I figure some people's minds are just wired wayyyy differently from mine
2013-01-18 10:38:41	supersym	logical structures as in approaching a more natural language fashion
2013-01-18 10:39:12	supersym	yeah well i dont know
2013-01-18 10:39:42	supersym	mate these places here on irc etc are good for me, because sure as hell no one i know ever really knows what im talking about :(
2013-01-18 10:40:04	supersym	but im rather sure im correct so i was for anyone to call my bullshit and prove otherwise
2013-01-18 10:40:41	supersym	CoffeeScript <-> JS <-> Clojure
2013-01-18 10:40:48	supersym	so can I do Clojure to CS now?
2013-01-18 10:41:03	supersym	and vice versa?
2013-01-18 10:47:27	ashnur	the fact is that javascript is more like lisp than it is Java or C
2013-01-18 10:47:32	ashnur	and that is a good thing :)
2013-01-18 10:47:51	ashnur	i never learned lisp or scheme or haskell or anything like these
2013-01-18 10:48:29	ashnur	but this thing that I can move around functions like I could move around a string, and be sure that I will get the same thing again and again
2013-01-18 10:48:42	ashnur	it makes me feel confident about what I do
2013-01-18 10:49:09	ashnur	and I don't have this in coffeescript :( I can't even write code in coffee without having the language reference open all the time and checking it
2013-01-18 10:49:41	supersym	true i still also have this atm but less and less
2013-01-18 10:49:44	supersym	but dude
2013-01-18 10:49:48	supersym	you got used to years of JS
2013-01-18 10:49:56	supersym	I wouldnt have switched either
2013-01-18 10:50:08	supersym	its a very powerful and versatile language, I never knew that
2013-01-18 10:50:37	supersym	i never did function in JS past function someFunc() { }
2013-01-18 10:50:49	supersym	the rest, you lost me there
2013-01-18 10:51:10	ashnur	like this: http://vimeo.com/45140590 
2013-01-18 10:51:13	supersym	but in my case, seeing how cs compiles from JS and back made me understand that
2013-01-18 10:52:55	ashnur	just watch the video, if you have not seen it yet
2013-01-18 10:52:58	ashnur	it's good
2013-01-18 10:53:14	ashnur	it's even better if you try to copy that while watching
2013-01-18 10:53:29	ashnur	and pause and see if you get it
2013-01-18 10:53:53	supersym	thank you
2013-01-18 10:54:02	ashnur	maybe people like balupton do not need to do that, but I definitely had to reproduce and wonder about the code to understand what's happening
2013-01-18 10:54:19	supersym	oh I always have to do that, let it sink in
2013-01-18 10:54:23	ashnur	but it really changed the way I think about functions
2013-01-18 10:54:33	supersym	balupton also has from what I understand with the async callbacks
2013-01-18 10:54:52	supersym	which from some analogies of the king and servents i luckily better understood
2013-01-18 10:55:17	supersym	i had a friend network operator, they explained ssh and tunneling through using a physical pipe to demonstrate the idea
2013-01-18 10:55:28	supersym	while you'd think the name does give a hint :P
2013-01-18 10:56:09	supersym	some people seem better at describing the world in terms of mathematics I guess due to their brain frontal/temporal? lobes and what not
2013-01-18 10:56:21	supersym	mine is more geared towards language
2013-01-18 10:56:29	supersym	although you'd say math is language too
2013-01-18 10:58:02	ashnur	don't get me started on math
2013-01-18 10:59:36	 *	ashnur hates lawyers, mathematicians, economists and marketing people.
2013-01-18 11:00:04	ashnur	lairs

2013-01-18 11:05:10	supersym	haha
2013-01-18 11:05:35	supersym	trust, 'truth' and reality are all very subjective
2013-01-18 11:06:16	supersym	lawyers make their money placing the seed of doubt and claim we must have irrefutable evidence their client did it
2013-01-18 11:06:38	supersym	i say: if it walks like a duck...i talks like a duck, it probably is donald
2013-01-18 11:07:16	supersym	circumstancial evidence, if enough present, for me can be enough to serve as some form 'proof'
2013-01-18 11:07:27	supersym	and luckily also in court
2013-01-18 11:07:57	supersym	same goes for mathematics i guess, you can claim a lot etc but until proven, it's not a law/axiom
2013-01-18 11:08:00	supersym	but even then
2013-01-18 11:08:02	supersym	fuck it
2013-01-18 11:08:14	supersym	all goes out the window in the multi-verse or matrix :D
2013-01-18 11:11:00	ashnur	yeah, all truth is objective but strangely we all know that leaving buildings through the 8th floor window is not a good idea
2013-01-18 11:11:15	ashnur	subjective*. i can't even be ironic anymore
2013-01-18 11:12:45	ashnur	it's 2013, it would be great if people would start to understand that just because we can't know anything for sure, that doesn't mean that there isn't an objective reality which we can test, enquire and rely on 
2013-01-18 11:16:41	supersym	yeah...else you might as well start shooting everyone because there would be no universal moral or good and bad
2013-01-18 11:17:31	supersym	i dont know how accurate certain predictions with machines and unproven theories are so far

2013-01-21 17:19:58	sergeylukin	balupton: thanks. however I prefer to serve static pregenerated website and I need to force browser reloading asset whenever I update it, in other words prefixing it with build id or timestamp or maybe adding query parameter to the URI. I like the way yeoman does it.

2013-01-21 20:30:35	sergeylukin	also I wonder if anyone tried to integrate RequireJS into docpad workflow and if so how did it turn out
2013-01-21 21:04:43	ashnur	i hate requirejs
2013-01-21 21:04:52	ashnur	i will probably never ever use it

2013-01-21 21:52:58	sergeylukin	why so?
2013-01-21 21:59:39	ashnur	because it sucks
2013-01-21 21:59:53	ashnur	but i don't want to be entirely childish on this
2013-01-21 21:59:58	ashnur	why do you use it?
2013-01-21 22:03:16	sergeylukin	I believe that AMD is very scalable and I find requirejs optimizer very powerful tool
2013-01-21 22:05:25	sergeylukin	anyways there is a conflict between requirejs and docpad-plugin-livereload and I wonder if anyone got it working
2013-01-21 22:27:27	supersym	yeah I tried AMD once
2013-01-21 22:27:30	supersym	blazing fast
2013-01-21 22:28:10	supersym	insane actually how much speed I gained... but too much hassle in the end, a nuclear bomb to kill the fly that was bothering me
2013-01-21 22:28:20	supersym	I used it with Jam I think :)

2013-01-21 22:39:46	ashnur	yeah. amd. the buzzword of buzzwords in javascript land
2013-01-21 22:40:13	ashnur	well, i never once needed this. so I am not using it.
2013-01-21 22:40:56	ashnur	dunno really what applications need amd
2013-01-21 22:47:18	supersym	well I could imagine that if you'd have lots of data to render on the client side, lots of different libraries/components interjoined :P
2013-01-21 22:47:20	supersym	damn
2013-01-21 22:47:56	supersym	can you check https://api.github.com/repos/octocat/Hello-World
2013-01-21 22:48:04	supersym	message: "API Rate Limit Exceeded for
2013-01-21 22:48:17	supersym	I didn't use the API for like 2 days or so
2013-01-21 22:48:25	supersym	I wonder if thats their side or mine
2013-01-21 22:54:36	ashnur	i don't really get it. modules are for not to have a lot of things interjoined. not at once. one thing at a time. maybe for something really big like a large app as facebook or gmail or some really really have UI which has to have a lot's of stuff present, it might be good to not load them only when the user makes requests to it
2013-01-21 22:54:50	ashnur	but then, that I can achieve without requirejs anyway 
2013-01-21 22:55:29	ashnur	i really think that requirejs is solving a non-existent  problem by introducing a lot of real problems
2013-01-21 22:55:48	ashnur	so I don't like it and will probably never use it
2013-01-21 22:56:54	ashnur	supersym: that github link gives me back a medium/large sized json
2013-01-21 22:57:15	ashnur	i think it's "working" by the look of it
2013-01-21 23:08:46	sergeylukin	i see json as well
2013-01-21 23:45:15	supersym	damn
2013-01-21 23:45:29	supersym	that sucks...something must be wrong on my side then
2013-01-21 23:53:02	supersym	ok im back so it seems

2013-01-24 02:11:45	woah	Topcat: ^
2013-01-24 02:13:24	Topcat	hm ok. What's getblock doing if I have to add styles anyway?
2013-01-24 02:15:12	balupton	Topcat: This is inside the beginner guide:
2013-01-24 02:15:12	balupton	ADDING THE BLOCKS
2013-01-24 02:15:12	balupton	Blocks are a way for plugins and even ourselves to be able to easily add scripts, styles and meta elements to our pages. In the instance of the Live Reload Plugin, it needs the Script Block to be able to inject the needed scripts into the page so it can refresh browser whenever changes are made.
2013-01-24 02:15:45	balupton	could it be more clear?
2013-01-24 02:16:04	balupton	if so, do tell :)
2013-01-24 02:26:57	Topcat	I was looking at the template data references that's why I missed that. 
2013-01-24 02:57:33	Topcat	So queryEngine makes a backbone model of all the files, does getBlock just wrap a backbone collection i have to add models to?
2013-01-24 03:00:12	Topcat	also you made bal-util right? I noticed the boilerplate-grunt skeleton doesn't work in windows. To spawn grunt in a child process on windows you need to call grunt with its extension. 
2013-01-24 03:11:44	Topcat	I'm picking up docpad, backbone, grunt and coffeescript at once it's a lot to take in. Sorry for the obv question.

2013-01-24 12:32:45	supersym	I was actually wondering about that 'case' with hogan, if you'd need a skeleton for them, just as with certain plugins perhaps... if they are/can be so small
2013-01-24 12:34:06	supersym	and demonstrated how they work, how we fix, maintain them - if a patch like / script example with say curl pulling in a txt/code file
2013-01-24 12:35:15	supersym	wouldn't show it enough for ppl...since they are accustomed to a command line anyway.... sometimes it just seems a little to justify its own logical container (e.g. repo, plugin)
2013-01-24 12:35:52	supersym	on the other hand, this is something people want to choose between: stylus or sass, hogan or text templates
2013-01-24 12:36:13	supersym	imho it would make more sense to show a list from the docpad executable
2013-01-24 12:36:38	supersym	and pick from there, store all in the same repo and pull in one or multiple template languages etc
2013-01-24 12:36:53	supersym	i guess it also depends on who is maintaining what

2013-01-24 13:47:13	supersym	perhaps for stuff that should really be under the hood,... like plugins that bevry has under their own wing, but also 'accepted' external / community plugins after "ok" them could have the list of those plugins, ratings etc exposed as json REST data over the web
2013-01-24 13:48:17	supersym	guess that would be the only solid way to publish frequently changing 'official' data like that
2013-01-24 13:48:27	supersym	you dont wanna push the entire framework for it every time :)
2013-01-24 13:51:06	supersym	for stuff that ppl want included, external/community created plugins you'd even be able to just have github pull requests but I dont know how easy it is for them to then maintain a plugin
2013-01-24 13:51:30	supersym	you'd want people to be able and hook in their own, even buggy, plugins ... if only for testing purposes
2013-01-24 13:52:52	supersym	just as long as they don't get 'published' as such to the general public
2013-01-24 13:53:42	supersym	then again I have lot's of named 'docpad-plugin-x' under my github now, anyone searching there instead of 'npm s' would inspect them perhaps, find nothing under 'master' branch but develop have a lot of experimental code
2013-01-24 13:56:11	supersym	i did so in essence to logically bring some stuff i had in mind to further explore under the roof of docpad, as a 'channel' for quickly scaffolding web-stuff but it also made me realise the downside of explicitly naming github repo's this way: the direct association people have with docpad as in the 'official' channel, and perhaps expect working plugins there... in the end, if I didnt intend to publish
2013-01-24 13:56:11	supersym	straight away it should have been named differently and perhaps I should had put it all under 1 big experimental repo
2013-01-24 13:56:50	supersym	but it still brings forth the fact that everyone has means to 'expose' their repo named like 'docpad'
2013-01-24 13:57:17	supersym	using only 'npm' is of course the way everyone should currently look for docpad plugins

2013-01-24 13:58:07	supersym	look at 'ender' or 'jam' and they use some methods based on 'npm search' results where I believe ender will put their plugin compatible packages on top
2013-01-24 13:58:58	supersym	but if we also want something with rating, REST using HTTP verbs builtin functions that come with a cli tool would facilitate much more flexibility
2013-01-24 13:59:48	philhawksworth1	Ho folks. Does anyone know if it is possible to use @getFilesAtPath() to return files at a location not in the documents directory?
2013-01-24 14:00:04	supersym	'docpad-plugin rate stylus great' -> app.Post url to docpad running cloud machine
2013-01-24 14:00:12	philhawksworth1	in other words, I'm trying to create a pages which lists the files in the partials directory
2013-01-24 14:00:15	philhawksworth1	for reference
2013-01-24 14:00:53	supersym	@philhawksworth1 I don't know, I had problems with that last time but in the meanwhile know a lot more
2013-01-24 14:00:57	supersym	so I could check for you :)
2013-01-24 14:03:35	supersym	@balupton in summary, you'd might present plugins in time in the same manner we handle skeletons now
2013-01-24 14:03:46	philhawksworth1	thanks supersym! I'm trying to get to grips with the API and usage patterns

2013-01-24 14:15:22	supersym	just use getCollection('partials')
2013-01-24 14:15:33	supersym	i can't get it using getFilesAtPath either
2013-01-24 14:15:50	supersym	should work with relative path etc but I don't know
2013-01-24 14:16:06	supersym	since you have a collection of partials already, that is the cleanest solution
2013-01-24 14:19:38	supersym	the Standard Template helpers page would really benefit from some examples
2013-01-24 14:19:47	supersym	getFilesAtPath(relativePath) get a file at the given path, path is processed through getPat
2013-01-24 14:19:51	supersym	get a 
2013-01-24 14:20:02	supersym	'file'? should be 'files' I guess
2013-01-24 14:20:16	supersym	but '../partials' won't work though
2013-01-24 14:20:27	supersym	and I was at src/documents
2013-01-24 14:21:30	supersym	anyway the deal with collections is that anyone can add them...in this case the partials collection isn;t listed in the documentation http://docpad.org/docs/template-data
2013-01-24 14:21:37	supersym	because it got added by the plugin
2013-01-24 14:21:50	supersym	and thus not 'standard'
2013-01-24 14:22:23	philhawksworth1	thanks supersym!! I'll try that now

2013-01-24 14:39:39	philhawksworth1	thanks supersym. Using getCollection got me what I needed. 
2013-01-24 14:40:27	philhawksworth1	I agree that it would be good to get more usage examples into the documentation. It's great that so much is listed there, but a little more detail would go a long way.
2013-01-24 14:40:30	ashnur	supersym: you should really write a blog

2013-01-24 14:41:08	philhawksworth1	is there a good pace to find docs on getCollection?

2013-01-24 14:47:31	philhawksworth1	I'm going to have to make the leap from js to coffeescript!
2013-01-24 14:47:47	supersym	I'm glad I did,...ashnur is back with JS
2013-01-24 14:47:59	supersym	you should if you like it but it can get ppl in the way
2013-01-24 14:48:26	supersym	although I had to do a lot of coffeescript reference doc searches I get the hang of it now
2013-01-24 14:48:40	supersym	and it's soooo nice to write package.json as package.cson :)
2013-01-24 14:49:43	philhawksworth1	am I big js and json fan 
2013-01-24 14:49:55	philhawksworth1	and have been resistant to coffeescript for a while
2013-01-24 14:50:10	philhawksworth1	but it will be useful to be more comfortable with it
2013-01-24 14:50:11	supersym	yeah many also dont like every statement returns values
2013-01-24 14:50:18	supersym	so much less typing
2013-01-24 14:50:47	philhawksworth1	I'm not too bothered about that really...
2013-01-24 14:50:55	philhawksworth1	but do like some of the sugar it gives you

2013-01-25 13:33:20	ashnur	dunno why would you compress it
2013-01-25 13:35:13	zenorocha	never mind
2013-01-25 13:35:17	zenorocha	I fixed here
2013-01-25 13:35:18	zenorocha	=]
2013-01-25 13:49:04	darky	compress less stupid idea, because it's then rendered in css.
2013-01-25 13:49:20	darky	You may use csso for compress css
2013-01-25 13:50:54	darky	If you use grunt task manager, you may use grunt-csso plugin

2013-01-25 14:25:29	zenorocha	it's not a fully compression right?
2013-01-25 14:25:39	balupton	pretty sure it is...
2013-01-25 14:25:43	zenorocha	it should be on a single line

2013-01-25 14:28:15	balupton	I wonder if we can make a grunt plugin that auto mins the css, js and images

2013-01-25 14:30:04	balupton	I'd be happy to coach
2013-01-25 14:30:37	balupton	btw, zenorocha: what do you think of having a video section on the docpad-website, where people can upload their own videos too - so like guides, tutorials, etc
2013-01-25 14:31:15	zenorocha	that's pretty nice
2013-01-25 14:31:20	balupton	my goals before feb 15 are - new debug documentation, new dynamic abilities guide
2013-01-25 14:31:30	balupton	after that - importers, importers, importers

2013-01-25 14:32:24	balupton	evidence that I'm not as crazy as I thought I was
2013-01-25 14:32:29	balupton	:P
2013-01-25 14:33:09	balupton	yeah, right now the big feedback we get from people are: 1. oh, I didn't realise it could do dynamic stuff! and 2. it needs a client-facing GUI
2013-01-25 14:33:24	balupton	so the new docs will address point 1, and the importers will address point 2
2013-01-25 14:34:25	balupton	it's also great how the contributors are growing, there is you, working on awesome skeletons - ashnur working on wordpress and IRC - supersym thinking about docs - chase working on the website - and plenty of others submitting plugins and documentation updates
2013-01-25 14:34:28	balupton	it's real cool

2013-01-25 15:23:21	mikeumus	Hey Gang, I'm trying to add some Bootstrap <i>cons in my generated header pages like this: 
2013-01-25 15:23:27	mikeumus	--- title: <i class="icon-icon-hdd"></i>Hosting ---
2013-01-25 15:24:11	mikeumus	but that's obviously not the right way to go about it. is that markdown at the top there or is it just text that docpad uses? 
2013-01-25 15:33:42	<--	kaspertidemann (~Kasper@2605ds2-bav.0.fullrate.dk) has quit (Quit: kaspertidemann)
2013-01-25 15:34:54	mikeumus	or would I haveto do that in the layout?
2013-01-25 15:35:56	supersym	it's yaml, the meta-data
2013-01-25 15:36:41	supersym	what 'icon' do you mean, the favicon of a site?
2013-01-25 15:37:11	supersym	you can set that dynamically, like a different one on every page
2013-01-25 15:38:17	supersym	if you'd have like a document with a meta-data field as ico: '/images/icons/icon1.ico'
2013-01-25 15:38:32	supersym	and then in the layout, where you have the HTML head
2013-01-25 15:39:04	supersym	<link rel="shortcut icon" type="image/x-icon" href="#{document.ico}">
2013-01-25 15:39:13	supersym	something like that
2013-01-25 15:39:45	supersym	but you'd need to have one in every document, or just merge them in say docpad.cson the same way you do "getTitle"
2013-01-25 15:40:06	supersym	to ensure you always have a default one, and only replace it when the document.ico has been set 
2013-01-25 15:41:17	supersym	so instead to write a helper like "getIcon" would be better

2013-01-25 16:03:03	mikeumus	I mean not the favicon but a icon next to a menu item, one of these icons: http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/base-css.html#icons
2013-01-25 16:03:48	<--	philhawksworth1 (~Adium@liverpool.rgai.co.uk) has quit (Client Quit)
2013-01-25 16:04:42	mikeumus	yeah no image rendering in yaml probably, alright I'll have to add them in the layout file somehow
2013-01-25 16:06:04	shac	mikeumus: I think what supersym explained should still work, except perhaps you can use the bootstrap icon class in the ico: meta-data field and retrieve it in your page layout.
2013-01-25 16:06:30	mikeumus	hum
2013-01-25 16:09:48	mikeumus	supersym was still talking about changing the website's favicon though right? I'm talking about adding a icon at before the document.title of a listed page in the header nav
2013-01-25 16:10:06	mikeumus	I'll deploy and show you
2013-01-25 16:10:37	shac	yeah, but the basic technique is the same, except you get the icon class in your page layout instead of setting the favicon path in the header
2013-01-25 16:11:25	mikeumus	ohh
2013-01-25 16:11:53	mikeumus	like using something like this in the yaml: #{document.ico} ?
2013-01-25 16:12:41	mikeumus	or
2013-01-25 16:12:41	shac	yeah so you could call your icon by doing <i class="#{document.ico}"></i> <Header goes here>
2013-01-25 16:13:35	shac	and set icon: icon-hdd  in your document header for each page
2013-01-25 16:13:54	shac	I should add that I've been using docpad for about a day so I could be totally wrong!

2013-01-25 16:18:11	mikeumus	Here's the menu in question: http://web-mart.me/
2013-01-25 16:18:18	mikeumus	Websites Hosting Domains
2013-01-25 16:18:48	mikeumus	trying to get that icon before each document.title, so I'll try taht
2013-01-25 16:19:44	shac	mikeumus: ahh, i the menu? Is it autogenerated?
2013-01-25 16:20:01	mikeumus	yes
2013-01-25 16:20:21	mikeumus	<% for document in @getCollection('pages').toJSON(): %>

2013-01-25 16:21:05	shac	you should still be able to access the icon there
2013-01-25 16:23:01	shac	just use <i class="<%= page.ico %>"></i> before (or in if you want it clickable) the <a href="<%= page.url %>"> and set ico: icon-hdd under your title: at the top of each page
2013-01-25 16:24:16	mikeumus	ok cool, thanks let me try it out
2013-01-25 16:34:32	mikeumus	docpad run -> ReferenceError: page is not defined
2013-01-25 16:35:00	shac	sorry, you should use document instead of page
2013-01-25 16:35:16	mikeumus	ohh alright
2013-01-25 16:35:42	shac	because of the <% for document in @getCollection('pages')... loop
2013-01-25 16:38:37	mikeumus	yeah, that worked 
2013-01-25 16:38:38	mikeumus	8)
2013-01-25 16:39:02	shac	good news!
2013-01-25 16:40:32	mikeumus	woo hoo! Thanks shac, pardon I'm such a noob.
2013-01-25 16:40:58	shac	haha, that's about all I know so now you know everything I do
2013-01-25 16:41:35	shac	and it was all supersym's suggestions :)
2013-01-25 16:41:41	mikeumus	8D
2013-01-25 16:42:00	mikeumus	yeah supersym is always helpful, thank you too!
2013-01-25 16:42:21	supersym	haha sorry i just got back :P
2013-01-25 16:42:22	shac	hopefully I saved them some work and helped myself understand it too, win win :)
2013-01-25 16:42:24	supersym	thanks ;0
2013-01-25 16:42:27	supersym	;)
2013-01-25 16:46:55	supersym	now i dont know what the solution was really, but you can do fun stuff with docpad, meta-data and CSS yeah
2013-01-25 16:47:28	supersym	like give a "content" element, say div..the ID of the document base name, and use CSS to rotate banners depending on the page you visit

2013-01-25 16:53:41	shac	it seems like a very flexible setup
2013-01-25 16:57:39	supersym	yeah...although you cant mixup meta-data with stylus or less yet
2013-01-25 16:57:53	supersym	you can still control the flow by dynamically naming the elements 
2013-01-25 16:57:57	supersym	the other way around :)
2013-01-25 16:58:20	supersym	just as good...maybe even better
2013-01-25 16:59:45	supersym	so I had a base style that applied to <div id="#{document.title}" class="content">content</div>
2013-01-25 17:00:31	supersym	and be smart to use CSS rules on when you can override stuff... use stylus to @extend those css rules
2013-01-25 17:01:07	supersym	because my designer friend thought it was 'nice' to have font size, colors differ etc
2013-01-25 17:01:51	supersym	if you are any good with CSS... I found myself using .html.md files more often in the end than .html.jade
2013-01-25 17:03:06	supersym	All I used was semantic.gs for positioning on the raster, have a set of colors and font sizes defined in a stylus file like $green $large
2013-01-25 17:04:58	supersym	using that and the base style of class 'content' and the dynamic names I could then easily override (fine-grained) and elements based on their name like h1#articles @extends h1.content
2013-01-25 17:05:52	supersym	no name conflicts, since each docpad document becomes its own file anyway,...each HTML documents with dynamic title, banner, theme if you like
2013-01-25 17:06:24	supersym	and I kept the amount of stylus in control which in the end still was like 2000 lines of stylus ><
2013-01-25 17:07:19	supersym	I perhaps could have better split the styles in seperate files... but I was optimizing for speed (= as few HTTP Get requests as possible) so 1 minimized CSS file was the result
2013-01-25 17:07:53	supersym	although if you work on a site often, it's advised to have not 1 .js and 1 .css but atleast split that into pieces that you change often and those that are more static
2013-01-25 17:07:59	-->	philhawksworth1 (~Adium@liverpool.rgai.co.uk) has joined #docpad
2013-01-25 17:08:01	shac	ah that's pretty interesting. I'm using Semantic.gs and Less, but same thing applies
2013-01-25 17:08:08	supersym	as your site matures and you find yourself changing stuff often 
2013-01-25 17:08:14	supersym	yeah :)
2013-01-25 17:08:32	supersym	its just basic CSS rules...if the class and id styles don't bite eachother
2013-01-25 17:08:44	supersym	else you follow the rules of CSS what gets applied
2013-01-25 17:08:53	shac	sounds good
2013-01-25 17:09:03	supersym	!important I never have to use :)
2013-01-25 17:09:18	shac	yeah, that's just good practice, right? haha
2013-01-25 17:09:27	supersym	but you do need to know a little about CSS,..livereload and a open browser/firebug is a good thing
2013-01-25 17:09:39	shac	yeah, can't live without reload now
2013-01-25 17:09:40	supersym	2 screens helps too :)
2013-01-25 17:09:44	supersym	its so good
2013-01-25 17:09:46	supersym	i know
2013-01-25 17:09:58	supersym	docpad the only site generator that implemented that flawless out of the box
2013-01-25 17:10:00	supersym	and I tried all
2013-01-25 17:10:06	shac	nice
2013-01-25 17:10:16	supersym	the rest I had to manually use Guardfiles etc
2013-01-25 17:10:19	supersym	in ruby
2013-01-25 17:11:08	supersym	yeah... it helps to have a learning plan tho.. i hadnt done web development in a few years
2013-01-25 17:11:31	shac	I've been building WordPress sites for years so I'm finding it fun to play with something new
2013-01-25 17:11:36	supersym	I bet :)
2013-01-25 17:11:50	supersym	I don't want anything else ... :)
2013-01-25 17:11:57	supersym	I dont like PHP anymore either
2013-01-25 17:11:58	shac	also played around a lot with Node and AngularJS, docpad seemed like a natural fit for me
2013-01-25 17:12:04	supersym	right
2013-01-25 17:12:15	supersym	and you have freedom of choice still
2013-01-25 17:12:21	supersym	what language etc to use
2013-01-25 17:12:28	shac	hah yeah, PHP is getting old. I used to do a bit of Codeigniter work
2013-01-25 17:12:32	supersym	it really complements tools like Ender and Grunt I think
2013-01-25 17:12:41	shac	yes, it's very cool how flexible it is
2013-01-25 17:12:52	shac	truly does "set you free" in that sense
2013-01-25 17:12:56	supersym	yep :)
2013-01-25 17:13:02	supersym	its not just a marketing pitch
2013-01-25 17:13:14	supersym	its genuine
2013-01-25 17:13:21	supersym	also I liked that the community is still small
2013-01-25 17:13:35	supersym	imagine 10,20 flooders like me in a channel :P
2013-01-25 17:13:41	shac	hahaha
2013-01-25 17:13:42	supersym	><
2013-01-25 17:15:28	supersym	Im just having so much fun now I learned a lot more about http, node, coffeescript...
2013-01-25 17:15:44	supersym	looking into REST API's a bit now... so many have them
2013-01-25 17:15:45	shac	new stuff is always good fun
2013-01-25 17:16:02	supersym	you know npm is implemented as a REST API? I didn't ...
2013-01-25 17:16:03	shac	yeah I have a bit of an obsession with Last.fm's API
2013-01-25 17:16:11	supersym	I seen that name
2013-01-25 17:16:15	supersym	pop up several places
2013-01-25 17:16:40	supersym	what does that do?
2013-01-25 17:16:40	shac	I didn't have any idea how npm was implemented
2013-01-25 17:17:03	supersym	http://registry.npmjs.org/docpad
2013-01-25 17:17:19	supersym	then with firebug/chrome extension to pretty print json :)
2013-01-25 17:17:34	supersym	btw there are soooo many nice github chrome extensions too
2013-01-25 17:17:42	supersym	I only learned that a few days ago
2013-01-25 17:17:44	shac	interesting
2013-01-25 17:17:51	shac	I mainly just use the command line
2013-01-25 17:18:01	supersym	samo...curl pwns :P
2013-01-25 17:18:43	supersym	I used only vim before but find myself liking Sublime a lot too
2013-01-25 17:19:02	shac	hah yeah Sublime is my weapon of choice
2013-01-25 17:19:36	supersym	it depends on what I have to do,...now I write pure node.js in there and Ctrl+Shift+B build
2013-01-25 17:20:02	supersym	in vim I always forget to do :!./% so I close the file and run it and then open again...so stupid ><
2013-01-25 17:20:08	urlwolf	I just left sublime behind
2013-01-25 17:20:13	urlwolf	using pycharm
2013-01-25 17:20:19	urlwolf	anything by intellij kills sublime
2013-01-25 17:20:20	supersym	*checking out*
2013-01-25 17:20:28	supersym	haha
2013-01-25 17:20:30	supersym	:)
2013-01-25 17:20:34	urlwolf	before sublime I was vim
2013-01-25 17:20:54	supersym	vim speed is just great the way you have insert, command modes
2013-01-25 17:20:56	urlwolf	they have a live edit plugin that is ridiculously better than anything else
2013-01-25 17:21:11	supersym	anything without that loses in terms if you have to modify many pieces in a single document
2013-01-25 17:21:18	urlwolf	plus inspections, autocompletion etc even works in css
2013-01-25 17:21:28	urlwolf	you have a vim plugin
2013-01-25 17:21:30	supersym	I guess I should use emacs when I am ready to learn Lisp
2013-01-25 17:21:36	supersym	yeah
2013-01-25 17:21:45	supersym	almost everything nowadays has a vim mode
2013-01-25 17:21:52	urlwolf	I use colemak, the vim arrow substitutes are not convenient
2013-01-25 17:21:52	supersym	except sublime i think ><
2013-01-25 17:22:12	supersym	another new name ... *G*
2013-01-25 17:22:19	shac	I think sublime call it "Vintage mode" heh
2013-01-25 17:22:21	urlwolf	seriously, try webstorm with liveedit
2013-01-25 17:22:30	supersym	aha
2013-01-25 17:22:38	supersym	lol
2013-01-25 17:22:47	urlwolf	it detects when a path is broken
2013-01-25 17:22:52	urlwolf	shows css colors
2013-01-25 17:23:14	urlwolf	is like comparing living in a city to a cabin in the woods (any other editor)
2013-01-25 17:23:35	supersym	is it free?
2013-01-25 17:23:42	urlwolf	no
2013-01-25 17:23:42	supersym	jetbrains usually $$
2013-01-25 17:23:47	shac	I use sublime for that reason, I think. It's lightweight and stays out of the way.
2013-01-25 17:23:48	supersym	yeah thats what I thought
2013-01-25 17:23:52	urlwolf	but about the price of sublime
2013-01-25 17:24:00	supersym	@shac yeah and it's "buy me
2013-01-25 17:24:09	supersym	just not irritating enough but borderline
2013-01-25 17:24:25	supersym	good momentum on when it pops marketing wise imho :P
2013-01-25 17:24:30	shac	haha, I paid for mine after about 6 months of hitting escape after saves
2013-01-25 17:24:36	supersym	:)
2013-01-25 17:24:46	urlwolf	sublime seems dead. author doesn't show up in the forum anymore
2013-01-25 17:24:56	supersym	that blows...
2013-01-25 17:25:03	shac	that's a shame, because it was moving so far
2013-01-25 17:25:05	shac	fast*
2013-01-25 17:25:13	shac	made his money?
2013-01-25 17:25:22	supersym	and no source the community can use I bet
2013-01-25 17:25:26	urlwolf	nope
2013-01-25 17:25:28	supersym	which is double fekked
2013-01-25 17:25:39	urlwolf	jetbrains is not a single guy
2013-01-25 17:25:46	supersym	oh well future is online IDE anyway
2013-01-25 17:25:50	urlwolf	I trust they will be alive in 5 yrs
2013-01-25 17:26:08	supersym	they will be obsolete then :P
2013-01-25 17:26:20	supersym	nah... I mean Jetbrains, they do make great tools
2013-01-25 17:26:27	supersym	their refactoring tool for Visual Studio
2013-01-25 17:26:33	supersym	phewww goood baby
2013-01-25 17:26:39	supersym	some freebies as well
2013-01-25 17:26:42	supersym	I dig that
2013-01-25 17:27:03	supersym	for sublime, its a shame since its full features for free and has many good plugins
2013-01-25 17:27:16	supersym	on Linux it's really that or Vim... and thats not for everyone
2013-01-25 17:27:30	supersym	on Windows...Notepad++ maybe :P

2013-01-25 17:28:20	supersym	there are a few community maintained open source web editors that could potentially evolve that way like Ace etc
2013-01-25 17:28:33	supersym	but much work still to be done
2013-01-25 17:28:58	shac	According to this: http://www.sublimetext.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=9888&p=39321#p39321 there is still work going on that is not suitable for 'incremental releases'
2013-01-25 17:29:03	shac	Nov 2012
2013-01-25 17:29:32	shac	The same thing happened to TextMate on the Mac
2013-01-25 17:29:47	shac	the creators abandoned it, and every slowly realsed it was dead and absconded to Sublime...
2013-01-25 17:29:54	supersym	comment from john_ferrier hits the nail with closed source
2013-01-25 17:29:59	shac	yes
2013-01-25 17:30:06	supersym	Mac is all about this sh!t
2013-01-25 17:30:12	supersym	$$$ baby
2013-01-25 17:30:37	shac	I went mac 2 years ago
2013-01-25 17:30:48	shac	after a lifetime of Windows
2013-01-25 17:30:49	supersym	I can imagine most people would
2013-01-25 17:30:58	supersym	but you use cli?
2013-01-25 17:31:05	supersym	why not go say Arch ;)
2013-01-25 17:31:19	shac	or rather, Windows with periodic attempts to convert to Lnux
2013-01-25 17:31:19	supersym	I guess you dont want the fuss...like most ppl
2013-01-25 17:31:40	shac	simply put: adobe stuff
2013-01-25 17:31:42	supersym	yeah took me some time too just like going from VBA/VB -> C#
2013-01-25 17:31:50	shac	I also do design work and audio
2013-01-25 17:31:53	supersym	right...just like my mate..designing stuff
2013-01-25 17:32:00	supersym	mac is the best for that
2013-01-25 17:32:13	supersym	oh well and atleast you have bash and can get zsh etc
2013-01-25 17:32:19	shac	honestly I dont think it makes much difference, but the combination of unix-like command line and adobe software is why i went to mac
2013-01-25 17:32:28	supersym	I'd hate to get stuck with PowerShell :(
2013-01-25 17:32:28	shac	yeah, zsh is awesome
2013-01-25 17:32:37	shac	hahaha
2013-01-25 17:32:48	supersym	I did install node.js and docpad on my gf
2013-01-25 17:32:53	supersym	's windows laptop
2013-01-25 17:32:56	shac	a mate of mine got a new windows ultrabook... within 2 weeks he was on Ubuntu because of fuckin' powershell and cygwin
2013-01-25 17:33:03	supersym	it works but still blows :P
2013-01-25 17:33:09	shac	hah yeah
2013-01-25 17:33:12	supersym	haha yep
2013-01-25 17:33:13	shac	what platform are you on then?
2013-01-25 17:33:50	supersym	Arch Linux now, after DOS->Windows->Debian->Ubuntu->Arch
2013-01-25 17:34:08	supersym	I tried some BSD now and then but I didnt get the idea behind package management
2013-01-25 17:34:10	shac	nice, Arch is nice? and no dodgy Amazon bullshit
2013-01-25 17:34:19	supersym	and RPM was lacking some stuff and cool tools
2013-01-25 17:34:27	supersym	plus I think RedHat = NSA
2013-01-25 17:34:46	supersym	ahhh man Arch is like the DocPad of Linux
2013-01-25 17:34:51	supersym	total freedom
2013-01-25 17:34:52	shac	nice
2013-01-25 17:35:09	supersym	and very 'simple' in a elegant/lean way
2013-01-25 17:35:34	supersym	but it's not for beginners, thats why I think Debian on a VPS is good for someone to learn like I did
2013-01-25 17:35:43	supersym	because Ubuntu already does too much for you
2013-01-25 17:36:15	shac	right
2013-01-25 17:36:54	supersym	and of course the ArchWiki and the entire principle of design
2013-01-25 17:37:32	supersym	they don't wrap some key control issues in needless abstractions in sake for 'user friendliness'
2013-01-25 17:37:52	supersym	in fact, I found myself often lacking information because of that it was doing things in the background
2013-01-25 17:37:55	shac	different goals i suppose
2013-01-25 17:38:09	supersym	also my boot times are great since it already has systemd like Fedora
2013-01-25 17:38:20	supersym	symlinks from /lib -> /usr/lib etc
2013-01-25 17:38:42	supersym	so I have my entire /usr split off
2013-01-25 17:39:16	supersym	on its own partition... I lost LVM because of the speed penalty but using GPT partition like 124 or so max nr of partitions per disk
2013-01-25 17:39:21	supersym	which is more then enough
2013-01-25 17:39:37	supersym	threw in a SSD and readahead,.... go baby go
2013-01-25 17:39:45	shac	heheh

2013-01-25 17:40:33	supersym	that is soo much fun
2013-01-25 17:40:47	supersym	the way I can draw bootcharts
2013-01-25 17:40:59	supersym	I would have never learned that stuff without Arch
2013-01-25 17:41:10	shac	heh interesting stuff
2013-01-25 17:41:27	supersym	because of their Wiki...now I look back at Ubuntu forums and often think "that is all wrong!" haha
2013-01-25 17:41:28	shac	"systemd is too complex to fully explain in this one page."
2013-01-25 17:41:33	supersym	:) :)
2013-01-25 17:43:21	supersym	first I used this for windowing http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiz_Fusion
2013-01-25 17:43:31	shac	hah i remember compiz
2013-01-25 17:43:34	supersym	with a custom kernel Brain Fuck Scheduler
2013-01-25 17:43:37	shac	wobbling windows and stuff
2013-01-25 17:43:50	supersym	so good responsiveness...had it on Xcfe
2013-01-25 17:43:53	supersym	yeah indeed
2013-01-25 17:44:06	supersym	...now I find a tiling manager better so I use Awesome
2013-01-25 17:44:12	supersym	there is work on a node.js WM tho
2013-01-25 17:44:24	supersym	https://github.com/mixu/nwm
2013-01-25 17:45:02	shac	huh interesting. Will it use web tech for the display stuff then?
2013-01-25 17:45:17	supersym	I guess node event drive I/O
2013-01-25 17:45:30	supersym	and C++ hooks to X
2013-01-25 17:45:36	supersym	bindings
2013-01-25 17:45:45	supersym	that stuff is just a bit over my level atm
2013-01-25 17:45:55	supersym	as I don't know much of any C/C++
2013-01-25 17:46:09	shac	yeah me neither
2013-01-25 17:47:02	supersym	anyway X has a standard interface so all you do is bind to them once and then
2013-01-25 17:47:13	supersym	you can use JavaScript instead of another language
2013-01-25 17:47:24	supersym	much like you customize Awesome in Lua
2013-01-25 17:47:38	supersym	functional languages are very nice to do this kind of scripting
2013-01-25 17:47:40	shac	clever
2013-01-25 17:47:46	supersym	just as easy as with creating a browser window
2013-01-25 17:47:50	supersym	but then on the desktop :)
2013-01-25 17:47:56	supersym	very customizable
2013-01-25 17:47:58	supersym	yep
2013-01-25 17:49:07	supersym	the only 'downside' to Arch is that it's rolling releases
2013-01-25 17:49:16	supersym	and those tend to be less suitable for servers
2013-01-25 17:49:39	supersym	not much testing and change happens before stuff gets in the official repository
2013-01-25 17:50:03	supersym	and many programs come through the Arch User Repository which are bash scripts that facilitate building from source
2013-01-25 17:50:29	supersym	so you can easily monitor some stuff, it warns you not to build as root, look at code and then hit "Yes"
2013-01-25 17:50:36	supersym	and it tries to fetch dependencies
2013-01-25 17:51:00	supersym	but companies want some more 'testing' to be more sure stuff wont die
2013-01-25 17:51:16	supersym	so a 4 year cycle, 6 year Long Term Support sounds better
2013-01-25 17:51:23	ashnur	http://egghead.io
2013-01-25 17:51:32	supersym	which means stuff will get security patches etc 
2013-01-25 17:51:51	supersym	@ashnur Nice :)
2013-01-25 17:52:19	supersym	i was thinking on doing some docpad video tutorials actually 
2013-01-25 17:52:38	supersym	i still don't "get" ALSA though :(
2013-01-25 17:53:18	supersym	i liked camtasia on windows and that my sound just works there
2013-01-25 17:53:37	supersym	that just blows in linux :(
2013-01-25 17:54:25	supersym	or its overly complicated better... they should shoot the ppl who wrote the --help of 'ip'
2013-01-25 17:55:30	supersym	there is a find line between "doing everything for the user" to "this is all symbols and abbreviations"
2013-01-25 17:55:38	supersym	*fine

2013-01-25 19:42:09	supersym	you could easily read out any address to a external API, read it in and generate your own derived collections ~> code objects like CoffeeScript classes
2013-01-25 19:42:37	supersym	imho docpad Plugin system for one, would ideally be exposed as REST
2013-01-25 19:43:18	supersym	one downside of going cloud instance with docpad is the machine and costs if it become popular/high traffic
2013-01-25 19:43:46	supersym	and I dont know if any PaaS offer good service like such a db for free
2013-01-25 19:44:02	supersym	else you could just use several free and tie them as load balancers / proxies together :)

2013-01-25 20:11:17	mikeumus	the script.js in the scripts folder of the bootstrap skeleton isn't doing anything I'm guessing?:
2013-01-25 20:11:18	mikeumus	(function() {    $(function() {});  }).call(this);
2013-01-25 20:11:28	mikeumus	or is it?
2013-01-25 20:12:33	mikeumus	looks all emptyish, but just wanted to check
2013-01-25 20:13:54	mikeumus	ohh it's actaully script.js.coffee
2013-01-25 20:14:02	supersym	its a stub i guess
2013-01-25 20:14:14	mikeumus	that means it's harmless to remove?
2013-01-25 20:14:16	supersym	anonymous function supposed to call itself
2013-01-25 20:14:19	supersym	yea
2013-01-25 20:14:51	mikeumus	coffeescript, which leads to the next question, can you write stuff like YUI code in coffeescript ?
2013-01-25 20:14:54	supersym	it somewhere you could put your javascript/coffeescript
2013-01-25 20:15:03	supersym	what is YUI code
2013-01-25 20:15:12	supersym	a library right?
2013-01-25 20:15:16	supersym	ofc...
2013-01-25 20:15:30	supersym	you just need to include it either in the document head script tag
2013-01-25 20:15:32	mikeumus	 http://yuilibrary.com/
2013-01-25 20:15:58	supersym	yeah jquery-like
2013-01-25 20:16:34	mikeumus	I have YUI loading from the default theme, is that same thing as having it in the document head script tag or it that the same thing?
2013-01-25 20:16:37	supersym	maybe you dont even need to put it in the head
2013-01-25 20:16:46	supersym	and can use getScript from docpad
2013-01-25 20:16:58	supersym	theme?
2013-01-25 20:17:03	supersym	layout you mean?
2013-01-25 20:18:10	supersym	YUI quickstart says: // Put the YUI seed file on your page.
2013-01-25 20:18:13	supersym	nothing more
2013-01-25 20:18:16	mikeumus	yeah very simular syntactically, but you can easiy extend YUI's power by just including different YUI().use('extentions/modules') and it's all by Yahoo and just works. 
2013-01-25 20:18:27	supersym	so I say you might be able to load the JS anywhere you like
2013-01-25 20:18:39	supersym	ahhh yeah
2013-01-25 20:18:47	supersym	i think I've seen it before
2013-01-25 20:19:35	mikeumus	supposably the YUI node.js module uses jsdom and you can do element selection ect.. from the server side but I haven't tried it out too much yet

2013-01-25 20:21:08	supersym	yeah
2013-01-25 20:21:23	supersym	so do you want server or client... since: However, there is no DOM support included in our releases. This means that you can not do DOM manipulation on the server with this core system.
2013-01-25 20:21:50	supersym	so treat client-browser side as you would with say jQuery
2013-01-25 20:21:51	mikeumus	yeah I was thinking server would be more expensive anyways
2013-01-25 20:21:54	mikeumus	but I don't really know
2013-01-25 20:21:54	supersym	yup
2013-01-25 20:22:09	mikeumus	what I'm doing doesn't have to be server anyways so I figured to just go clientside for now
2013-01-25 20:22:25	supersym	my last docpad site was entire static
2013-01-25 20:22:36	supersym	a lot of things you can use Browserify also

2013-01-25 20:25:13	mikeumus	hum
2013-01-25 20:25:22	supersym	its so nice and easy if you know some SQL basics
2013-01-25 20:25:33	mikeumus	yeah
2013-01-25 20:25:36	supersym	and you can just set a website as target
2013-01-25 20:25:47	supersym	and use CSS selectors to fetch data as a JSON or XML

2013-01-25 20:37:42	supersym	or something like that ... so easy :P
2013-01-25 20:39:21	supersym	no xdomain issues or iframes for certain things if you worry about its security
2013-01-25 20:40:08	supersym	you could use a vimeo video iframe, which I did with the last site, but might as well just fish out the urls from their API and play them inside your own distributed HTML5 or Flash video player
2013-01-25 20:40:28	supersym	the options are near limitless :)
2013-01-25 20:40:43	supersym	neway dinner time .. afk ^^

2013-01-25 21:03:19	mikeumus_	sorry I closed the window, I have YUI in <%- getBlock('scripts')... %> but I'm getting YUI not defined error, how did you recommend to do it also?
2013-01-25 21:07:11	supersym	yeah well that'll load it deferred
2013-01-25 21:07:38	supersym	check your browser page source to see how getBlock generates script tags
2013-01-25 21:07:47	supersym	http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/articles/hosting/?connection&json&paginator&datatable&MIN#configure
2013-01-25 21:07:49	mikeumus_	k
2013-01-25 21:07:55	supersym	you need to be looking at something like that
2013-01-25 21:08:49	supersym	so you load dom script modules from their host and provide their api with the stuff you want in
2013-01-25 21:09:11	supersym	like you do with http://modernizr.com/download etc
2013-01-25 21:10:02	supersym	i think thats the easiest in this case
2013-01-25 21:10:38	supersym	its the same problem you face as with jquery, there are a few cli tools that allow you to select components from a multi-module library/framework
2013-01-25 21:10:58	supersym	but more often you'll find their custom downloads through a web interface easier
2013-01-25 21:11:55	supersym	you can then always download the file they make and upload it to your server, or just follow the browser to their remote url and then save that css/javascript if you don't want external domain for your js/stylesheets
2013-01-25 21:12:25	supersym	CDN is often a lot faster though for visitors since many sites use them, their site visitors browser will recognize and cache the library from local
2013-01-25 21:12:54	supersym	but i doubt that will do much in your case
2013-01-25 21:13:17	supersym	it's a good solution for the full Twitter Bootstrap CSS minimized etc. or entire jQuery core lib
2013-01-25 21:13:51	supersym	but to add jQuery modules you'd add another <script> tag
2013-01-25 21:14:09	supersym	here you build a dynamic uri string so thats a lot cleaner imho
2013-01-25 21:14:49	mikeumus_	hum
2013-01-25 21:14:54	supersym	since not an aweful lot of sites use YUI you can select modules for pages specifically and only load on page visit
2013-01-25 21:15:08	mikeumus_	good points, so what does the deter attribute do in the script tag?
2013-01-25 21:15:08	supersym	or just fetch all at once in the docpad layout
2013-01-25 21:15:19	supersym	else you could inject that URL from say document meta-data
2013-01-25 21:15:29	mikeumus_	yeah
2013-01-25 21:15:42	supersym	http://davidwalsh.name/script-defer
2013-01-25 21:15:49	supersym	The deferred SCRIPT element's code will execute once the rest of the page's resources have loaded.  
2013-01-25 21:16:10	supersym	sometimes that is good... you used to place at the foot of the HTML document
2013-01-25 21:16:21	supersym	but stuff like jQuery won't work most times like that
2013-01-25 21:16:39	mikeumus_	that's a pretty cool trick
2013-01-25 21:16:43	mikeumus_	hum
2013-01-25 21:16:47	supersym	it needs to have certain things in the tree I guess before the DOM loads
2013-01-25 21:17:01	supersym	im not sure about the exact mechanics behind all that
2013-01-25 21:17:51	supersym	with getBlock scripts btw...livereload wont work
2013-01-25 21:18:09	supersym	because docpad uses it to inject into the domtree for socket.io livereload
2013-01-25 21:18:22	supersym	and other plugins might require that as well to hook into your browser
2013-01-25 21:18:40	supersym	so it's always good to place it inside the layout, even if you don't add scripts to it
2013-01-25 21:19:09	supersym	I found that after I was wondering for a week why livereload stopped working :P
2013-01-25 21:20:11	mikeumus_	yeah it stopped working for me today
2013-01-25 21:20:23	mikeumus_	but the YUI is working coffee style, sweet!!
2013-01-25 21:20:29	supersym	:D
2013-01-25 21:20:33	supersym	nice
2013-01-25 21:20:45	mikeumus_	and livereload is one of the best things too, saves time. 
2013-01-25 21:20:55	supersym	hell yea no more F5
2013-01-25 21:21:11	mikeumus_	if you have two tabs open to the website it breaks though?
2013-01-25 21:21:30	supersym	even worked decent with stylus save rerender on occasion
2013-01-25 21:21:41	mikeumus_	also no more having to copy firebug,inspector changes to the source code
2013-01-25 21:21:42	supersym	I never experienced that I think
2013-01-25 21:22:15	supersym	yea I never really got used to firebug extension that much
2013-01-25 21:22:38	supersym	dumb placement of buttons/fields although inspecting computed styles and DOM nodes was nice
2013-01-25 21:22:47	supersym	would often enough hint me something missing from the tree]
2013-01-25 21:22:55	supersym	also tracing events is cool
2013-01-25 21:23:24	supersym	but with livereload and docpad parser
2013-01-25 21:23:37	supersym	I would often be alarmed real-time i made a boo boo
2013-01-25 21:23:44	supersym	and could fix it on the spot
2013-01-25 21:24:07	supersym	stylus,jade indent mistake? I save often so usually around 5-10 lines back
2013-01-25 21:24:53	supersym	compare that to copy/paste tons of CSS and then backtrack where its computing styles the wrong way
2013-01-25 21:25:14	supersym	imho the biggest pain ever, after learning stupid block element float stuff
2013-01-25 21:25:43	supersym	some rules are just weird / stupid :P
2013-01-25 21:26:57	mikeumus_	yeah
2013-01-25 21:27:31	mikeumus_	I'm thinking of a plugin that on-save cleans all semi-colons from a .styl file
2013-01-25 21:28:01	mikeumus_	just to keep the styl file nice and clean looking and that way you can just work and not worry about it
2013-01-25 21:28:36	mikeumus_	now that I got docpad online, this is the first time I've used Stylus but it's also quite nice
2013-01-25 21:28:45	supersym	I dont write semi-colons anymore
2013-01-25 21:28:59	supersym	and a lot I found css2stylus also good enough
2013-01-25 21:29:04	supersym	but like html2jade a bit buggy
2013-01-25 21:29:16	supersym	nothing incorrectable though and if its a ton of code
2013-01-25 21:29:47	supersym	in the end I got quite quick rewriting larger portions and using &:pseudo or &.class stuff
2013-01-25 21:30:04	supersym	its gonna regenerate the same CSS in the end but makes for nicer maintenance
2013-01-25 21:30:22	supersym	same reason @imports etc are handy, better file organization
2013-01-25 21:30:37	supersym	but in the end it doesnt matter and thats real kind of stylus
2013-01-25 21:30:42	supersym	you can just mixin CSS
2013-01-25 21:30:49	supersym	smooth sailing
2013-01-25 21:32:15	supersym	I found myself writing very long chains in stylus tho
2013-01-25 21:32:37	supersym	keep in mind that if you hit another #id that you break it off on the indent
2013-01-25 21:33:10	supersym	just like #some > a > #another > .doesnt make sense
2013-01-25 21:33:30	supersym	you can just do #another > .does make sense
2013-01-25 21:34:46	supersym	with semantic.gs... my final html output as clean and semantic as a whistle... no div tags anywhere to be found anymore
2013-01-25 21:34:46	-->	woah (~smuxi@216-75-227-234.static.wiline.com) has joined #docpad
2013-01-25 21:36:28	supersym	since its also your first time with stylus: know to look around github to find say Twitter Bootstrap stylus, modular .styl files you can use
2013-01-25 21:36:35	supersym	also Foundation as stylus version
2013-01-25 21:36:37	supersym	and a few others
2013-01-25 21:36:49	supersym	all have like 10-20 files cleanly seperated
2013-01-25 21:37:06	supersym	buttons.styl fonts.styl and so on
2013-01-25 21:37:15	supersym	pretty nifty
2013-01-25 21:47:36	mikeumus_	hum, thanks for the tips
2013-01-25 21:48:11	mikeumus_	So I have this in my yui coffeescript and it's not doing what it looks like it should. It's saying there isn't a on() for the second one as a error: http://jsfiddle.net/jnR8t/
2013-01-25 21:48:53	mikeumus_	however js2coffee.org shows that it's what I'm thinking it shoudl be, a chained .on() function
2013-01-25 21:53:25	supersym	you'll need to use brackets I think
2013-01-25 21:53:29	supersym	().on()
2013-01-25 21:55:12	supersym	from what i experienced with coffeescript you can leave the brackets away with a method, but once you start chaining that stuff you'll need them to make explicit that its supposed to be together
2013-01-25 21:55:52	supersym	like server.run(doStuff() { .. } ).listen 1337
2013-01-25 21:56:02	supersym	is an ok way to do that
2013-01-25 21:56:26	supersym	that doStuff could be many lines of code ofc
2013-01-25 21:56:52	mikeumus_	ok I see, thanks
2013-01-25 21:58:24	supersym	cs is lateron supposed to support some.methodA "paramA1", "paramA2" .methodB "paramB1" etc
2013-01-25 21:58:30	supersym	but atm doesnt work like that
2013-01-25 22:03:17	mikeumus_	cs is retuning like everyting too in it's generated code
2013-01-25 22:04:12	supersym	yep
2013-01-25 22:04:51	supersym	thats how its intended...as statements with return value
2013-01-25 22:05:00	supersym	like it or hate it...
2013-01-25 22:05:04	supersym	often I fi
2013-01-25 22:05:23	supersym	i dont mind the sacrifice for cleaner OOP syntax
2013-01-25 22:05:27	mikeumus_	it is just trying to cover itself as a catch-all so it doesn't miss returning something or does cs use it for something else as well?
2013-01-25 22:06:20	supersym	i dont know but guess it just makes for cleaner language and since many variables used to point to functions returning values anyway
2013-01-25 22:06:50	supersym	also you dont risk missing var declarations
2013-01-25 22:07:14	supersym	everything is own wrapped function so you dont polute the global namespace
2013-01-25 22:09:10	supersym	log = (args...) -> console.log args...
2013-01-25 22:09:22	supersym	that is fun to see how it generates JS from coffee :)
2013-01-25 22:09:24	mikeumus_	hum
2013-01-25 22:10:00	supersym	(function() {
2013-01-25 22:10:00	supersym	  var log,
2013-01-25 22:10:33	supersym	= less chance someone can exploit that in your code, its safer, and less chance to colide with other apps/variable names
2013-01-25 22:10:45	supersym	so I find this good practice and actually a Plus for CS
2013-01-25 22:11:12	supersym	others think different and just want to make that up for themselves
2013-01-25 22:13:44	supersym	anyway it makes working with asynchronous callbacks a lot easier
2013-01-25 22:13:59	supersym	and since node.js is really about that as well
2013-01-25 22:18:29	woah	hey supersym, you helped me out with some tips on using jade in docpad- finally gotten back around to the project where i needed those
2013-01-25 22:18:42	woah	trying to load some js in a document
2013-01-25 22:18:44	woah	(not)
2013-01-25 22:18:46	woah	layout
2013-01-25 22:19:14	woah	!= this.getBlock("scripts").add(["vendor/jquery-1-9-0-min.js", "vendor/slabtext.js", "scripts/scripts.js", "//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/webfont/1.1.2/webfont.js"]).toHTML();
2013-01-25 22:19:31	woah	trying that, but it is not able to access the getBlock method
2013-01-25 22:20:00	woah	i can of course just link to the file directly with regular html
2013-01-25 22:22:13	supersym	hmm
2013-01-25 22:22:25	supersym	this?
2013-01-25 22:22:31	supersym	!= getBlock()
2013-01-25 22:24:11	supersym	https://github.com/docpad/twitter-bootstrap-jade.docpad/blob/master/src/layouts/default.html.jade
2013-01-25 22:24:21	supersym	or you could use that method
2013-01-25 22:24:40	woah	thanks!
2013-01-25 22:24:48	supersym	but look below the file https://github.com/docpad/twitter-bootstrap-jade.docpad/blob/master/src/layouts/default.html.jade#L42
2013-01-25 22:24:50	woah	yea i was trying to do what i now realize was stupid
2013-01-25 22:24:51	supersym	at how that is used
2013-01-25 22:24:54	supersym	:)
2013-01-25 22:25:02	woah	was trying to load the script block in a document
2013-01-25 22:25:10	supersym	you can put them all in 1 array or seperated like the jade skeleton
2013-01-25 22:25:20	supersym	its a matter of taste / code organization that you prefer
2013-01-25 22:25:28	supersym	gl :)
2013-01-25 22:25:39	woah	:)
2013-01-25 22:29:30	supersym	only thing that sucks about jade is no multiline js , you have to do - everytime or use ;
2013-01-25 22:31:07	supersym	in coffee too btw so log = (args...) -> console.log args... ; console.log "hello" --- is just perfectly fine :)
2013-01-25 22:32:22	supersym	log = (args...) -> console.log "hello"; (args...) -> console.log args... --- also works :)
2013-01-25 22:32:43	supersym	one-liners FTW :P
2013-01-25 22:34:26	-->	urlwolf (~quassel@e179047128.adsl.alicedsl.de) has joined #docpad
2013-01-25 22:34:38	woah	yea lol its the cost we pay for whitespace sensitivity
2013-01-25 22:34:46	supersym	yup :)
2013-01-25 22:34:53	woah	be nice if there was some sort of newline char
2013-01-25 22:34:59	woah	just for the interpreter
2013-01-25 22:35:07	supersym	right :)
2013-01-25 22:35:49	supersym	well that and with Jade its TJ Hollowaychuck who doesnt feel like adding it
2013-01-25 22:36:27	-->	kdisgn (~klabs@net-93-65-242-159.cust.dsl.vodafone.it) has joined #docpad
2013-01-25 22:36:58	supersym	the thing is that using - for x in getCollection('html').toJSON() works
2013-01-25 22:37:04	supersym	as - buffers it
2013-01-25 22:37:17	supersym	you could use some symbol to denote multiline
2013-01-25 22:37:46	supersym	but its also easily mixed up with :coffeescript like filters which in Jade JavaScript would be 
2013-01-25 22:38:01	supersym	just script \n \whitespace and then your code
2013-01-25 22:38:22	supersym	since html5 doesnt require <script type="javascript/text"> anymore
2013-01-25 22:38:26	supersym	just <script> will do
2013-01-25 22:38:37	supersym	but thats all client/browserside code
2013-01-25 22:38:53	supersym	and thus it doesnt know/do anything with docpad variables like getCollection()
2013-01-25 22:39:09	supersym	I had that mixed up a few times
2013-01-25 22:39:50	supersym	it becomes hairy if you have like js code for say a slider module
2013-01-25 22:40:03	supersym	it would inject in computed CSS tree
2013-01-25 22:40:14	woah	interesting
2013-01-25 22:40:24	woah	isnt that what you wanted?
2013-01-25 22:40:29	supersym	the best rule still is...don't use inline CSS/JS
2013-01-25 22:40:44	woah	yea no reason to
2013-01-25 22:40:58	woah	unless it is programmatically injected
2013-01-25 22:41:05	supersym	its still a bad idea just like in the old days
2013-01-25 22:41:10	supersym	yep
2013-01-25 22:41:32	supersym	the thing with the slider is that it would place resources, like vimeo videos inside its array
2013-01-25 22:41:44	supersym	and I want to control these from docpad meta-data
2013-01-25 22:41:52	woah	ah
2013-01-25 22:41:54	supersym	but it would not inject every vimeo iframe
2013-01-25 22:41:56	supersym	because of load times
2013-01-25 22:42:00	supersym	so it was a big pain
2013-01-25 22:42:12	woah	well you could have a wrapper func that gets a var from the metadata right?
2013-01-25 22:42:13	supersym	because i wanted it to have 2 videos in the same slide
2013-01-25 22:42:17	supersym	and then i got lost :D
2013-01-25 22:42:21	woah	and switches out some slider setting based on it?
2013-01-25 22:42:45	supersym	I could have hacked into that module somehow and change its source but it would have taken me too long at the time to understand that persons code
2013-01-25 22:42:51	supersym	my JS was even worse then
2013-01-25 22:42:55	supersym	and i was on a deadline
2013-01-25 22:42:55	woah	lol
2013-01-25 22:42:59	woah	happens

2013-01-25 22:44:25	woah	its pretty cool
2013-01-25 22:44:35	woah	better than coffeekup
2013-01-25 22:44:42	woah	but i still need to use jade for work
2013-01-25 22:44:48	woah	not quite full featured enough
2013-01-25 22:45:01	supersym	oh that looks nice
2013-01-25 22:45:05	supersym	a lot like coffeekup
2013-01-25 22:45:28	woah	yea, just a bit different
2013-01-25 22:45:49	woah	I read today that paul graham used lisp templating for viaweb
2013-01-25 22:45:55	woah	i want to see those lol!
2013-01-25 22:46:14	supersym	you know Clojure One?
2013-01-25 22:46:35	supersym	https://github.com/brentonashworth/one
2013-01-25 22:47:51	supersym	https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript
2013-01-25 22:48:17	supersym	I was wondering earlier if you could then do CS <> JS <> ClojureScript
2013-01-25 22:48:38	supersym	thats the only Lisp for the web that I know of anyway
2013-01-25 22:51:46	woah	i mean js is kind of a lisp for the web
2013-01-25 22:51:55	woah	but they were using it serverside
2013-01-25 22:52:15	woah	lisp i mean
2013-01-25 22:52:47	supersym	yeah but no code-is-data though
2013-01-25 22:53:12	woah	i mean in js, functions are objects
2013-01-25 22:53:15	woah	so its kinda there
2013-01-25 22:53:21	supersym	someone was even thinking of significant white-space lisp
2013-01-25 22:53:25	woah	yea!
2013-01-25 22:53:28	supersym	but i dont think many people will want that :P
2013-01-25 22:53:30	woah	that would be helpful
2013-01-25 22:53:35	supersym	lisp programmers are already hard to find anyway
2013-01-25 22:53:53	woah	so many parentheses
2013-01-25 22:53:59	supersym	haha yeah
2013-01-25 22:54:05	supersym	i think its pretty though
2013-01-25 22:54:16	supersym	but it can become a bit much and since most apply style spacing anyway
2013-01-25 22:54:22	supersym	you could make that a rule
2013-01-25 22:59:18	woah	define
2013-01-25 22:59:23	woah	  square x
2013-01-25 22:59:31	woah	    * x x
2013-01-25 22:59:39	woah	could be cool
2013-01-25 23:01:41	supersym	:D
2013-01-25 23:02:48	supersym	its for precise ppl anyway... but not very readable in nested functions i fear
2013-01-25 23:03:00	mikeumus_	images go in the files folder?
2013-01-25 23:03:04	supersym	in that respect, the -> does help out in coffeescript at  times
2013-01-25 23:03:11	supersym	@mike yeah I'd say
2013-01-25 23:03:21	supersym	dont see use of them in documents/
2013-01-25 23:03:36	supersym	static = non-rendering = files
2013-01-25 23:03:37	mikeumus_	can I create like a img folder for them/
2013-01-25 23:03:41	mikeumus_	?
2013-01-25 23:03:54	supersym	also goes for .js that doesnt have to be converted from coffeescript to js
2013-01-25 23:04:05	supersym	you can create any folder structure you like
2013-01-25 23:04:25	mikeumus_	8D, twas a silly question but like to be sure
2013-01-25 23:04:27	supersym	sometimes you might want to keep them in their logical place
2013-01-25 23:04:39	supersym	like vendor/brandname/plugin/images
2013-01-25 23:04:57	supersym	if those are images that belong to a certain plugin
2013-01-25 23:05:08	supersym	but images/ for site wide stuff would do
2013-01-25 23:05:14	supersym	or themes/sometheme/images
2013-01-25 23:05:21	supersym	depends on how you use it
2013-01-25 23:05:34	-->	mikeumus (457dce03@gateway/web/freenode/ip.69.125.206.3) has joined #docpad
2013-01-25 23:05:35	supersym	if you want to name it foo because it makes sense... do so:)
2013-01-25 23:05:48	mikeumus	just got disconnected from irc for like a few there
2013-01-25 23:05:53	mikeumus	don't know why that happens
2013-01-25 23:05:59	mikeumus	in webchat.freenode sometimes
2013-01-25 23:06:05	supersym	oh ok i masked the quit/join messages here
2013-01-25 23:06:11	supersym	so i dont notice them :P
2013-01-25 23:06:29	supersym	last time i tried freenode webchat it didnt work at all for me
2013-01-25 23:07:17	supersym	so you cant read back your buffer? in short my answer was "depends what you use your images for"
2013-01-25 23:07:27	supersym	but its whatever you like :P
2013-01-25 23:07:58	supersym	you can even rename files,documents,layouts folder names
2013-01-25 23:08:02	supersym	if you tell docpad
2013-01-25 23:08:13	supersym	my last site was entirely semantic dutch :P
2013-01-25 23:08:28	mikeumus	nice
2013-01-25 23:08:35	supersym	except the html5 element/attribute names but with Jade and class/id names I could play a lot
2013-01-25 23:08:48	<--	mikeumus_ (457dce03@gateway/web/freenode/ip.69.125.206.3) has quit (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
2013-01-25 23:09:10	supersym	a.small.button is so nice :)
2013-01-25 23:13:23	supersym	and I found it also a good idea to name 
2013-01-25 23:14:19	supersym	"obvious" things like #green.background if I had lookup and change code around them often
2013-01-25 23:15:12	supersym	i'd find it quicker than to name them by functionality like form.contact
2013-01-25 23:16:19	mikeumus	and it's /files/img/img/png to access them from a styl file say?
2013-01-25 23:16:26	mikeumus	img.png*
2013-01-25 23:17:02	supersym	no
2013-01-25 23:17:11	supersym	img/ is at the root
2013-01-25 23:17:16	supersym	look at out/ for that
2013-01-25 23:17:22	mikeumus	ohh
2013-01-25 23:17:27	supersym	it generates folders under documents/ files/ and throws them together
2013-01-25 23:17:29	mikeumus	I see
2013-01-25 23:17:37	supersym	but
2013-01-25 23:17:44	supersym	for render/design time builds
2013-01-25 23:17:53	supersym	you might use the "docpad path"
2013-01-25 23:18:02	supersym	../files/img/something.png
2013-01-25 23:18:23	supersym	there are some functions that can also help with it and translating relative/absolute path
2013-01-25 23:18:40	supersym	plus a plugin that helps to add the entire domain in front (some hosts like that)
2013-01-25 23:18:46	supersym	if i remember correctly
2013-01-25 23:18:51	supersym	for like github pages
2013-01-25 23:19:27	mikeumus	hum
2013-01-25 23:19:32	supersym	so you can see already
2013-01-25 23:19:38	supersym	be wary for name conflicts
2013-01-25 23:19:53	supersym	e.g. documents/script.coffee and files/script.js
2013-01-25 23:20:08	supersym	because the coffee renders to .js and dropped in out/script.js
2013-01-25 23:20:12	supersym	so will files/script.js
2013-01-25 23:20:30	supersym	now i dont know if it overwrite or error but not good anyway
2013-01-25 23:22:27	woah	lol templates are messin with my templates
2013-01-25 23:22:39	woah	gonna use jq templates for some limited things on the front
2013-01-25 23:22:47	woah	but can't write them well in jade
2013-01-25 23:22:58	supersym	what are jquery templates?
2013-01-25 23:23:13	supersym	boilerplates?
2013-01-25 23:23:40	woah	jquery can load html templates from inside a script tag
2013-01-25 23:23:48	woah	i guess i can just write em in the js
2013-01-25 23:23:57	supersym	ah ok
2013-01-25 23:24:04	woah	text replacement from db
2013-01-25 23:24:10	woah	actually from google doc
2013-01-25 23:24:13	woah	tabletop.js
2013-01-25 23:24:17	supersym	ah ok...injection :)
2013-01-25 23:24:22	supersym	thats nice
2013-01-25 23:24:37	supersym	you could render less/coffee client side also
2013-01-25 23:24:45	woah	yea doing a conference website and the list of attendees is continually updated as people accept
2013-01-25 23:25:01	woah	wanna cut down on the dependecies
2013-01-25 23:25:03	supersym	dropbox dl.dropbox.com/2r432r9 stuff also works as public viewable content
2013-01-25 23:25:12	supersym	nice ;)
2013-01-25 23:25:25	supersym	google forms?
2013-01-25 23:25:29	woah	yea
2013-01-25 23:25:32	woah	nop
2013-01-25 23:25:35	woah	spreadsheets
2013-01-25 23:25:41	supersym	also works :)
2013-01-25 23:25:41	woah	https://github.com/jsoma/tabletop
2013-01-25 23:25:57	supersym	this is fun too...https://www.google.com/fusiontables/DataSource?snapid=S283929Jw2s
2013-01-25 23:27:05	woah	damn
2013-01-25 23:28:07	supersym	vizualize is cool... then you can easily port edges to like neo4j or orientdb I think
2013-01-25 23:30:05	supersym	oh no..labs that is oh well either its all sweetness for more statistical data
2013-01-25 23:30:34	supersym	imma go apply for a part time job at google adworks nearby i think, friend refered me
2013-01-25 23:30:53	supersym	so I check out those tools a bit... they've been busy
2013-01-25 23:32:38	supersym	for docpad I am so inclined to think much stuff like these links we'd want to share on a greater scale then just pasting them in IRC or under docpad.org "nifties
2013-01-25 23:33:05	supersym	but more as serving up "opinionated" lists of online services/assets per category
2013-01-25 23:33:30	supersym	because there are so many cool things in the cloud you can hook up with docpad or any other site without much pain
2013-01-25 23:33:42	supersym	that it hardly justifies writing a plugin in some cases
2013-01-25 23:33:59	supersym	but you still wouldn't want to have the 'world' (our user-base) miss out on
2013-01-25 23:35:14	supersym	either per category like say "docpad-plugin-encryption" (might even make for a eventual candidate core module)
2013-01-25 23:35:41	supersym	but its gonna be the big-names that will draw most attention first like docpad-plugin-googledrive
2013-01-25 23:36:22	supersym	there are just so many ways you can mash-up a good web site with 3rd party API/data/streams/assets
2013-01-25 23:36:56	supersym	anyway... my mind wonders off again
2013-01-25 23:36:58	supersym	:P
2013-01-25 23:37:39	supersym	i guess the question also is: "can you make it interact with docpad (rendering) process directly"
2013-01-25 23:38:24	supersym	for the rest you could also have the "out of the box working stand-alone additionals" like Grunt to be demonstrated in skeletons
2013-01-25 23:38:48	supersym	same goes for tabletop working in your client-side browser without docpad interference
2013-01-25 23:39:04	supersym	sometimes it just seems a shame not sharing with other ppl the good stuff out there
2013-01-25 23:39:09	supersym	but that could just be me
2013-01-25 23:39:47	supersym	and that few ppl ever seem to read documentation, let alone a list of "good links to use with docpad"
2013-01-25 23:40:32	supersym	you'd want to shuv it in their face a bit more perhaps like on docpad run already refer to a "docpad list skeletons" and "docpad list plugins" and "docpad list linktips"
2013-01-25 23:40:47	supersym	esp. if that list of skeletons gets much larger
2013-01-25 23:41:12	supersym	even cooler:
2013-01-25 23:42:06	woah	but i think that's too broad
2013-01-25 23:42:21	woah	and shouldnt go in the stdout of docpad run
2013-01-25 23:42:35	supersym	i read somewhere you shouldnt try to keep up with webdev anymore
2013-01-25 23:42:41	<--	shannonmoeller (~shannonmo@pool-98-117-169-55.bflony.fios.verizon.net) has quit (Remote host closed the connection)
2013-01-25 23:42:47	supersym	now I like to think I know many JS libs out there
2013-01-25 23:42:51	woah	hacker news is good for keeping up
2013-01-25 23:42:53	supersym	but the web is just too big :S
2013-01-25 23:42:59	supersym	yeah
2013-01-25 23:43:24	woah	i've stopped paying attention to the "growth hackers" on there
2013-01-25 23:43:29	woah	but the technical links are good
2013-01-25 23:43:40	supersym	i end up there google searching now and then
2013-01-25 23:43:46	supersym	when they first reported something :)
2013-01-25 23:44:20	supersym	well my questions are from a design/architecture philosophical nature I guess
2013-01-25 23:44:35	supersym	but its still a valid question I guess
2013-01-25 23:44:45	supersym	and says something about the nature of the web currently as well
2013-01-25 23:45:03	supersym	one-page apps/websites static/dynamic borders are shifting
2013-01-25 23:48:32	supersym	http://www.rationalsurvivability.com/blog/wp-content/media/2009/01/cloudtaxonomyontology_v15.jpg
2013-01-25 23:48:34	supersym	that was 2009
2013-01-25 23:49:26	supersym	on the other hand,...those well-established wont easily change stuff in their core (REST) API's
2013-01-25 23:50:53	supersym	the thing really might be, that with docpad you can do as much, as you can do with node.js
2013-01-25 23:51:37	supersym	and it really depends on the platform you run docpad in what puts limitations in use like bandwidth,worker threads, memory you have available etc, restrictions on i/o
2013-01-25 23:52:24	supersym	trying to cover every angle in how you could make it work with everything and anything is a bit, much, yeah
2013-01-25 23:55:20	woah	wellll
2013-01-25 23:55:24	woah	i wouldnt say so
2013-01-25 23:55:41	woah	docpad makes it easy to get something up
2013-01-25 23:56:02	woah	if ur building a serious app, it's probably better to go with a clean express install
2013-01-25 23:56:55	supersym	right
2013-01-25 23:56:58	supersym	thats true
2013-01-25 23:57:37	supersym	http://www.cappuccino-project.org/ also seems nice
2013-01-25 23:57:51	supersym	if you are more geared towards desktop
2013-01-26 00:00:05	supersym	but usually you get stuck with that 'framework' you choose...
2013-01-26 00:00:17	supersym	express...is very nice, I admit
2013-01-26 00:00:43	supersym	I also really liked this one: https://github.com/flatiron/director
2013-01-26 00:01:30	supersym	doesnt even need server instance :)
2013-01-26 00:02:52	woah	cool will check out
2013-01-26 00:02:53	woah	hey 
2013-01-26 00:03:01	woah	so i'm making a template in jade
2013-01-26 00:03:03	supersym	but for serious stuff, you'll indeed want atleast some of http://www.senchalabs.org/connect/
2013-01-26 00:03:04	woah	to be read by jq
2013-01-26 00:03:11	supersym	y
2013-01-26 00:03:16	woah	#{name}
2013-01-26 00:03:19	woah	screws up jade
2013-01-26 00:03:32	woah	checking the jade docs now, but i thought id mention it
2013-01-26 00:03:36	woah	if youve ever done that
2013-01-26 00:03:44	supersym	pastebin somewhere?
2013-01-26 00:04:23	supersym	you'd want perhaps #{document.name}
2013-01-26 00:04:34	woah	http://pastebin.com/F8j1XQpF
2013-01-26 00:04:34	supersym	which would render jade -> html <- read by jquery?
2013-01-26 00:04:40	supersym	or you wanna read raw jade
2013-01-26 00:05:09	supersym	huh no indent on tr
2013-01-26 00:05:20	supersym	this is a script block with the indent
2013-01-26 00:05:24	woah	its inside of the script tag
2013-01-26 00:05:27	supersym	yeah
2013-01-26 00:05:29	woah	should be
2013-01-26 00:05:34	supersym	so it thinks its javascript
2013-01-26 00:05:52	woah	ahhh
2013-01-26 00:05:55	woah	got it i think
2013-01-26 00:05:56	supersym	=)
2013-01-26 00:06:57	woah	nah didnt work
2013-01-26 00:07:04	woah	i think i need to escape the #{
2013-01-26 00:07:18	supersym	yeah erh
2013-01-26 00:07:20	supersym	good question
2013-01-26 00:07:29	supersym	\#{name}
2013-01-26 00:07:41	supersym	because else jade thinks its id attrib
2013-01-26 00:07:44	supersym	of div element
2013-01-26 00:07:58	supersym	within double quotes its not a problem like
2013-01-26 00:08:06	supersym	p(class="#{name}")
2013-01-26 00:08:46	supersym	or just do p= name
2013-01-26 00:08:55	supersym	that would work
2013-01-26 00:09:30	supersym	since TJ mentions in the Jade docs somewhere the #{stuff} is actually just sugar for people who think that is valid javascript
2013-01-26 00:09:41	supersym	I think it comes from Ruby ERB or something dunno
2013-01-26 00:10:49	woah	yea so the problem is that #{name} is not meant for the serverside jade
2013-01-26 00:10:56	woah	its meant for the clientside jq\
2013-01-26 00:11:05	supersym	that wont work
2013-01-26 00:11:14	woah	so i need to make jade just print it as text until the jq can get it
2013-01-26 00:11:18	supersym	like i mentioned earlier ..
2013-01-26 00:12:02	woah	i may just put it in a eco file, like the layout
2013-01-26 00:12:03	supersym	well if it is 1 time use you can store it as members of a DOM element
2013-01-26 00:12:09	woah	but i do want to get to the bottom of this
2013-01-26 00:12:27	supersym	generate server side stuff...and read out that client side
2013-01-26 00:14:19	supersym	thats the paradigm anyway I think... rendering static html files in docpad is a build-time process
2013-01-26 00:14:29	supersym	its variables, like meta-data collections and what not
2013-01-26 00:14:51	supersym	don't exist anymore when person X visits your HTML documents and the JS libraries do their work
2013-01-26 00:16:18	supersym	the solution to bridge these gaps is by say a running instance (like REST API) to serve 'real-time' data or to write data to a file (e.g. html elements, attributes but also .txt file etc) and read that from the browser
2013-01-26 00:16:53	supersym	or write code that uses HTML5 local storage, or cookies
2013-01-26 00:17:31	supersym	but simple matter of fact...your docpad.document.getThis() doesnt exist anymore
2013-01-26 00:18:15	supersym	its easy to forget

2013-01-26 00:51:44	supersym	cause all the {} functions and returns can make me a bit dizzy
2013-01-26 00:51:57	supersym	that I find very readable to the extend that I can use it :)

2013-01-26 00:57:56	supersym	oh same here with yield!!

2013-01-26 01:02:24	supersym	still thats the amount of constructs you need before you can properly handle asynchronous callbacks and promises in JS
2013-01-26 01:02:28	supersym	properly
2013-01-26 01:02:39	supersym	that just doesnt seem right anymore does it?

2013-01-26 01:49:25	mikeumus	still learning coffeescript, it's saying over isn't defined in my function: overIt(over, bub) - http://jsfiddle.net/EzZXB/
2013-01-26 02:04:14	mikeumus	actaully for now, no worries I'm just going to use bootstrap tooltips
2013-01-26 02:04:37	mikeumus	for some reason the YUI tooltips are rather involved.
2013-01-26 02:06:09	supersym	overIt =
2013-01-26 02:06:44	supersym	you'll need a variable identifier before you refer to it
2013-01-26 02:06:54	supersym	overIt = (over, bub) ->
2013-01-26 02:07:32	supersym	then you can do overIt("arg1","arg2") or overIt "a", "b"
2013-01-26 02:07:56	supersym	because it is implicit that coffeescript expects a method/function name the arguments follow
2013-01-26 02:09:00	supersym	or when you chain stuff like methodA("1","2").on "error", "stuff"
2013-01-26 02:09:18	supersym	use " or ' or numeric as applicable :P
2013-01-26 02:09:50	supersym	cs REPL is your friend 
2013-01-26 02:10:19	supersym	btw .. atm I am having fun with the JavaScript arguments object
2013-01-26 02:10:38	supersym	see i'm a real js n00b ^^
2013-01-26 02:38:55	mikeumus	no ones is omniscient thankfully, so no worries 
2013-01-26 02:39:13	mikeumus	I can't get this modal to show itself: http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/javascript.html#modals
2013-01-26 02:39:32	mikeumus	I've even pasted the exact example into m index.html
2013-01-26 02:40:36	mikeumus	ohh it's a bootstrap plugin it seems
2013-01-26 02:45:11	mikeumus	well from what I
2013-01-26 02:45:17	mikeumus	I'm reading it should still work
2013-01-26 02:48:52	mikeumus	ohh maybe missing: bootstrap-modal.js
2013-01-26 02:55:05	mikeumus	or bootstrap-modal.js is now just bootstrap.js but bootstrap.js needs to be loaded into the layout
2013-01-26 02:57:31	mikeumus	hey balupton, you may want to consider including bootstrap.min.js in the getBlock('scripts') in default layout for the bootstrap skeleton
2013-01-26 02:57:37	mikeumus	just 2 cents
2013-01-26 02:58:10	balupton	good idea, want to do a pull request?
2013-01-26 02:58:14	mikeumus	otherwise you can't use the bootstrap js by default
2013-01-26 02:58:40	mikeumus	umm... lol, never done one before to reveal my own noobness even further
2013-01-26 02:58:47	mikeumus	I can sure it it a shot
2013-01-26 02:59:02	mikeumus	give it*
2013-01-26 02:59:19	balupton	:) awesome
2013-01-26 02:59:50	mikeumus	8)
2013-01-26 03:15:32	mikeumus	also we have modernizer in the default getBlock('script'), it's not required by bootstrap from what I see, log.js isn't either but these are just niceties I assume. https://github.com/docpad/twitter-bootstrap.docpad/blob/master/src/layouts/default.html.eco
2013-01-26 03:16:09	mikeumus	I don't know if docpad uses log.js or modernizer
2013-01-26 03:18:36	ashnur	nope
2013-01-26 03:18:38	mikeumus	if not then there's the light-weight node.js philosophy argument that maybe these should be lest out of the skeleton? but ... which raises another question, If I removed them from default in my pull req, are you able to partial merges? I only saw the big green merge button in Github's example which doesn't look like it.
2013-01-26 03:18:49	ashnur	the skeleton might use it
2013-01-26 03:19:23	mikeumus	from my working with it I don't think I've seen any uses of it yetthe last two days but I don't know what modernizer looks like but I haven't seen anything out of the nomral
2013-01-26 03:19:44	ashnur	mikeumus: you don't know how git works? :)
2013-01-26 03:20:14	mikeumus	I've used git in a small team on only a few projects, never done a pull request though
2013-01-26 03:20:29	mikeumus	we use Assembla to do merge reqs
2013-01-26 03:20:39	ashnur	I don't know Assembla. 
2013-01-26 03:20:41	mikeumus	and it's uaully not me, casue I'm a noob 
2013-01-26 03:20:48	mikeumus	usually*
2013-01-26 03:21:39	mikeumus	so then no partial merges?
2013-01-26 03:21:54	mikeumus	or customer merges or whatever it may be called if it exists
2013-01-26 03:22:30	mikeumus	Assembla is dev project management tool: https://www.assembla.com/home
2013-01-26 03:23:27	mikeumus	ok well I'm going to rid log.js and modernizer and see how it goes.

2013-01-27 15:08:27	supersym	ah finally i find some hidden gems diagram parser, document generator, 'smart' tracing error results
2013-01-27 15:08:55	supersym	stupid I never found those when I was searching for 2, maybe 3 weeks before ><

2013-01-27 15:20:28	supersym	hey @balupton schema definition for cson would be nice btw ;) as I'm automating a tool for easily composing logical blocks of 'package definition' files like package.json, Cakefiles etc
2013-01-27 15:21:07	supersym	I just write package.cson nowadays anyway... shame it also persists on the .cson extension
2013-01-27 15:21:25	supersym	I guess I could easily hack that away tho :P
2013-01-27 15:22:43	supersym	I guess I should also checkout buildr

2013-01-27 16:55:55	supersym	http://pogoscript.org looks like fun 
2013-01-27 16:56:14	supersym	not just yet natural language and logic but it goes a long way
2013-01-27 16:56:42	supersym	and it would make for a lot nicer parsing in node-natural 
2013-01-27 16:57:19	supersym	if you'd use that as a code analysis tool, it could also, when programming this way, tell you much about the intent
2013-01-27 17:14:26	supersym	then again, its just variable naming conventions
2013-01-27 17:15:05	supersym	camelCase or variable names with spaces == variableNamesWithSpaces
2013-01-27 17:16:17	supersym	but spaces are better at bridging the gap between normal ppl and computers... which dont have to explicitly ask for "insert new task" or "create procedure identifier" related questions
2013-01-27 17:17:22	supersym	if you consider it the statements to be statements, the questions to be queries, (seen a lang or two working that way)
2013-01-27 17:24:13	ashnur	something is not right
2013-01-27 17:24:42	ashnur	while changing templates, partials, documents, I often get to Page Not found
2013-01-27 17:24:58	ashnur	which can be resolved by restarting docpad
2013-01-27 17:25:10	ashnur	must debug it somehow, but I don't know how
2013-01-27 17:28:03	balupton	ashnur: docpad-debug + node-inspector
2013-01-27 17:28:22	ashnur	ok
2013-01-27 17:28:31	ashnur	thanks
2013-01-27 17:28:45	ashnur	maybe I should've known this already :-S
2013-01-27 17:30:54	supersym	hey balupton... you getting your head wrapped around the plugin architecture a bit?
2013-01-27 17:31:17	balupton	supersym: ?
2013-01-27 17:31:27	balupton	ashnur: it's not documented yet, docs need to be updated for it
2013-01-27 17:32:48	supersym	i noticed the stub for something called plugin-engine\
2013-01-27 17:34:06	supersym	and since you fired up the discussion in the issues topics
2013-01-27 17:34:32	supersym	i was just wondering, I tried to look into more detail how plugins hook to docpad now
2013-01-27 17:34:44	supersym	but i notice many plugins taking different approaches
2013-01-27 17:36:51	supersym	(much like you can see you learn and change stuff you did in ealier vs later docpad.coffee/cson files / plugins)
2013-01-27 17:38:28	supersym	but i guess i was just wondering like if you had list of features/compat it would need to have?
2013-01-27 17:39:19	supersym	maybe I have a little problem seeing the "engine" in plugin as in being compatible with stuff out of the box
2013-01-27 17:39:33	supersym	unless you do some form of inspection of stuff being fed
2013-01-27 17:39:59	supersym	and have a machine based logical portion / or manually include/accept/hook stuff into a framework the old way
2013-01-27 17:40:39	supersym	as its impossible to know any future design choices any 3rd parties make
2013-01-27 17:40:53	supersym	its hard to say and predict anything on that field
2013-01-27 17:41:24	supersym	besides doing reflection/scanning/probing when the times come your API is being called by some other program
2013-01-27 17:42:02	supersym	or define of course, the standard on your own side, and expect others to conform to it
2013-01-27 17:42:27	supersym	standards or better said lack thereof always been the major pain in these things :P
2013-01-27 17:43:06	supersym	REST really isnt standard either but its something we can atleast work with for a great deal in modern web :)
2013-01-27 17:46:45	balupton	supersym: yeah, I'm looking into things like that - the main goal would be to be able to turn docpad-only things into more generic everything friendly things
2013-01-27 17:46:50	balupton	however, that is a hard road to go down
2013-01-27 17:46:58	supersym	hell yeah
2013-01-27 17:47:05	supersym	i have been pondering it for weeks
2013-01-27 17:47:07	balupton	because as soon as you start abstracting stuff out, that stuff loses context of the original use case
2013-01-27 17:47:09	supersym	giving me a head acho too
2013-01-27 17:47:16	supersym	ache..even
2013-01-27 17:47:25	balupton	and the bevry workflow is to get stuff done
2013-01-27 17:47:38	supersym	right
2013-01-27 17:47:59	balupton	;)
2013-01-27 17:48:16	balupton	but it's cool to learn your thoughts on this
2013-01-27 17:48:47	supersym	well yea and that says a lot too ... for me, bacause if you'd say "we want to evolve docpad into a selfsustaining community" as a top priority for example
2013-01-27 17:49:15	supersym	it would much easier justify a cloud instance REST API maintained by Bevry
2013-01-27 17:49:36	supersym	it the status quo is "it would break too much"
2013-01-27 17:49:42	supersym	thats good enough for me as well :)
2013-01-27 17:49:54	balupton	it can break whatever
2013-01-27 17:50:10	balupton	but the question is, is it justified - is the value validated
2013-01-27 17:50:13	supersym	you dont have many times you can make those choices usually tho, the more ppl depend upon it the harder it gets to kill it
2013-01-27 17:50:19	balupton	and is it better than the current direction
2013-01-27 17:50:41	supersym	yeah not like its undoable rewriting many of the current plugins...in worst case
2013-01-27 17:51:25	supersym	since usually it would just involve some different functions perhaps that get called, a more standardized libary of function names/objects
2013-01-27 17:52:51	supersym	ideally you'd incrementally implement additional features through inheritence with flexible constraints on the properties it expects
2013-01-27 17:53:23	balupton	--- for building a self-sustaining community - the plan of attack for that is to empower developers - giving them more of what they need to create awesome things - e.g. debug docs, more advanced guides, video tutorials, more advanced plugins - what others are doing doesn't really affect docpad, nor should it, as we have something awesome here and it hits its
2013-01-27 17:53:23	balupton	use cases best
2013-01-27 17:53:47	supersym	imho it boils down to stuff "needs to always be maintained" but you have a choice on how to organize that all
2013-01-27 17:54:15	supersym	if a community does all the work on skeletons, plugins etc and begs for features in the core framework... 
2013-01-27 17:54:15	balupton	"needs to always be maintained" - how do you mean?
2013-01-27 17:54:43	supersym	I mean the code...
2013-01-27 17:55:00	balupton	ahhh, so you see a modular core as the solution to maintainability?
2013-01-27 17:55:04	supersym	usually its not a 1-time deal as we all know :)
2013-01-27 17:55:31	balupton	as if everything is tiny modules, people can fork, and plugin in their own?
2013-01-27 17:56:11	supersym	yeah I feel a more Domain Driven approach might be good at certain points but thats just the top 'school of thought' that I love
2013-01-27 17:56:36	supersym	ideally... docpad would be a center knot, a junction
2013-01-27 17:56:36	balupton	it's hard, because such an approach also battles with fragmentation - for right now, I think the solution is providing better developer docs, guides, pull request process, and bringing on more core contributors
2013-01-27 17:57:06	supersym	but its hard to define the borders on 'modular' aspects of the core in that sense
2013-01-27 17:57:17	balupton	"a center knot, a junction" - like big and flatiron?
2013-01-27 17:57:18	supersym	since all would inherit from BaseEntity super-types
2013-01-27 17:58:12	supersym	if you as my opinion,... I think docpad can manage just fine as it is now on the core aspect
2013-01-27 17:58:46	supersym	docpad also 'just works' so most people wouldnt give a damn about your core being well maintainable in terms of code readability or commenting
2013-01-27 17:59:11	balupton	lets migrate this discussion here - https://docs.google.com/document/d/1REkHMyKtxQ3qsvJVej5bxyjMHrwrHmHxv4u8XWDiELQ/edit
2013-01-27 17:59:12	supersym	and if you dont have much ideas on how you would want to expand the core, if you might even want that
2013-01-27 17:59:21	balupton	that way we can reference it later
2013-01-27 17:59:26	supersym	yea...
2013-01-27 18:00:40	supersym	ooh thats fun :)
2013-01-27 18:01:38	supersym	got any thread where community or yourself have expressed wishes on functionality / longer term goal>??
2013-01-27 18:01:52	supersym	if you could post these for me i'd be very grateful
2013-01-27 18:13:45	balupton	seems the connection is quite poor

2013-01-27 18:52:02	mikeumus	from the search " is coffeescript optional" looks like the coffeescript syntax is optional and you can still have full/normal javascript syntax in .coffee files?
2013-01-27 18:54:15	balupton	mikeumus: yes, two ways - 1. just do my-plugin/lib/my-plugin.plugin.js and code it in javascript then update your package.json to reflect that. 2. use the backtick character in your coffeescript file to run javascript
2013-01-27 18:54:41	balupton	supersym: time for me to head to bed, will review that document in the morning :)
2013-01-27 19:03:36	mikeumus	thanks again balupton

2013-01-27 20:09:04	mikeumus	ok
2013-01-27 21:07:21	mikeumus	what might be an api event(http://docpad.org/docs/events) that I can use to see if someone is using a certain style class to then inject the matching .css file for that class?

2013-01-27 22:01:46	supersym	@ashnur I was out to diner with the mss
2013-01-27 22:04:53	smiffn	how would i render the doc.content from a getCollection('posts').toJSON() to markdown?
2013-01-27 22:08:02	ashnur	smiffn: that really sounds strange
2013-01-27 22:08:46	supersym	# The contents of the file, stored as a String
2013-01-27 22:08:46	supersym	  content: null
2013-01-27 22:09:19	supersym	content is property of file model, document is a file
2013-01-27 22:09:31	supersym	posts are documents
2013-01-27 22:09:57	supersym	hench you have access to the contents...actually you already use it probably in layout
2013-01-27 22:10:39	supersym	cant you do like document.getCollection('posts')[i].content
2013-01-27 22:10:53	smiffn	ashnur: i'm looping through blog posts and printing the date (doc.date), and a link (doc.url). when i print the content it's not rendered as markdown, just plaintext
2013-01-27 22:11:03	supersym	Jade?
2013-01-27 22:11:10	smiffn	yes in in jade
2013-01-27 22:11:17	supersym	use !=
2013-01-27 22:11:21	supersym	not -
2013-01-27 22:11:27	supersym	or =
2013-01-27 22:11:36	smiffn	i'm using div!= doc.content
2013-01-27 22:11:45	supersym	i dunno,..one of them parses the raw html/content
2013-01-27 22:11:55	supersym	but are you sure it isnt rendered already then?
2013-01-27 22:12:27	smiffn	rendered as markdown? nope, i see stars instead of bold like  **hi**

2013-01-27 22:12:38	supersym	ah ok
2013-01-27 22:12:45	supersym	well get html first
2013-01-27 22:13:01	supersym	filename.html.md
2013-01-27 22:13:09	supersym	not just file.md i think
2013-01-27 22:13:33	supersym	that'll render it before you try and use it somewhere else i think
2013-01-27 22:13:48	supersym	damn i dont know enough details about rendering sequences in total
2013-01-27 22:14:00	smiffn	ya i have hello.html.md
2013-01-27 22:15:12	smiffn	thanks for looking into it… i wasn't sure if the intended functionality was to render the markdown in doc.content without calling marked manually
2013-01-27 22:15:56	supersym	its not like a coffee file that it becomes html without doing the name convention
2013-01-27 22:16:12	supersym	but i can have a look if you want
2013-01-27 22:16:18	supersym	the source is your friend
2013-01-27 22:16:55	supersym	if inExtension in ['md','markdown'] and outExtension in [null,'html']
2013-01-27 22:17:44	supersym	then it requires (imports the module) and renders the content

2013-01-27 22:30:36	smiffn	anything obviously wrong with this: http://pastebin.com/AUVP3JAC
2013-01-27 22:30:43	smiffn	my only issue is that the md is rendered
2013-01-27 22:33:32	supersym	let me clone a skel quick
2013-01-27 22:36:38	smiffn	cool thanks :)
2013-01-27 22:46:31	supersym	https://github.com/bevry/docpad/issues/378
2013-01-27 22:46:35	supersym	thats what i thought
2013-01-27 22:46:58	supersym	the thing is, you don't really know who is first?
2013-01-27 22:47:08	supersym	in the whole asynchronous rendering process
2013-01-27 22:47:19	mikeumus	does docpad use jquery? I know that docpad uses backbone/underscore which use jquery but outside of that does docpad use jquery do you know?
2013-01-27 22:47:29	supersym	it doesnt depend on it
2013-01-27 22:47:43	supersym	but some skeletons have a script block with jquery in their layout files
2013-01-27 22:48:01	mikeumus	I'm pondering a fork that uses YUI.app in-place of backbone/ underscore and jquery
2013-01-27 22:48:03	supersym	e.g. client-browser side library implementation (is there any server jquery?)
2013-01-27 22:48:19	mikeumus	yeah like the bootstrap skeleton, which again needs juqery for the backbone
2013-01-27 22:48:20	smiffn	supersym: not sure i understand how the issue relates to the markdown rendering
2013-01-27 22:48:22	supersym	oh u should if you wanna add
2013-01-27 22:48:32	supersym	to docpad...that would be a nice variety
2013-01-27 22:48:56	supersym	ok smiffn:
2013-01-27 22:49:09	mikeumus	I think so, not to mention YUI's extensability, or make a Y.docpad module, that'd be cool
2013-01-27 22:49:19	supersym	you have 1 jade file like fileA.html.jade and 1 file like fileB.html.md correct?
2013-01-27 22:49:25	smiffn	yes
2013-01-27 22:49:35	supersym	and you do from fileA p!= doc.content
2013-01-27 22:49:45	supersym	where doc is the item in collection
2013-01-27 22:49:46	smiffn	right
2013-01-27 22:50:07	supersym	could be many 'posts' could be one whatever
2013-01-27 22:50:25	supersym	what value do you expect doc.content to return?
2013-01-27 22:50:34	supersym	the file content of fileB.html.md
2013-01-27 22:50:39	supersym	which is markdown
2013-01-27 22:50:44	smiffn	exactly
2013-01-27 22:50:57	supersym	how would it render markdown that is imported inside a .jade file?
2013-01-27 22:51:03	supersym	it doesnt
2013-01-27 22:51:13	supersym	unless you use :markdown (might even actually work lol)
2013-01-27 22:51:31	smiffn	ahh haha, interesting, ill try that
2013-01-27 22:51:35	supersym	so either you render the markdown and then include the rendered html
2013-01-27 22:52:10	supersym	so fileB.html.md would have been rendered before fileA else it cant get the 'html' content
2013-01-27 22:52:15	supersym	either that or
2013-01-27 22:52:17	supersym	last option
2013-01-27 22:53:04	supersym	to include <script> in the head with http://code.google.com/p/pagedown/wiki/PageDown
2013-01-27 22:53:04	smiffn	ok, thanks for the explanation sypersym
2013-01-27 22:53:17	supersym	then you would have client-side browser do the rendering
2013-01-27 22:53:22	supersym	actually what linked in does
2013-01-27 22:53:41	supersym	AJAX stream markdown/jade etc and have the visitor render the views on their machines

2013-01-27 22:54:35	smiffn	is there a way to call the markdown plugin and pass it doc.content from the jade template?
2013-01-27 22:55:02	mikeumus	Mojito delegates stuff to the client like that too, see the "Two Runtimes" part here: http://developer.yahoo.com/cocktails/mojito/docs/intro/mojito_overview.html#why-mojito
2013-01-27 22:55:32	smiffn	thanks supersym, greatly appreciate the info
2013-01-27 22:57:15	supersym	really good question
2013-01-27 22:57:21	supersym	tbh... i dont know
2013-01-27 22:57:39	supersym	in many cases I think the data in between or after rendering isnt stored
2013-01-27 22:57:42	supersym	i think
2013-01-27 22:57:51	supersym	so it knows about the markdown source
2013-01-27 22:57:56	supersym	and it can produce a html file
2013-01-27 22:58:03	supersym	(in the out folder!)
2013-01-27 22:58:11	supersym	and after that docpad is done
2013-01-27 22:58:22	supersym	nothing in between I'd say,...but I could be wrong
2013-01-27 22:58:36	supersym	then I guess you can always render a file specifically
2013-01-27 22:58:51	supersym	or make sure one renders before the other by hooking on to an event
2013-01-27 22:59:08	supersym	or just as part of a general build process in say Cakefile
2013-01-27 22:59:20	supersym	it can really all make sense depending on why you'd want that
2013-01-27 23:00:03	supersym	erh but there is also the getCollection('html')
2013-01-27 23:00:16	supersym	now I'm not sure, but it could be the rendered html results
2013-01-27 23:00:35	supersym	html — for all documents and files and result in a html file
2013-01-27 23:00:42	supersym	that sounds a lot like it
2013-01-27 23:03:06	supersym	hmmm doesnt seem it goes beyond that either
2013-01-27 23:03:45	supersym	as far as I know,...the documents/files have no existence beyond src/... and all they do is 'dump' the output rendered results in out/
2013-01-27 23:04:05	supersym	and thats final...no variables or collections with what files are beyond src/
2013-01-27 23:10:57	supersym	btw... I got markdown2terminal :D
2013-01-27 23:11:11	supersym	README.md in the console with ANSI colors hehe

2013-01-27 23:29:08	mikeumus	markdown2terminal, lol 8p
2013-01-27 23:29:09	mikeumus	that's cool
2013-01-27 23:34:37	supersym	yea... atm im really putting effort in bringing all that crap together a bit more
2013-01-27 23:34:59	mikeumus	that's a cool idea
2013-01-27 23:35:02	supersym	extremely extendible powerpack
2013-01-27 23:35:22	supersym	using variable/hierarchical config.json files
2013-01-27 23:35:31	mikeumus	I'm excited about the yui bootstrap & yui docpad forks 
2013-01-27 23:35:37	supersym	trying to group together the best packages in categories 
2013-01-27 23:35:41	supersym	:D
2013-01-27 23:36:00	mikeumus	and this mozilla persona plugin will make for real nice basic user login/email logging
2013-01-27 23:36:07	supersym	ah yes
2013-01-27 23:36:16	supersym	thats gonna be bigger in the future
2013-01-27 23:36:22	mikeumus	yeah
2013-01-27 23:36:25	supersym	i see it holds some good promise anyway
2013-01-27 23:36:32	mikeumus	this is mostly prototypical
2013-01-27 23:36:33	supersym	and nearly all mozilla is
2013-01-27 23:36:55	mikeumus	i first learned of persona at http://irisnpm.com
2013-01-27 23:37:03	supersym	got tilt for firefox??
2013-01-27 23:37:11	supersym	that is so friggin sweet
2013-01-27 23:37:14	mikeumus	I've seen it yes.
2013-01-27 23:37:17	mikeumus	yeah it is
2013-01-27 23:37:38	supersym	first thing on my wish list tho
2013-01-27 23:37:48	mikeumus	irisNPM is used by nodejitsu and a few others as a enterprise security/trusted/private npm backup
2013-01-27 23:38:01	mikeumus	akin to irisCouch and from the same people
2013-01-27 23:38:19	supersym	I would like to bring together node-natural with coffeescript corpus, docpad (or any) source
2013-01-27 23:38:20	mikeumus	or npm clone*
2013-01-27 23:38:43	mikeumus	node-natural? coffescript corpus?
2013-01-27 23:38:55	supersym	and ask a question in say this IRC channel for the bot to return to me the LOC from github source
2013-01-27 23:39:01	supersym	yes...im that lazy
2013-01-27 23:39:14	mikeumus	LOC ?
2013-01-27 23:39:21	supersym	lines of code
2013-01-27 23:39:35	supersym	https://github.com/NaturalNode/natural
2013-01-27 23:39:37	mikeumus	I see, not lazy, but really useful I'd say
2013-01-27 23:39:41	mikeumus	hum
2013-01-27 23:39:46	supersym	corpus is like what they feed it at 
2013-01-27 23:39:56	supersym	classifier.addDocument('i am long qqqq', 'buy');
2013-01-27 23:39:56	supersym	classifier.addDocument('buy the q''s', 'buy');
2013-01-27 23:40:05	supersym	and then train the classifier
2013-01-27 23:40:22	supersym	so I can do stuff like "I got copper what do I do?"
2013-01-27 23:40:41	supersym	I tried that with CoffeeScript statements
2013-01-27 23:40:59	supersym	"thisAndThat = () ->" and "(next)" stuff
2013-01-27 23:41:30	supersym	and told it "asynchronous callback" or "function" or "recursive loop"
2013-01-27 23:41:36	supersym	stuff like that
2013-01-27 23:41:48	mikeumus	hum
2013-01-27 23:42:22	mikeumus	I've always been a big fan of RDF/OWL and web semantics: http://www.w3schools.com/rdf/default.asp http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Ontology_Language http://schema.org/
2013-01-27 23:42:26	supersym	it was very accurate also because it calculates the list of most probable stuff so nr 2,3 on the list usually was also correct being both a statement, a function and a property for example
2013-01-27 23:42:43	supersym	yeah that kind of stuff facinates me too
2013-01-27 23:42:51	mikeumus	no one really takes advantage of the tech though cause it can be complex, but really powerful too once you get a framework for it 
2013-01-27 23:42:52	supersym	and its very nice that have it all under node.js power house
2013-01-27 23:42:59	supersym	yup
2013-01-27 23:43:01	mikeumus	yeah
2013-01-27 23:43:07	supersym	mashing up shizznits is so easy in node
2013-01-27 23:43:15	supersym	i can make you a smart REPL in a few lines of code
2013-01-27 23:43:29	mikeumus	yeah casue of the small module philosophy 
2013-01-27 23:43:43	supersym	essentially mashup package.json published stuff but nowadays i add in a few .jars too
2013-01-27 23:44:09	supersym	http://code.google.com/p/berkeleyparser/
2013-01-27 23:44:19	supersym	with that parser, I can process any english sentence
2013-01-27 23:44:24	mikeumus	modularity is really popular right now in general from what I can see. Even Syphany 2 for the php framework has "blocks" which are modules like who you use YUI almost
2013-01-27 23:44:33	supersym	and guarantee that what that was question, or an assignment
2013-01-27 23:44:44	supersym	informative (in the past) or tasked (future)
2013-01-27 23:45:07	mikeumus	that's cool
2013-01-27 23:45:17	supersym	http://www.bbn.com/resources/img/ontonotes_view.png
2013-01-27 23:45:24	supersym	that is what is really the top of it tho
2013-01-27 23:45:33	supersym	if you can get that in a cs/js somewhere :)
2013-01-27 23:45:39	supersym	its all context baby
2013-01-27 23:46:01	supersym	node-natural is with wordnet now so easy looking up synonyms etc too
2013-01-27 23:46:14	supersym	hook up some outside kb like wikipedia with require 'YQL'
2013-01-27 23:46:18	supersym	and voila :)
2013-01-27 23:46:28	mikeumus	wow, that's cool and looks powerful
2013-01-27 23:47:13	mikeumus	a semantic web future, it's hard to fathom the possibilities, long tail pin point searches for one thing though
2013-01-27 23:48:18	supersym	With speech = pwnage
2013-01-27 23:48:26	supersym	"Build me a new website"
2013-01-27 23:48:48	supersym	"Do you want a responsive grid?" Yes "How much columns?" and so on
2013-01-27 23:49:28	supersym	not under options 1,2,3 etc but truely dynamic and semi-governed by a control flow on probably values between 0 and 1
2013-01-27 23:50:08	supersym	If the word Apple is given around Mac and OS X it's probably the computer and not the fruit :P
2013-01-27 23:50:44	supersym	ultimately I wish I could program more like that
2013-01-27 23:51:52	supersym	http://pogoscript.org/guide.html#functions
2013-01-27 23:52:16	supersym	is a step in the direction of atleast appearing more natural in terms of spaces and flexible rules
2013-01-28 00:20:36	mikeumus	yup, and pogoscript looks cool
2013-01-28 00:20:56	mikeumus	my friend found a YUI fork for bootstrap.js stuff: http://jshirley.github.com/bootstrap/javascript.html
2013-01-28 00:21:18	mikeumus	which is a good thing, now I just have to do the docpad fork
2013-01-28 00:24:01	supersym	yeah... i found that plugins had quite a few different ways they would interact with docpad
2013-01-28 00:24:09	supersym	but skeletons should be a breeze
2013-01-28 00:27:32	supersym	Imagine a world where you can write JavaScript to control blenders, lights, security systems, or even robots. Yes, I said robots. That world is here and now with node-serialport. It provides a very simple interface to the low level serial port code necessary to program Arduino chipsets, X10 wireless communications, or even the rising Z-Wave and Zigbee standards. The physical world is your oyster with this
2013-01-28 00:27:32	supersym	goodie. For a full break down of why we made this, please read NodeBots - The Rise of JS Robotics.
2013-01-28 00:47:51	nexusIX	hey, been experimenting with DocPad, have a question if anyone's got time
2013-01-28 00:52:00	mikeumus	supersym is good for helping people out if he's around nexusIX 
2013-01-28 00:52:39	nexusIX	cool, saw your chat with him
2013-01-28 00:53:42	mikeumus	yeah  8), does anyone know if sublime text has a code highlighter for .coffee files or do we just use the javascript one?
2013-01-28 00:55:08	mikeumus	look like the javascript highlighter works fine 
2013-01-28 00:56:28	nexusIX	mainly wanted to figure out how best to use browserify in docpad, the docpad site mentions using browserify but I can't find any other references to it
2013-01-28 00:58:42	nexusIX	the grunt boilerplate allows you to set up a static list of javascripts that get concatenated and sent client-side, but I'd prefer to use browserify
2013-01-28 00:59:17	nexusIX	so I can easily have different javascript pulled for different pages

2013-01-28 03:01:14	nexusIX	yes
2013-01-28 03:01:52	nexusIX	did you see the question? if you have any experience with browserify
2013-01-28 03:01:59	mikeumus	there is this listed under the Nifies in the plugins page of docpad.org: https://gist.github.com/4398093
2013-01-28 03:02:06	mikeumus	I don't yet actually
2013-01-28 03:02:10	mikeumus	but
2013-01-28 03:03:33	mikeumus	I remember someone talking about that in this irc it may have been
2013-01-28 03:03:34	nexusIX	ok, this looks like it could be the ticket
2013-01-28 03:03:53	mikeumus	alright, *fingers crossed*
2013-01-28 03:04:26	nexusIX	heh, thanks, I've been working on building my own simple CMS that combined and minifies all JS and CSS for each page
2013-01-28 03:04:58	mikeumus	nice, yeah docpad has many building blocks that you can build off for that
2013-01-28 03:06:04	nexusIX	I was also wondering, if I need to set up an ajax service that gets and returns JSON, is that often done through DocPad or do most DocPac users set up a separate Node application for that?
2013-01-28 03:07:14	nexusIX	This ajax service is not for creating blog posts or anything like that, so its data would not really be relevant to anything published through DocPad

2013-01-28 03:40:50	mikeumus	pardon I was away, umm... let me think...
2013-01-28 03:42:21	nexusIX	I'm looking at building a web app that does a lot of ajax, so I wonder if there is any upside to having the POST processing happen inside DocPad
2013-01-28 03:45:10	mikeumus	docpad uses query-engine at it's core which is a sorting/selecting the json once you've received it: http://docpad.org/docs/template-data , https://github.com/bevry/query-engine
2013-01-28 03:45:58	mikeumus	and there is custom routing here for POST GET type stuff: https://gist.github.com/3695936
2013-01-28 03:46:33	nexusIX	cool, I see
2013-01-28 03:47:16	nexusIX	the templates and query engine seem mostly related to publishing material through DocPad, and it appears that its primary mission is as a publishing tool rather than a web service
2013-01-28 03:47:46	nexusIX	But adding additional custom routes should meet the web service needs as well
2013-01-28 03:50:02	mikeumus	yeah it's really a flexible way to render things, that auto generates to static files and has the ability to become a node.js server or used as a node.js module in a app
2013-01-28 03:50:38	mikeumus	a quick way to get a website online and build it into a web service 
2013-01-28 03:50:50	mikeumus	with other node modules 
2013-01-28 03:51:24	mikeumus	it's not really a full MVC but many of those pieces are there to do it
2013-01-28 03:54:17	nexusIX	thanks for the tips
2013-01-28 03:54:37	mikeumus	not a problem
2013-01-28 03:54:47	mikeumus	glad to do it

2013-01-29 19:45:06	Tybstar	but i'd like to explicitly order the pages, as opposed to just going by the default sort.
2013-01-29 19:45:11	Tybstar	what's the best way to handle that?
2013-01-29 19:45:16	Tybstar	can i hardcode an order in one of my config files, maybe?

2013-01-29 20:07:00	mikeumus_	[2:06:35 PM] Michael Duane Mooring: this looks like a good article here for it: http://www.steveworkman.com/node-js/2012/installing-jsdom-on-windows/
2013-01-29 20:08:28	mikeumus_	yeah I've been telling balupton that my company might start using docpad for our client websites. We've been suing Wordpress. Don't worry though, I'm just doing the initial scouting of docpad I have people I work with who are much more competent than myself. 
2013-01-29 20:09:05	ashnur	you were suing wordpress?
2013-01-29 20:09:07	ashnur	what? :D

2013-01-29 20:09:15	ashnur	phew
2013-01-29 20:10:08	mikeumus_	the wordpress trademark belongs to the wordpress foundation, it'd be mean to sue them. It'd be automattic inc that'd get sued if it did
2013-01-29 20:12:29	mikeumus_	they'd have the cash for the lawsuit: http://gigaom.com/2008/01/22/wordpresscom-creator-raises-29m/

2013-01-29 20:42:05	mikeumus_	so I decided to just use Cloud9 IDE as it has the linux console and python already installed and everything else. docpad-plugin-pygments loads fine in C9 via docpad run, only issue now that how do I set the env.IP? Docpad says it's running at a IP address that is local and C9 can't support obviously:
2013-01-29 20:42:06	mikeumus_	info: DocPad listening to http://127.9.102.129:8080/
2013-01-29 20:42:40	Tybstar	mine says "localhost" but in reality it's listening on 0.0.0.0 :)
2013-01-29 20:42:45	Tybstar	so check netstat -lnp
2013-01-29 20:43:30	ashnur	i would like to raise some money to, like 2-3million would be enough to get started
2013-01-29 20:43:32	ashnur	:P
2013-01-29 20:43:52	ashnur	i would create a game no one has ever seen or conceived :P
2013-01-29 20:44:45	mikeumus_	Hey Tybstar, thanks I'll try that.
2013-01-29 20:45:20	mikeumus_	well you can still do it ashnur, you just do it as a side project, buildl a prototype to use to pitch to investors
2013-01-29 20:45:27	mikeumus_	build*
2013-01-29 20:45:44	ashnur	I am not employed right now

2013-01-29 20:45:51	mikeumus_	ohh
2013-01-29 20:45:56	ashnur	I am working my way towards that
2013-01-29 20:46:16	ashnur	but there is a reason why I am confident it would be an original idea
2013-01-29 20:46:34	ashnur	it's one of those ideas all my friends think I am crazy when I tell them

2013-01-29 21:16:37	mikeumus_	so at the bottom of this page on docpad config, it says that we can set a .env file with things like process.env.IP/PORT ect... I'm new to the .env file. It it like config.env or is just like .gitignore where it doesn't have a label but just .env ?
2013-01-29 21:16:41	mikeumus_	http://docpad.org/docs/config
2013-01-29 21:40:00	mikeumus_	so .env file? 
2013-01-29 21:48:34	mikeumus_	I assume it's just .env so I'll try that
2013-01-29 21:55:17	sergeylukin	I am working my way towards creating simplest game for years already:D Hopefully you will not be lazy like me
2013-01-29 22:03:40	mikeumus_	I have a couple friends that have had games as side projects for years. It just takes constant watering like a plant.
2013-01-29 22:11:13	mikeumus_	ok I figured it out. You don't need .env files or even to set the port anywhere, you just need to use the deploy/run tab in C9 and set the "file path:" to ./node_modules/docpad/bin/docpad-server
2013-01-29 22:11:38	mikeumus_	http://web-mart.mikeumus.c9.io/
2013-01-29 22:12:09	mikeumus_	and in the cmd line output C9 will provide that url. 
2013-01-29 22:12:41	mikeumus_	I think it's worthy to have a note for C9 people somewhere, in a wiki or something
2013-01-29 22:33:08	mikeumus_	hopefully this'll help someone along their docpad path: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14592695/how-do-i-get-docpad-server-running-generating-in-cloud-9-ide/14592696#14592696

2013-01-29 23:01:07	benadam	is it ok/safe run run docpad with 'docpad run' in production?
2013-01-29 23:22:13	mikeumus_	I'd say so. Are you worried tha when docpad generates files it may overwrite stuff?
2013-01-29 23:23:22	mikeumus_	So I can't replicate and get a new docpad instance running on C9. Tried everything except the .env file which I'll be trying now, fingers crossed* It could be C9 too as it's it's pretty unstable imo
2013-01-29 23:25:19	mikeumus_	nope, can't get it working now
2013-01-29 23:27:46	benadam	mikeumus_: I was more concerned about stability, and overall best practices. Most of my site is static but it seems I'll need to the server so I can send emails with node mailer.
2013-01-29 23:28:42	mikeumus_	if those are the parameters then I'd say it's plenty fine to use "docpad run"

2013-01-29 23:35:10	mikeumus_	I'm not sure the best tool for that. I've never had a docpad node server stop on me yet though.

2013-01-29 23:35:26	benadam	good to hear :)
2013-01-29 23:42:55	mikeumus_	yeah  8)
2013-01-29 23:43:33	mikeumus_	but docpad is pretty open so if you want to use forever with it, your free/able to do so easily enough. 
2013-01-29 23:50:34	mikeumus_	oh man I have to abandon the C9 ship again, it's just not working. I did all these changes and then reloaded the project from the dashboard and all the changes were gone! Classic C9. If the C9 dev's used C9 to build C9, it probably wouldn't be so buggy, 8p
2013-01-29 23:51:02	mikeumus_	but they obviously don't

2013-01-30 09:03:10	ashnur	what is the advantage to deploying to anywhere?
2013-01-30 09:07:51	RickCogley	versus, "static" files, copied via, say, rsync to a server via sftp. Is a server that is specifically set up for node.js going to give an advantage? 
2013-01-30 09:09:36	RickCogley	specifically, I am reading this doc - http://docpad.org/docs/deploy - and trying to figure out what a node.js service gets me, besides probably regular upgrades I guess? 
2013-01-30 09:15:17	ashnur	RickCogley: you can run javascript.
2013-01-30 09:16:22	ashnur	even if you have a static site, you have to serve them somehow. you might use nginx, apache or docpad-server which runs on node.js

2013-01-30 21:19:05	mcecot	hi there. i'm new to docpad and i have some brain barrier regarding the question where to place stylus or less files which are meant to be included and not to be rendered. when i have a.css.less containing @import "b.less"; it will compile correctly and i find a.css in my out folder but additionally there  is b.less in my out folder, too.
2013-01-30 21:20:22	mcecot	how do you solve this problem? clean up after compilation? using some regexp voodoo in ignorePaths or ignoreCustomPatterns?

2013-01-30 21:49:50	ashnur	i am not sure
2013-01-30 21:50:41	mcecot	by saying include i mean @import "ab.less";

2013-02-02 20:47:02	ashnur	hey
2013-02-02 20:47:35	ashnur	zenorocha: why the array notation there_
2013-02-02 20:47:39	ashnur	?
2013-02-02 20:50:21	khrome83	so when it try to call split on value in coffeescript tells me undefined...
2013-02-02 20:50:28	khrome83	but when i do typeof value
2013-02-02 20:50:31	khrome83	tells me string
2013-02-02 20:50:40	khrome83	when i output value, returns the string
2013-02-02 20:53:59	zenorocha	what array notation?
2013-02-02 20:58:56	ashnur	[] ← array , {} ← object
2013-02-02 20:59:16	ashnur	i don't think it's relevant, but it might be 
2013-02-02 20:59:24	ashnur	not sure how coffeescript deals with this
2013-02-02 21:03:54	supersym	implicit and explicit
2013-02-02 21:04:14	supersym	got a codebin?
2013-02-02 21:04:27	khrome83	this is really frustrating, anyone have the answer to my issue above? this is making no sense to me...
2013-02-02 21:04:43	supersym	pls do a pastebin

2013-02-02 21:07:40	khrome83	i know how to split the string
2013-02-02 21:07:44	khrome83	but that is my issue
2013-02-02 21:08:08	khrome83	the paste didnt include the string params to split by, but i can't do anything against the string, but it says its a string according to typeof
2013-02-02 21:08:25	khrome83	docpad fails to generate with this error
2013-02-02 21:12:34	supersym	right
2013-02-02 21:13:05	supersym	i have no clue if you can do it like this 
2013-02-02 21:13:12	khrome83	any ideas?
2013-02-02 21:13:16	supersym	let me test it a bit
2013-02-02 21:13:34	khrome83	hmm, i mean its basic javascript
2013-02-02 21:13:40	supersym	not that
2013-02-02 21:13:54	supersym	it might just be the docpad instance values
2013-02-02 21:14:00	khrome83	why is something that is a string, not a string, i feel like this is a quirk in CoffeeScript
2013-02-02 21:14:00	supersym	tried adding .toJSON()?
2013-02-02 21:14:06	khrome83	yeah
2013-02-02 21:14:43	khrome83	can do toJSON of null
2013-02-02 21:14:50	supersym	getFile?
2013-02-02 21:14:53	khrome83	yet i can do JSON.stringify() and output the result
2013-02-02 21:14:55	khrome83	yeah
2013-02-02 21:14:55	supersym	can files have titles>?
2013-02-02 21:15:08	khrome83	its meta data
2013-02-02 21:15:13	khrome83	its queries the file fine
2013-02-02 21:15:14	supersym	documents yea
2013-02-02 21:15:20	supersym	url? name?
2013-02-02 21:15:38	khrome83	it finds the file, i can output ALL the contents
2013-02-02 21:16:02	supersym	ok
2013-02-02 21:16:10	khrome83	i want to split the concents by the first paragraph and it wont let me use any JS functions agaisnt the object thazt contentRenderedWithoutLayouts returns
2013-02-02 21:16:12	khrome83	its strange
2013-02-02 21:16:14	supersym	so the file is a document?

2013-02-02 21:20:20	supersym	javascript has it too
2013-02-02 21:20:23	supersym	Jade anyway
2013-02-02 21:22:38	supersym	weird
2013-02-02 21:25:05	khrome83	so i am not crazy?
2013-02-02 21:26:07	supersym	well yes/no
2013-02-02 21:26:37	supersym	i think its that you try to perform this regular javascript string method
2013-02-02 21:26:48	supersym	but assume we're dealing with a string
2013-02-02 21:26:53	supersym	atleast thats what it tells us
2013-02-02 21:26:58	khrome83	yeah
2013-02-02 21:27:00	supersym	but when...
2013-02-02 21:27:23	supersym	i usually end up defining this stuff in a helper function
2013-02-02 21:29:30	khrome83	this is in a helper function inside the docpad.coffee
2013-02-02 21:29:49	supersym	:S
2013-02-02 21:32:18	supersym	see this does work 
2013-02-02 21:32:32	supersym	in jade
2013-02-02 21:32:40	supersym	- var x = "a simple test"
2013-02-02 21:32:48	supersym	p= x.split(" ");
2013-02-02 21:32:53	supersym	works find
2013-02-02 21:33:11	supersym	- x = docpad.....  and it fails
2013-02-02 21:33:36	khrome83	strange
2013-02-02 21:37:45	khrome83	ok
2013-02-02 21:39:27	khrome83	i figured out the problem
2013-02-02 21:39:45	khrome83	if i console.log to the cmd line, it would show x as null sometimes, alwasy the first time
2013-02-02 21:39:53	khrome83	i guess maybe its a side effect of how the getFile works

2013-02-03 15:44:34	balupton	e.g. a references b, that is fine, we can do that with one pass

2013-02-04 19:38:10	supersym	you could dynamic write any document..file from your server, easiest would be 1 language so node.js for server side writing/manipulation of files
2013-02-04 19:38:39	supersym	but what meta do you mean? html meta-data or docpad document meta-data
2013-02-04 19:39:45	supersym	also you could have docpad running instance and have apache serve up out/ directory as static
2013-02-04 19:40:09	supersym	hmm i should really check for partures :P

2013-02-07 04:04:30	mikeumus	Hey Gang, so one thing I haven't been able to get woring with docpad yet is whenever I create a .eco or .anything file, it doesn't count the .eco part. I have a index.html.eco with a <%- getBlock %> and it's giving me the warning on docpad run: warning:   Rendering the extension "css" to "mobile" on "styles\render.mobile.css" didn't  do anything.   Explanation here: http://docpad.org/extension-not-rendering
2013-02-07 04:28:28	ashnur	balupton: when I am writing a plugin in a project with many sourcefiles, is it possible somehow to reload the plugin without reloading the documents? it's only ~20 seconds with 171 files but still, it bugs me :)
2013-02-07 04:29:10	ashnur	mikeumus: yeah, that is because you have it in the documents directory, i guess
2013-02-07 04:29:44	mikeumus	thanks for the info, how can I do .eco pages then? They are always layouts?
2013-02-07 04:30:00	ashnur	the eco is unrelated to that error, the error says .css
2013-02-07 04:30:29	ashnur	if you have something.html.eco in the documents and the eco plugin installed, it should work

2013-02-07 05:16:46	ashnur	or if it has only html
2013-02-07 05:17:08	mikeumus	yeah <%- @getBlock... %>
2013-02-07 05:17:23	mikeumus	and the plugin for eco is installed successfully.

2013-02-07 12:11:06	ashnur	balupton: this gui thing would be very easy to solve with plugins too if there were API for Users Management & Content Management with authentication
2013-02-07 12:11:48	ashnur	balupton: even if not as core features but using third party services, if these would be present as examples, it would help many people
2013-02-07 12:12:39	ashnur	and I had the idea that both of these would be easier to solve if docpad had the ability to work with a database and not have to parse everything every time
2013-02-07 12:13:05	ashnur	I am going to finish this wordpress thing very soon 
2013-02-07 12:13:18	ashnur	and I am going to need this database thing personally
2013-02-07 12:13:38	ashnur	because otherwise the page will become very slow very fast
2013-02-07 12:13:47	ashnur	so I guess I will work on this no matter what 
2013-02-07 12:14:57	ashnur	another option would be to use an already database dependent framework, maybe that is less work than adding these features to docpad

2013-02-07 14:39:21	supersym	be sure to read whats actually *lacking* in Meteor etc., where flatiron excells (I'm sure balupton has tho, since he mentioned flatiron being incompatible with docpad atm - flatiron works only with flatiron I think tho)
2013-02-07 14:40:25	supersym	if you can master this sh!t (client-server side sync of RT data models) you have GUI in the pocket... and are node cloud end-boss
2013-02-07 14:40:41	supersym	you could setup a hosting service and make big $$$ :P
2013-02-07 14:41:02	supersym	key is also how docpad distributes the workload
2013-02-07 14:41:43	supersym	i guess you'll have to base that API on a well-defined messaging framework/system of your own
2013-02-07 14:41:54	supersym	e.g. evented
2013-02-07 14:42:43	supersym	im not sure how you would tie up multiple docpad instances and workers on the inter and intra-communication process level
2013-02-07 14:43:31	supersym	being able to spawn 1 docpad cluster over any PaaS and govern from browser GUI while serving up static/dynamic content for both admin as visitor/user is some of the elemental mechanics that need to be defined in the design
2013-02-07 14:43:54	supersym	distributing some (heavy) workload to the client might be needed
2013-02-07 14:45:04	supersym	i imagine a central/master docpad for that, being able to use slaves, that are able to spawn workers e.g. the server, renderer, messanger
2013-02-07 14:46:26	ashnur	supersym: you write so much I am sure balupton will never scroll back to read what I wrote
2013-02-07 14:47:16	supersym	then you can make it so that you login to your site control panel (which is a docpad admin served up by itself) change a docpad setting in a browser contenteditable field / DOM elements generated from docpad.cson ~> rerenderer logic ~> balancer kicks in to use local machine for heavy process ~> return to the server ~> serve static files 
2013-02-07 14:47:28	ashnur	you should really blog or something, and try to be a bit more concise here. Maybe I am a terrible person, but I just don't have the power of will to try and read and understand  this much

2013-02-26 01:57:49	soapdog	Hi Folks! I am having a newbie problem. I am trying to deploy to a non-root folder and all my CSS and JS includes from the template are failing. I tried setting my URL on docpad.coffee but it doesn't help.
2013-02-26 02:31:31	supersym	hey ... what do you mean by non-root folder and 'failing' ? :)
2013-02-26 02:32:05	supersym	btw check what your $PWD is and that you are at the root of the .git/docpad project before you hit generate/run :P
2013-02-26 02:32:20	supersym	i have that sometimes too that Im in src/ or lib/ and try to execute docpad run
2013-02-26 02:32:46	supersym	as it will only and only then work inside the root path (where probably docpad.coffee is)
2013-02-26 02:40:23	soapdog	supersym: thanks for the reply. What I mean is that in my local machine, everything works fine. When I deploy the static site to Apache in a non-root folder such as /clients/myclient all the includes fail because they are absolute such as /vendor when it should resolve to /clients/myclient/vendor.

2013-02-26 04:06:00	chadananda	I'm messing around with docpad on the mac. "docpad run" seems to only work with sudo, otherwise I get all kinds of npm errors. Am I doing it right?
2013-02-26 04:17:13	chadananda	If I do use sudo, the process works but in finder I do not have access to the 'out' directory without changing permissions.
2013-02-26 04:39:44	soapdog	chadananda: try changing the permissions of your .npm folder in your home ~/ folder. It may be set to root instead of your user.
2013-02-26 04:40:03	soapdog	chadananda: also check if your apps folder belongs to your user or root.
2013-02-26 04:45:44	chadananda	that worked! ~/.npm did not have my user access. I must have install npm with sudo
2013-02-26 04:47:04	soapdog	chadananda: I did the same thing... :-P

2013-02-26 06:11:25	supersym	mgroves: you should really install node.js without sudo permissions
2013-02-26 06:11:45	supersym	its gonna save u a lot of pain and security issues
2013-02-26 06:12:02	supersym	how? try this oneliner: 
2013-02-26 06:14:13	supersym	test -d "/usr/local/src" || sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/src; sudo chown -R $USER /usr/local && cd /usr/local/src && git clone https://github.com/joyent/node && cd node
2013-02-26 06:15:32	supersym	next you will need to pick a version of node.js using `git checkout v0.8.20`
2013-02-26 06:16:20	supersym	last step is to properly point the GCC configuration to use the alternative directory we do own (as we do not want to chown /usr/bin e.g) and do it like
2013-02-26 06:16:42	supersym	./configure --prefix="/usr/local" && make && make install
2013-02-26 06:17:13	supersym	as you see, you don't even need 'sudo' to do 'make install' because we told the compiler to use prefixes for our location
2013-02-26 06:17:37	supersym	and since we own that prefixed location, no problems installing now and in the future you can just do
2013-02-26 06:17:47	supersym	npm i -g marked ... no sudo :)
2013-02-26 06:18:44	supersym	also keep in mind, sometimes you may need to point the correct environment variables $NODE_DIR and $NODE_PATH and some programs that use native bindings (node-gyp) may require you to try out the following
2013-02-26 06:18:59	supersym	e.g. 'npm i -g strider' gives errors -> try this
2013-02-26 06:19:13	supersym	npm i -g strider --nodedir="/usr/local/src/node"
2013-02-26 06:19:41	supersym	this helps out any confused node.js installs that think it should be elsewhere... 
2013-02-26 06:19:57	supersym	final steps is to symlink for which you do need sudo if you want to do
2013-02-26 06:20:09	supersym	sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/node /usr/bin
2013-02-26 06:20:16	supersym	sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/npm /usr/bin
2013-02-26 06:20:35	supersym	sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/coffee /usr/bin
2013-02-26 06:20:39	supersym	etc
2013-02-26 06:22:07	supersym	ofc ensure first that node is properly removed, any binaries that you used to install through your package manager... you dont want to be behind to start with, we'll compile our own software and a small program like node.js won't take longer than 5 minutes on most machines
2013-02-26 06:30:03	supersym	last but not least, I tend to add "node_modules/.bin" to my PATH so I can directly use any binaries that are automatically placed in the node_modules .bin directory
2013-02-26 06:30:42	supersym	so that instead of what happens now doing "docpad run" it most probably uses the globally installed docpad - which is ok usually
2013-02-26 06:31:31	supersym	but when debugging issues on the level of dependency management and trying to pin down where stuff broke, you might just want to do a "npm i docpad" (so no global) inside the root so that our PATH may find it at ".bin" 
2013-02-26 06:31:54	supersym	but you must make sure that this comes before anything else in the path, or it won't use these executables so:
2013-02-26 06:32:32	supersym	export PATH="node_modules/.bin:${PATH}" inside ~/.bashrc should be good
2013-02-26 06:33:29	supersym	this will ensure that if there are multiple docpad files, those locally will come first and doing "docpad run" will actually do "node_modules/.bin/docpad run" instead

2013-02-27 04:21:31	Tybstar	every time, huh?
2013-02-27 04:21:31	steventrevathan	happened once I hooked up an imagemagick process to it

2013-02-27 20:15:58	PlaygroundInc	Hmm, I think i've figured it out. Was getting a complete overload of EMFILE errors after upgrading both node and docpad to the latest. 
2013-02-27 20:16:07	steventrevathan	ha!
2013-02-27 20:16:13	steventrevathan	that's exactly the error I'm currently having
2013-02-27 20:16:19	steventrevathan	maybe you can tell me how you solved it :)
2013-02-27 20:16:23	PlaygroundInc	Bumping up the ulimit helped with a tempfix.
2013-02-27 20:16:41	steventrevathan	you bumped the ulimit on the shell running docpad?
2013-02-27 20:16:45	PlaygroundInc	Try this and tell me what happens:

2013-02-27 20:17:14	PlaygroundInc	What emfile error were you getting, and when? It seems like a common problem.
2013-02-27 20:18:27	steventrevathan	OK, I'm running on osx but I've done something similar to it
2013-02-27 20:18:29	steventrevathan	http://pastie.org/6349356
2013-02-27 20:18:31	steventrevathan	here's my error
2013-02-27 20:18:42	PlaygroundInc	I was getting an endless waterfall of them on page load myself -- compiling went fine, it's only when i went to get a page served from the browser that my terminal filled up with line after line of "warn: error raised: Error: accept EMFILE"
2013-02-27 20:18:50	steventrevathan	I think I actually need to restart to set it right
2013-02-27 20:19:27	steventrevathan	weird
2013-02-27 20:24:08	PlaygroundInc	I'm also getting trouble with what i can best describe as 'bad compiles' on this project -- has anyone experienced that? 
2013-02-27 20:24:35	PlaygroundInc	i.e., after a generate, various items are out of place, pieces of css are wrong
2013-02-27 20:24:53	PlaygroundInc	re-generating fixes the problem without a single code change
2013-02-27 20:24:54	steventrevathan	weird
2013-02-27 20:25:12	PlaygroundInc	but these bad compiles are happening once out of every 4-5 generates
2013-02-27 20:25:20	steventrevathan	I don't know if it's related, but when I make a code change, the first one I make will refresh the static files
2013-02-27 20:25:28	steventrevathan	(after setting the limit)
2013-02-27 20:25:31	steventrevathan	ulimit*
2013-02-27 20:25:49	steventrevathan	but after the first refresh, it won't update my code
2013-02-27 20:26:23	steventrevathan	seems like the ulimit is just a symptom of the actual problem
2013-02-27 20:26:52	steventrevathan	or rather that ulimit just hides the symptom, but the problem remains
2013-02-27 20:28:50	steventrevathan	very weird

2013-02-28 00:29:47	PlaygroundInc	probably should have -- i do a lot of design work, so my show-and-tell usually takes place over imgur. force of habit.
2013-02-28 00:30:35	PlaygroundInc	as far as i can tell, it's not a typo -- since the project generates fine
2013-02-28 00:30:42	PlaygroundInc	(i could be wrong, of course)
2013-02-28 00:52:41	PlaygroundInc	Hey steventrevathan, how large is your project?
2013-02-28 00:52:56	steventrevathan	whoa sorry, was away
2013-02-28 00:52:58	steventrevathan	:)
2013-02-28 00:53:39	steventrevathan	hmm nope, that's not actually mine
2013-02-28 00:54:48	steventrevathan	132 files large
2013-02-28 00:56:54	PlaygroundInc	I'm at 340ish
2013-02-28 00:57:55	PlaygroundInc	I found something curious, in that my stylesheet is getting cut off at 106496 characters without error
2013-02-28 00:58:04	PlaygroundInc	it just stops: 
2013-02-28 00:58:13	PlaygroundInc	….background:linear-gradient(to bottom, rg
2013-02-28 00:58:53	PlaygroundInc	wait a tic..
2013-02-28 00:59:46	steventrevathan	hmm
2013-02-28 00:59:47	PlaygroundInc	hmm, no, nothing
2013-02-28 01:00:30	steventrevathan	that's odd, takes me back to when I hit the stylesheet linking limit in IE7 :)
2013-02-28 01:00:46	PlaygroundInc	yeah, i'm wondering if it's a character limit
2013-02-28 01:00:58	steventrevathan	how many lines long is your sheet?
2013-02-28 01:01:33	PlaygroundInc	couldn't tell you, it's being generated from scss, spread across a dozen or so files
2013-02-28 01:01:38	steventrevathan	I've worked on sites with 9k before, and those were OK. So I imagine it'd have to be quite huge
2013-02-28 01:01:38	steventrevathan	ahh
2013-02-28 01:01:39	steventrevathan	ok
2013-02-28 01:01:55	PlaygroundInc	It's not 9k, probably half that
2013-02-28 01:02:11	PlaygroundInc	You worked on sites with 9k lines on docpad?
2013-02-28 01:02:38	steventrevathan	I'd just remove each sheet one at a time until I found the one causing the error
2013-02-28 01:02:42	PlaygroundInc	Sorry, to be clear -- yes, i'm not feeding plain css files.
2013-02-28 01:02:44	steventrevathan	not on docpad, no
2013-02-28 01:04:02	steventrevathan	it appears to me as either a template or css syntax error
2013-02-28 01:04:10	steventrevathan	=-(
2013-02-28 01:06:39	PlaygroundInc	docpad doesn't throw anything, which is curious
2013-02-28 01:06:50	PlaygroundInc	and it stops midline, which is the second curious thing
2013-02-28 01:11:45	PlaygroundInc	ok, so i'm thinking this is definitely some sort of character limit run-in
2013-02-28 01:12:03	PlaygroundInc	if i rearrange my scss imports

2013-02-28 14:53:56	Mikeumus	Good day everyone.  8)
2013-02-28 14:54:03	ashnur	morning Mikeumus 
2013-02-28 14:57:10	Mikeumus	so my plugin that I've been working on is making progress but turns out node in it's current stable version is having trouble with google.com's RSA. Thankfully luke seems to have claimed to fix the problem here so I'm loading luke's branch/fork of node like you would the url of a dependency and that seems to work actually but not for docpad. I'm getting this warning when trying to change the node engine in my docpad plugin: https://github
2013-02-28 14:58:12	Mikeumus	this warning:* warning: Skipped the unsupported plugin: gdocs due to engine
2013-02-28 14:58:47	Mikeumus	is there a way to let docpad chill on node versions and just continue with execution? 
2013-02-28 14:58:49	ashnur	google that "due to engine" part 
2013-02-28 14:58:58	ashnur	probably a package.json thing
2013-02-28 14:59:04	ashnur	what plugin is this?
2013-02-28 14:59:30	Mikeumus	my plugin here: https://github.com/mikeumus/docpad-plugin-gdocs
2013-02-28 15:00:27	Mikeumus	This is what I have currently in my node: engine in package.json: "node": "https://github.com/lukebayes/node/tree/tls-fix" it's unconventional, but seems to load some version of node.
2013-02-28 15:01:17	Mikeumus	which I'm assuming it's working like how you can load tarballs or urls for dependencies in package.json 
2013-02-28 15:06:31	ashnur	it might be that you need the same engine for everything
2013-02-28 15:06:59	ashnur	i don't know, i never messed with these. you should really check that error message, i am sure other had this issue too
2013-02-28 15:07:14	Mikeumus	yeah I thought that too. I have the same node engine for docpad module, my plugin and the entire project but it still gave that error. 
2013-02-28 15:08:01	Mikeumus	yeah I haven't actually searched it yet, I imagined it's a fringe issue but good idea, I'll search it now. 
2013-02-28 15:10:15	Mikeumus	this guy mentions it here: https://github.com/bevry/docpad/issues/235
2013-02-28 15:10:51	Mikeumus	except I don't get any error when I load a normal version of node so I don't know if it's something wrong with my code besides it not liking my package.json's node engine
2013-02-28 15:11:19	Mikeumus	I'll keep trying a few things and then port it on stack overflow
2013-02-28 15:11:33	Mikeumus	thanks for your thoughts ashnur
2013-02-28 15:11:34	Mikeumus	8)
2013-02-28 15:21:23	Mikeumus	docpad.coffee would be an ideal place for an override of node engines. I'm going to see if I can do it that way with a slight customization to docpad.

2013-02-28 16:11:51	Mikeumus	looks like config ma already have something for it here: docpad.config.skipUnsupportedPlugins
2013-02-28 16:12:20	Mikeumus	if unsupported is 'version' and  docpad.config.skipUnsupportedPlugins is false
2013-02-28 16:12:33	Mikeumus	in docpad.coffee
2013-02-28 16:20:09	Mikeumus	ohh it's on the docs page too I just missed it when I skimmed over: http://docpad.org/docs/config

2013-03-01 21:20:02	dhbaird	Hey guys, I think I am having a problem prototypes in Docpad interfering with other libraries.
2013-03-01 21:27:37	ashnur	dhbaird: what kind of problem?
2013-03-01 21:29:53	dhbaird	I posted an issue last night here, https://github.com/bevry/docpad/issues/441
2013-03-01 21:30:02	dhbaird	...and today I have been trying to track it down.
2013-03-01 21:30:52	dhbaird	I narrowed it down to if I disable out/lib/prototypes.js, then the problem goes away (but may cause trouble in Docpad, I don't know)
2013-03-01 21:31:13	dhbaird	Got the source now and looking at the coffee-script
2013-03-01 21:46:32	dhbaird	Okay, I just narrowed it down to Array::remove. If I disable Array::remove in src/lib/prototypes.coffee then it looks like the issue is resolved. But, I assume those lines must have been there for a reason, and probably might now break Docpad.

2013-03-01 21:59:25	FredericL	anyone know why the text-plugin doesn't seem to handle properly html embedded in markdown text?
2013-03-01 22:00:13	FredericL	I have posted a question on SO: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14986835/text-plugin-embedded-html ... but unfortunately no answers
2013-03-01 22:00:50	FredericL	I'm therefore trying to get my chance here :)
2013-03-01 22:13:12	FredericL	Well it looks like it won't be any better here ... starting to wonder if I should not find/use a json file based database approach and stick with express.js - in many cases it should be easier (except for pure static site for which docpad is obviously the way to go) ...
2013-03-01 22:14:26	ashnur	FredericL: it will
2013-03-01 22:14:32	ashnur	but you have to wait a long time
2013-03-01 22:14:37	ashnur	because i don't have a clue
2013-03-01 22:14:46	ashnur	but sometimes balupton comes around
2013-03-01 22:14:58	ashnur	and he definitely can help if he has time 
2013-03-01 22:20:58	FredericL	well, unfortunately, I have to go and when I'll come back anything that would have been published in the mean time will be unavailable to me ...

2013-03-04 13:01:22	supersym	heya
2013-03-04 13:02:53	ashnur	morning
2013-03-04 13:04:07	supersym	say, am I correct to conlude there isnt a multimarkdown parser written in JS>?
2013-03-04 13:05:32	ashnur	what is a multimarkdown
2013-03-04 13:06:54	supersym	lol ok :P
2013-03-04 13:07:02	supersym	do i bite or not...
2013-03-04 13:08:14	ashnur	sry
2013-03-04 13:09:31	supersym	well... as Im investigating Markdown dialects, and now rebuilding the .cc sources and gyp bindings to node.js, I wondered so
2013-03-04 13:10:31	supersym	there is a Markdown one, and I found a CoffeeScript implementation I forked and hacked into italic text added Creole wiki syntax so 3 options _italic text_ or *italic* or //italic//
2013-03-04 13:11:02	supersym	anyway... John Gruber, creator of Markdown said design reason was readability,..so not too much signs that feel like Markup
2013-03-04 13:11:19	supersym	but Markdown misses on some low hanging fruits imho
2013-03-04 13:11:36	supersym	and Multimarkdown is much more complete (95% of what I'd ever want)
2013-03-04 13:11:47	supersym	has footnotes and simple bibtex references
2013-03-04 13:12:16	supersym	seperate file for references and xslt parsing..only a librarian wouldnt be fully satisfied by it :)
2013-03-04 13:12:31	supersym	https://github.com/fletcher/MultiMarkdown/wiki/MultiMarkdown-Syntax-Guide
2013-03-04 13:13:39	ashnur	ok
2013-03-04 13:13:44	supersym	its not so much the meta-data that I miss, nor tables... I dont use that often
2013-03-04 13:13:50	supersym	but the other 'hacks' are cool
2013-03-04 13:14:19	supersym	i forked this https://github.com/coffeebook/darkmown
2013-03-04 13:14:39	supersym	I guess I could see how easy it is to add some regex for a few of those multimarkdown properties
2013-03-04 13:15:10	supersym	(coffeebook is my literate programming/blogging next-gen effort/ideas bundled)
2013-03-04 13:16:49	supersym	I actually have a few great ideas inspired by Confluence (wiki-like easy to manage website by Atlassian from Bitbucket) and LightTable (Clojure next-gen IDE)
2013-03-04 13:18:09	supersym	and Markdown (or dialects, wiki-like subset languages of HTML) is obviously part of it as I don't want 100% GUI control over my 'books' that are literate programming snippets
2013-03-04 13:20:18	supersym	(Ideally I'd like drag drop texts that are also editable, in-line contenteditable HTML elements with several views like e.g. like http://oscargodson.github.com/EpicEditor/)
2013-03-04 13:21:01	supersym	http://tympanus.net/Development/FlipboardPageLayout/
2013-03-04 13:21:19	supersym	the last one would be about the same interaction that makes the eye-candy and keeps design clean
2013-03-04 13:22:21	supersym	you'd be able to "switch" literate code => contextual code explanation based upon a 'base level' of programming understanding and experience and viewed from seperate scientific fields perhaps ~> pure math, or logic or linguistic, or OOP or TDD
2013-03-04 13:22:51	supersym	and as a business Idea perhaps host and share code snippets from that perspective free and open-source
2013-03-04 13:23:06	supersym	but 'sell' or 'trade' more or less self contained snippets
2013-03-04 13:23:32	supersym	which would allow a pure coder to just write good code, someone to explain it could be another person and they share the 'gains'
2013-03-04 13:24:01	supersym	offering a perhaps not yet seen way of collaboration and freelancing
2013-03-04 13:24:33	supersym	without the focus too much on $$$ as others might do (30 bucks a month for simple stuff is a rip-off sometimes)
2013-03-04 13:25:20	supersym	a literate programming IDE if you will
2013-03-04 13:26:41	supersym	I do need to learn a bit more about the concepts of (un) 'weave' and macros as the LaTeX literate programming languages (Haskell, Clojure) and what they do at the moment with Macros and Monads
2013-03-04 13:26:56	supersym	and decide what is too difficult or complicated or hairy :P
2013-03-04 13:27:04	supersym	take the best parts of those ideas tho
2013-03-04 13:31:33	supersym	ahh good... npm multimarkdown wrapper in node still uses node-waf cos the node-gyp bindings script was broken :P sweet I can move on
2013-03-04 13:35:14	ashnur	i remember somebody here writing A LOT. i do not remember if this was you or not :-S
2013-03-04 13:35:28	supersym	sorry :(
2013-03-04 13:35:32	supersym	yesh....
2013-03-04 13:35:33	supersym	><
2013-03-04 13:35:39	ashnur	no, don't take it like that
2013-03-04 13:35:45	ashnur	it's ok, i just can't keep up
2013-03-04 13:35:48	supersym	I should code more and talk less sometimes ;)
2013-03-04 13:35:53	supersym	its ok
2013-03-04 13:35:54	supersym	haha
2013-03-04 13:36:01	ashnur	be more conscise, i think that's the word :)
2013-03-04 13:36:06	supersym	yea
2013-03-04 13:36:40	supersym	thats the problem with these things tho... they come piece by piece not in order and sometimes in time, but atleast I write everything down
2013-03-04 13:36:47	supersym	its more about making *my* mind up
2013-03-04 13:36:50	supersym	as it goes
2013-03-04 13:37:01	supersym	complicated matter, for me anyway
2013-03-04 13:37:12	supersym	anything far from 'standard' too
2013-03-04 13:39:24	supersym	oh well I'll bind and sort all the info for publishing to others I guess... should start up a few projects to eventually make a buck or two
2013-03-04 13:39:50	supersym	so no reason I cant base this all on open-source and without whoring out my principles
2013-03-04 13:43:26	supersym	to me, its about trying to offer normal folks like you and me a easy light-but-powerful online IDE for working on text and code, semi-automated intelligent best practices... example: in Sublime when I write markdown I do [ and get [I] where I write text of the anchor then move 1 position the cursor to the right outside brackets []I and open again to [Title][I] or [Title](I) and type eventually
2013-03-04 13:43:26	supersym	[Title](http://urltoolongoften...) or [Title][codeabc] and have to do a lot of returns to do [codeabc]: <http://...> so all I still get are automatically closed brackets still ><
2013-03-04 13:43:38	supersym	That is unacceptable much effort for a lazy person like me
2013-03-04 13:44:08	supersym	(j/k - but it illustrates a good example)
2013-03-04 13:44:42	supersym	also no online live editor & preview of MultiMarkdown I can find
2013-03-04 13:44:45	supersym	only Mac Apps
2013-03-04 13:44:47	supersym	$$$
2013-03-04 13:45:13	supersym	sorry I go again... but hey, still the same subject right? :)
2013-03-04 13:45:46	ashnur	:D
2013-03-04 13:46:30	supersym	sooo forked epiceditor, time to see what markdown js parser they use and hack its regex, hopefully not too hard
2013-03-04 13:46:41	ashnur	good luck
2013-03-04 13:46:51	supersym	i begin to learn much of regex finally
2013-03-04 13:47:04	supersym	learning some clojure helped a lot too :)
2013-03-04 13:47:05	supersym	thnx

2013-03-04 14:56:34	supersym	see if we can bundle some strengths
2013-03-04 14:57:58	supersym	also balupton might be interested to take a look from a language agnostic view,...

2013-03-06 13:56:56	ashnur	it is still going on
2013-03-06 13:56:56	ashnur	any major improvement?
2013-03-06 13:56:56	ashnur	or i should just wait until it's done and read the changelog :D
2013-03-06 14:20:00	balupton	wait until it's done
2013-03-06 14:20:14	balupton	still a fair bit to go
2013-03-06 14:20:29	balupton	yeah, 4 major releases to go, 3/4 done
2013-03-06 14:20:35	balupton	just ramping up all the plugins now
2013-03-06 14:29:31	zenorocha	you should blog about your release process
2013-03-06 14:29:51	zenorocha	it's insanely fast
2013-03-06 14:44:04	balupton	yeah, we will be documenting it all soon
2013-03-06 14:44:09	balupton	bringing on more core devs
2013-03-06 14:44:23	balupton	or rather Chase_the_Dev is joining the core team :)
2013-03-06 14:46:07	ashnur	?
2013-03-06 14:46:15	ashnur	whos that?
2013-03-06 14:46:58	balupton	chase coleman - you can see his contributions via http://bevry.me/about
2013-03-06 14:47:57	balupton	then hopefully bring on more core maintainers as the process irons out
2013-03-06 14:55:26	ashnur	very good
2013-03-06 14:55:46	ashnur	i would love to see docpad get a bit of acceleration
2013-03-06 14:56:29	zenorocha	awesome
2013-03-06 14:58:38	zenorocha	balupton: any idea when the ghpages deploy plugin will be available?
2013-03-06 15:01:22	balupton	aiming for the next hour
2013-03-06 15:07:19	zenorocha	awesome!
2013-03-06 15:17:46	ashnur	interesting. i had no problem deploying to ghpages without a plugin. 
2013-03-06 15:17:59	ashnur	zenorocha: what is this plugin going to add?
2013-03-06 15:18:36	zenorocha	a uniform way to deploy to github pages
2013-03-06 15:18:55	zenorocha	different people were using different ways to do it
2013-03-06 15:26:06	ashnur	got it
2013-03-06 15:26:09	ashnur	makes sense
2013-03-06 15:26:25	ashnur	there must be order :D
2013-03-06 15:56:09	zenorocha	balupton: I had a problem with docpad deploy-ghpages plugin

2013-03-06 15:57:24	zenorocha	http://cl.ly/image/0i0Z1A0i3x3A
2013-03-06 15:57:32	zenorocha	some conflict with partials plugin maybe
2013-03-06 16:00:48	balupton	you move too fast
2013-03-06 16:00:54	balupton	not done yet with the upgrades
2013-03-06 16:00:55	balupton	;)
2013-03-06 16:01:33	balupton	v6.24 has some b/c breaks with a few plugins - I've fixed all the b/c breaks locally, still pushing them live
2013-03-06 16:01:43	balupton	actually, I just did the partials plugin just then
2013-03-06 16:01:55	balupton	try partials v2.5.0
2013-03-06 16:02:16	balupton	but best to hold out until I'm done upgrading everything
2013-03-06 16:02:22	balupton	3 weeks of updates is a lot of updates
2013-03-06 16:09:05	zenorocha	eheheh

2013-03-06 18:43:26	steventrevathan	zenorocha: cool
2013-03-06 18:43:40	zenorocha	thanks steven for the tip
2013-03-06 18:43:58	steventrevathan	no problem, glad to help - also glad to see the partials system working nicely
2013-03-06 18:46:34	zenorocha	https://github.com/zenorocha/browser-diet/blob/master/src/layouts/default.html.eco#L60
2013-03-06 18:46:46	zenorocha	now I just need a better way to loop through those partials :)
2013-03-06 18:46:54	zenorocha	man, this project will be awesome
2013-03-06 18:47:14	zenorocha	it's going online on saturday \o/

2013-03-06 19:10:51	steventrevathan	this isn't actual code, but I would try to think of a way to do it like this: http://pastie.org/6405728
2013-03-06 19:10:54	steventrevathan	zenorocha: 
2013-03-06 19:11:22	zenorocha	yeah
2013-03-06 19:11:24	steventrevathan	whoops, the referenced template would also be like "tagged.template"
2013-03-06 19:11:26	zenorocha	seems like a better idea
2013-03-06 19:11:47	steventrevathan	not really sure how things are behind the scenes for you
2013-03-06 19:11:52	steventrevathan	but that's something to think about
2013-03-06 19:12:00	zenorocha	I think I'll create an array
2013-03-06 19:12:01	zenorocha	https://github.com/braziljs/conf-boilerplate/blob/master/docpad.coffee#L26
2013-03-06 19:12:06	zenorocha	just like I did at confboilerplate
2013-03-06 19:12:08	steventrevathan	if you're looking for saturday and this sort of thing already works, you might as well optimize it later
2013-03-06 19:12:24	zenorocha	and then
2013-03-06 19:12:28	steventrevathan	sweet
2013-03-06 19:12:29	zenorocha	https://github.com/braziljs/conf-boilerplate/blob/master/src/documents/index.html.eco#L5
2013-03-06 19:13:31	steventrevathan	nice
2013-03-06 19:13:33	steventrevathan	that looks great
2013-03-06 19:38:19	elf-pavlik	balupton: could you check out this issue with utf8 in feedr? https://github.com/bevry/feedr/issues/1
2013-03-06 19:39:28	elf-pavlik	zenorocha: i got our site running on conf-boilerplate with i18n which we do now using http://transifex.net and i just pull it in with feedr for now...
2013-03-06 19:40:38	zenorocha	elf-pavlil: great!
2013-03-06 19:40:52	zenorocha	so I've made a solution for i18n in another project this weekend
2013-03-06 19:40:54	zenorocha	check it out
2013-03-06 19:40:54	zenorocha	https://github.com/zenorocha/browser-diet/blob/master/docpad.coffee#L11
2013-03-06 19:42:05	zenorocha	elf-pavlik: I didn't translate it to english yet
2013-03-06 19:42:17	zenorocha	but I think it was a good solution for small websites
2013-03-06 19:43:12	elf-pavlik	zenorocha: https://github.com/OuiShare/ouisharefest/commit/e78749add03b6c5e95a787d048750b2eea4b43cd
2013-03-06 19:44:37	elf-pavlik	and https://github.com/OuiShare/ouisharefest/blob/master/src/layouts/default.html.eco#L1
2013-03-06 19:45:14	elf-pavlik	but just because i wanted to add it on transifex and now people have contributed 9 translations just if few days :)
2013-03-06 19:46:20	elf-pavlik	zenorocha: do you know if i can get json from local files with feedr? or using other plugin?
2013-03-06 19:46:36	zenorocha	elf-pavlik: wow that's awesome
2013-03-06 19:46:40	zenorocha	didn't know about this tool
2013-03-06 19:47:01	elf-pavlik	ehm... http://ouisharefest.com/pt_BR/ ;)
2013-03-06 19:49:21	zenorocha	uhu! \o/
2013-03-06 19:50:40	elf-pavlik	also since transifex doesn't support JSON but has great support for YAML this comes handy https://github.com/OuiShare/ouisharefest/blob/master/Makefile
2013-03-06 19:52:01	elf-pavlik	simple hash in YAML have same representation as in CSON :) so putting them under json.cson gives a hackish way to pull them in with feedr later on... but i want to switch to local files asap and then convert cson->json with make...

2013-03-09 13:23:21	ashnur	pleas don't paste code in the channel
2013-03-09 13:23:34	ashnur	try pastie.org, or a gist, or something similar
2013-03-09 13:24:08	ashnur	the issue you are experiencing I had with earlier versions of docpad, and I do not know what causes it
2013-03-09 13:24:42	ashnur	it was coming and going, not a persistent one
2013-03-09 13:24:54	ashnur	can you reproduce it at any time with that code?
2013-03-09 13:25:21	ashnur	could you perhaps create a bare docpad project and put up on github so that I could clone it and try it myself?
2013-03-09 13:25:34	ashnur	that would help a LOT
2013-03-09 13:29:44	UberSandMAn	it happens with any docpad cli command
2013-03-09 13:29:51	UberSandMAn	docpad scaffold
2013-03-09 13:29:54	UberSandMAn	docpad run
2013-03-09 13:30:00	UberSandMAn	with blank directory
2013-03-09 13:30:23	ashnur	that is good
2013-03-09 13:30:29	ashnur	i never had that
2013-03-09 13:30:45	ashnur	but this would make debugging much easier
2013-03-09 13:31:52	UberSandMAn	any thoughts on how I might reveal the problem here?
2013-03-09 13:32:05	UberSandMAn	is process return bad data?
2013-03-09 13:32:40	UberSandMAn	OS is Windows 7 x86

2013-03-09 13:37:56	UberSandMAn	coffee-script@1.4.0  docpad-plugin-coffeescript@2.1.3
2013-03-09 13:40:03	ashnur	well
2013-03-09 13:40:14	ashnur	i usually use debug and debugger

2013-03-09 13:42:22	UberSandMAn	ok
2013-03-09 13:43:28	UberSandMAn	what I wanted to do was write a page which rewrote the three scripts, so I can debug it out of docpad

2013-03-09 21:37:49	steventrevathan	hey guys
2013-03-09 21:38:07	steventrevathan	is there something special about docpad's markdown syntax that doesn't allow my to link using [This link](http://example.net/)
2013-03-09 21:39:49	steventrevathan	strange that it just prints, instead of following standard markdown rendering
2013-03-09 21:57:13	steventrevathan	I have marked installed, and the file extension is .html.md
2013-03-09 21:57:28	steventrevathan	any suggestions as to why this might not work?

2013-03-09 22:02:52	steventrevathan	but it's all rendering as text, with this rage on our team page: <p><%= member.content %></p>
2013-03-09 22:03:05	steventrevathan	wondering if there's a method for rendering I need

2013-03-10 00:50:46	Mikeumus	cool, I'my working with my friend at starbucks, my local version of node was dated.
2013-03-10 00:50:53	Mikeumus	another big noob mistake, lol sorry
2013-03-10 00:51:01	Mikeumus	It's ngorning the skip now
2013-03-10 00:51:07	Mikeumus	I'll close the issue.
2013-03-10 00:51:10	Mikeumus	sorry about that
2013-03-10 00:52:56	Mikeumus	I replied to your post. thanks for looking into it Matt.
2013-03-10 01:06:53	balupton	no worries, we all mistakes :)
2013-03-10 01:23:45	Mikeumus	so now that we're creating docpad pages form published google docs, we're learning about the nativecomments plugin and queryengine. How do you delete/remove things rom the database? I tried deleted the comments I created from the comments/ folder but they are still listed on the comment block page but clicking on their links shows a 404? 
2013-03-10 01:24:58	Mikeumus	ohh looks stopping and starting docpad rids the listed comments.
2013-03-10 01:32:10	Mikeumus	so now we may be extending nativecomments to not require cycling the docpad server to have the deleted comments listed any longer.
2013-03-10 01:34:39	Mikeumus	The link to the live Query Engine demo in the QueryEngine Wiki "Usage" page under "Tying it all together" is no good.

2013-03-10 09:49:37	jopt	Heya. Not sure if anyone reads this
2013-03-10 09:49:46	jopt	Anyway, something you might want to look into
2013-03-10 09:50:11	jopt	I'm playing with docpad for the first time. Some experience with node though.
2013-03-10 09:50:17	ashnur	you can be sure that someone reads it :)
2013-03-10 09:50:28	jopt	The install wasn't painless, but I finally figured it out
2013-03-10 09:50:35	jopt	I did the "docpad run" in an empty directory
2013-03-10 09:50:45	jopt	Then installed plugins and so on as per the beignner guide
2013-03-10 09:50:53	ashnur	the install can be painless if one follows the instructions by word
2013-03-10 09:50:58	jopt	Problem was docpad never loaded the eco plugin
2013-03-10 09:51:08	ashnur	hmm
2013-03-10 09:51:18	jopt	Turns out the initial "docpad run" never created an empty pacakge.json
2013-03-10 09:51:32	ashnur	i don't think it should do it
2013-03-10 09:51:40	jopt	So even though the instructions told me to (word by word) install the eco plugin with npm
2013-03-10 09:52:03	jopt	The installed eco plugin didn't register in the package.json, because there was no package.json
2013-03-10 09:52:28	jopt	As soon as I realised this is where docpad looks for plugins to load, I jsut added a empty "{}" file, and hey problem solved
2013-03-10 09:52:52	jopt	So yeah
2013-03-10 09:53:18	jopt	Doing npm with --save doesn't seem to be enough if package-json is missing
2013-03-10 09:53:39	ashnur	yeah, i don't know why it was missing
2013-03-10 09:53:40	jopt	And running docpad without a valid dependencies in package.json means no plugins loaded
2013-03-10 09:54:00	jopt	ash: Should it have been created by the initial "docpad run"
2013-03-10 09:54:03	jopt	?
2013-03-10 09:54:19	ashnur	maybe if you could reproduce this, it certainly worths opening an issue on github 
2013-03-10 09:54:41	jopt	Right, I can try that
2013-03-10 09:55:20	jopt	To be clear: is the problem that "docpad run" didn't create a package.json, or is that something that "npm install --save ..." should do?
2013-03-10 09:55:25	ashnur	sadly, I don't know. i have not installed a new docpad project for some weeks now, might be a new error, or something I have not noticed before and thought it was my mistake rather than docpad's
2013-03-10 09:55:33	jopt	Cool.
2013-03-10 09:55:59	ashnur	but if you do what the guide says, and it doesn't work, that is a problem
2013-03-10 09:56:09	ashnur	no matter where it is wrong
2013-03-10 09:56:26	jopt	So I thought. The guide might need an extra line
2013-03-10 09:56:32	jopt	See ya

2013-03-10 14:54:48	codehero	hello, I am going through the "quick start from scratch" tutorial, but whenever I `docpad run` it says I do not have the plugins installed
2013-03-10 14:55:08	codehero	and I did make sure to run the npm install command in step 2
2013-03-10 15:04:51	codehero	OK I get it, the quick start directions failed to mention that you need to create a "node_modules" directory before step 2
2013-03-10 15:07:57	ashnur	code
2013-03-10 15:08:00	ashnur	run npm install
2013-03-10 15:08:18	ashnur	codehero ↑
2013-03-10 15:09:05	codehero	I made the directory and its working now
2013-03-10 15:09:23	codehero	and reran npm install plugins
2013-03-10 15:11:38	ashnur	the npm install SHOULD create that directory
2013-03-10 15:13:52	codehero	`npm install` does not do that
2013-03-10 15:14:02	codehero	`npm install` installs whatever package is in that directory
2013-03-10 15:14:15	codehero	it does not initialize
2013-03-10 15:18:31	ashnur	codehero: I am sorry to say otherwise, but I just tested it, and npm install <pkgname> creates the directory if it's not present, and given a proper package.json file so does a simple `npm install` 
2013-03-10 15:19:05	ashnur	i have not said that npm install 'initializes' i just said, that it should create the node_modules directory
2013-03-10 15:19:09	codehero	what version of npm?
2013-03-10 15:19:31	codehero	I have 1.1.66
2013-03-10 15:19:34	ashnur	i remember it working like this since I am using it
2013-03-10 15:19:44	codehero	well I have different behaviour
2013-03-10 15:19:56	codehero	it does not create a directory
2013-03-10 15:20:44	codehero	npm is installing globally, not locally
2013-03-10 15:21:16	ashnur	that should not happen
2013-03-10 15:21:22	ashnur	it never did that
2013-03-10 15:21:29	ashnur	unless you provided the -g
2013-03-10 15:21:35	codehero	nope
2013-03-10 15:21:42	ashnur	then something is very wrong
2013-03-10 15:22:18	codehero	I have seen things break and change in node over the past few years
2013-03-10 15:22:23	codehero	I am not surprised we see different things
2013-03-10 15:24:51	codehero	http://pastebin.com/U6huY7bq
2013-03-10 15:24:55	codehero	for reference
2013-03-10 15:26:59	ashnur	that is probably because you have in the path somewhere a node_modules
2013-03-10 15:27:03	ashnur	try /tmp
2013-03-10 15:27:13	codehero	I do have a local node_modules install
2013-03-10 15:27:32	ashnur	that is not what I am saying
2013-03-10 15:27:34	ashnur	:)
2013-03-10 15:27:36	codehero	so that's probably it
2013-03-10 15:27:53	ashnur	somewhere along the way upwards there is a directory in which you have node_modules, and it uses that
2013-03-10 15:27:59	codehero	yes exactly what I mean
2013-03-10 15:28:14	codehero	ok that is the mystery
2013-03-10 15:28:16	ashnur	ok, then we do agree
2013-03-10 15:28:29	ashnur	it's not mistery, it's how it's working. 
2013-03-10 15:28:45	ashnur	tries the curent dir then upwards along the path.
2013-03-10 15:29:07	ashnur	because if you are IN a project, you do not want your modules scattered around
2013-03-10 15:29:41	codehero	ic, so a node noob like shoots themself in the foot by placing my modules in my home
2013-03-10 15:29:48	codehero	which is what was recommended a long time ago
2013-03-10 15:30:18	ashnur	yeah, i had a problem with that when I was not switching from nvm 
2013-03-10 15:30:24	codehero	I need a different NODE_PATH
2013-03-10 15:30:34	ashnur	what distro are you using?
2013-03-10 15:30:39	codehero	gentoo
2013-03-10 15:30:42	ashnur	:)
2013-03-10 15:30:46	codehero	I don't use the distro install though
2013-03-10 15:30:50	ashnur	yeah
2013-03-10 15:30:53	ashnur	that was my mistake
2013-03-10 15:31:08	ashnur	look, if they follow the realeases as well as arch does, it worths it
2013-03-10 15:31:17	ashnur	less headache. i had the EXACT same problem
2013-03-10 15:31:32	ashnur	i was using nvm, it had a node_modules in my home, fucked up everything 
2013-03-10 15:31:51	ashnur	now i have to use sudo to install global
2013-03-10 15:31:58	codehero	ugh
2013-03-10 15:32:14	ashnur	yes, but you can work around that too
2013-03-10 15:32:18	ashnur	i am just too lazy
2013-03-10 15:32:40	ashnur	and it's global, so all users can use those
2013-03-10 15:33:12	ashnur	which can be helpful for dev situations when you want to run daemons with different user than yours
2013-03-10 15:33:18	ashnur	it's a bit cleaner
2013-03-10 15:33:24	codehero	right
2013-03-10 15:33:31	ashnur	anyway, your decision, at least we figured out why it behaves differently
2013-03-10 15:33:32	codehero	well maybe you can help me with my next issue
2013-03-10 15:33:49	codehero	all I get is "Not found" when I go to localhost:9778
2013-03-10 15:34:02	ashnur	404?
2013-03-10 15:34:02	codehero	I have copied the sample files verbatim
2013-03-10 15:34:18	codehero	yes
2013-03-10 15:34:39	ashnur	i guess that your project doesn't have an index.html in it's out dir, which is probably because there is no source files which would be translated to that
2013-03-10 15:35:05	codehero	I did not see any instructions to create that file
2013-03-10 15:35:30	codehero	I also do not see the out/posts/hello.htm file
2013-03-10 15:35:36	ashnur	it's in the beginner guide
2013-03-10 15:35:37	codehero	it is hello.eco instead
2013-03-10 15:35:52	codehero	so should I be using the "from scratch" guide then?
2013-03-10 15:36:15	codehero	I sort of expected something working from that
2013-03-10 15:36:22	ashnur	i do not know about a "from scratch" guide
2013-03-10 15:36:27	ashnur	maybe that's something new
2013-03-10 15:36:29	codehero	http://docpad.org/docs/start
2013-03-10 15:36:50	ashnur	found it
2013-03-10 15:37:46	ashnur	that would work if you have docpad globally installed and then do that
2013-03-10 15:38:02	ashnur	you must have the docpad command (binary in your path :D )
2013-03-10 15:38:10	codehero	it is in my path
2013-03-10 15:38:37	ashnur	kewl
2013-03-10 15:39:08	codehero	I think the directions are a bit misleading
2013-03-10 15:39:11	ashnur	so i guess that guide creates a hello.html which you can see in your browser if you type that url 
2013-03-10 15:39:19	codehero	I did not want a premade site so I did not run the `docpad run` command
2013-03-10 15:39:59	ashnur	if you think that any part of the site/documentation could be included, the docpad team is very welcoming for suggestions, i urge you to open an issue on github 
2013-03-10 15:40:14	codehero	k
2013-03-10 15:41:11	ashnur	 there are not many people working on this, and I know that they have many things in their mind on how to go forward, but they always respond to issues or questions on stackoverflow, and if they are here, then here too
2013-03-10 15:43:14	codehero	cool, thanks for all your help

2013-03-12 14:34:53	puneri	New to DocPad and JS. Willing to learn. I have started with Beginner Guide after I spent time on installing and configuring. The question is : In Guide when I pull first pluging then do I have the copy or installation of pluging inside the folder where I'm working on the website or its fetched everytime I run the website ?
2013-03-12 14:46:42	ashnur	I am sorry, but I don't understand your question
2013-03-12 14:47:25	ashnur	i assume pluging is plugin? 
2013-03-12 14:47:45	ashnur	can you give an exact reference to what part of the beginner guide you meant? 
2013-03-12 14:48:58	puneri	Sorry for type. When I run npm install --save docpad-plugin-eco then is in downloading and installing the plugin inside node_modules ?
2013-03-12 14:49:47	ashnur	yes
2013-03-12 14:50:11	ashnur	npm is a package manager for node.js
2013-03-12 14:58:13	puneri	ok. Thanks. Now without package.json how does node application works with the two plugins as described in Beginner Guide ?
2013-03-12 15:04:55	ashnur	puneri: when you installed docpad with -g, you installed it globally. in it's directory, where you have installed it, there is a package.json
2013-03-12 15:05:22	ashnur	but a package.json is not required for a node app to work, that is just for packaging and maybe some further metadata
2013-03-12 15:05:32	puneri	ok thanks
2013-03-12 15:05:46	ashnur	and if you install plugins, they will also have package.json files in their own directories
2013-03-12 15:06:58	ashnur	if you want to write your own module for node.js, which is a kewl thing to do (writing as many modules as you can :) ), npm init in a directory will help creating a package.json file by prompting for the various fields 
2013-03-12 15:16:42	puneri	okk
2013-03-12 15:16:53	puneri	What if I wish to create a virtualenv for docpad
2013-03-12 15:19:28	ashnur	why would you want to do that?
2013-03-12 15:19:49	ashnur	or maybe I am not sure what do you mean by virtualenv
2013-03-12 15:21:01	puneri	Instead of docpad being in /usr/local/ lets have it in the directory where I'm creating the website.
2013-03-12 15:21:41	ashnur	docpad is a tool, putting it in the same directory with your website is probably not a good idea
2013-03-12 15:22:29	ashnur	and if you read up on npm, you can install docpad anywhere and use it from there, i don't think that will be a problem, and I do not think it needs a virtualenv
2013-03-12 15:29:15	puneri	Thanks. As a begineer is it advisable to start with DocPad without knowledge of any other webtech ?

2013-03-20 13:22:47	supersym	what are you using now? Awesome?
2013-03-20 13:24:39	supersym	I was anyway and I got tired of the WM breaking (like really break-break) everytime I made a typo... xmonad doesn't do that (when working on config files)
2013-03-20 13:38:01	balupton	http://startuphostel.org is now up :)
2013-03-20 13:38:09	balupton	what do you all think? :)
2013-03-20 13:41:01	balupton	still want a few bits of isolated feedback before I go hustling mad on it - probably next week I'll ramp it up like mad
2013-03-20 13:41:29	supersym	what do you want feedback on
2013-03-20 13:41:37	balupton	everything, anything :)
2013-03-20 13:42:58	balupton	but for now I got to go to bed, if you want you can post the feedback here (I'll check it later) or email it to feedback@startuphostel.org
2013-03-20 13:43:20	balupton	and as always, thanks everyone for being so awesome - we have such a great community here, it is very humbling to see :)
2013-03-20 14:37:05	supersym	:)
2013-03-20 14:38:26	supersym	cool... I've been wanting to talk to you about this anyway... I am in early stages of exploring some local hackerschool/seminair reconnaissance so I had some questions on this anyway
2013-03-20 14:40:05	supersym	I got my sound/mic working decently so I'm still game for one or two Skype sessions but I'll write down some comments/questions I have on startuphostel and mail you any things that fit in a bullitlist
2013-03-20 14:40:39	supersym	not needed to skype on misalignment here, typo there... :P

2013-03-20 20:14:18	ashnur	hmm?
2013-03-20 20:14:51	ashnur	it's not like xmonad of course, but I've been using it for more than a year now, and had no problems
2013-03-20 20:19:11	supersym	oh i thought it was the javascript window manager, not sure why but I could be wrong
2013-03-20 20:19:43	supersym	@balupton: we have a coffeekup, not coffeecup plugin at docpad. I think thats the old, original project, with no stylus support built in?
2013-03-20 20:38:37	ashnur	supersym: well, it's node window manager

2013-03-20 21:08:16	supersym	@balupton: ok I see it doesn't work anymore altogether, the coffeekup plugin: "warning: Skipped the unsupported plugin: coffeecup due to engine"
2013-03-20 21:15:55	ashnur	change the engine :)
2013-03-20 21:16:01	supersym	i tried
2013-03-20 21:16:04	supersym	thats not the problem
2013-03-20 21:16:15	supersym	im looking a bit deeper but same engines as all other plugins
2013-03-20 21:16:24	supersym	i think it might be a semver mismatch
2013-03-20 21:16:51	supersym	nop
2013-03-20 21:16:53	supersym	beats me
2013-03-20 21:17:04	ashnur	anyway. use hamlcoffee :)
2013-03-20 21:17:13	ashnur	much better than coffekup
2013-03-20 21:17:22	supersym	haha ok I'll give it a try :)
2013-03-20 21:18:04	ashnur	maybe i have to update it too
2013-03-20 21:18:47	supersym	now I see
2013-03-20 21:18:54	supersym	somehow it thinks coffeecup is a plugin
2013-03-20 21:18:57	supersym	weird
2013-03-20 21:19:06	ashnur	hmm?
2013-03-20 21:19:10	supersym	it wasnt the docpad-plugin-coffeekup giving problems then cos I deleted that directory
2013-03-20 21:19:16	supersym	│warning: Skipped the unsupported plugin: coffeecup due to engine
2013-03-20 21:19:44	supersym	but only docpad, hamlcoffee,jade,stylus plugins are present.... plus a coffeecup
2013-03-20 21:20:29	supersym	yup now its gone
2013-03-20 21:20:46	supersym	thats weird...some bug in the plugin-loader is causing it to respond to a non-docpad package
2013-03-20 21:21:05	supersym	or it is intended that way but never was as far as I know
2013-03-20 21:32:08	supersym	this github speed/loadtimes are ridiculous
2013-03-20 21:32:17	supersym	god and it sucks for weeks on end now
2013-03-20 21:40:00	ashnur	...
2013-03-20 21:42:02	chrisbuchholz	Is it possible to have docpad running the server AND watching for changes at the same time?
2013-03-20 21:45:04	chrisbuchholz	I can run docpad server and docpad watch simultaniously in two seperate processes but how come there is not any built in support for this?
2013-03-20 22:08:00	ashnur	chrisbuchholz: yes, it is possible 
2013-03-20 22:09:21	ashnur	oh, i just read the second line 
2013-03-20 22:09:24	ashnur	:)
2013-03-20 22:10:34	ashnur	i think this is because (and I hope I am correct in this) originally docpad was a static site generator, and gradually got extended by a server, then dynamic pages, things like these. 
2013-03-20 22:11:03	ashnur	and it might be a better idea to generate pages in a different environment than the production
2013-03-20 22:11:19	ashnur	not with dynamic, but usually it's simpler

2013-03-25 02:46:20	mikeumus	Howdy
2013-03-25 02:48:11	mikeumus	I'm trying to set the uploadDir in docpad.coffee: uploadDir: 'uploads', but it's saying 'unexpected { ' 
2013-03-25 02:50:53	mikeumus	wait I jsut closed git bash and docpad run again and it's working... *scratch head*
2013-03-25 02:52:11	mikeumus	wait again, the file wasn't saved, back to error.
2013-03-25 02:54:06	mikeumus	Hey nexusIX, I got my plugin all setup now, just need to know how to set the uploadDir in docpad's docpad.coffee config. See: https://gist.github.com/mikeumus/21f4d57918f175ed7541
2013-03-25 02:55:20	nexusIX	This is how I do it: docpadConfig = {  ...other stuff...  uploadDir: __dirname + '/data/docs/'
2013-03-25 02:55:31	nexusIX	running out now, will be around later
2013-03-25 02:55:56	mikeumus	I'm trying to set it as the first thing and it's not diggin it. Alright, peace.
2013-03-25 02:56:08	mikeumus	I'll try putting it lower in the config
2013-03-25 02:57:43	mikeumus	interesting, I just put it a couple items lower and it's running now.

2013-03-25 03:26:24	mikeumus	I've mostly used the Bootstrap skelies thus far. I always though the Hogan skele was just a skele modeled after the Hogan website at the time.

2013-03-25 03:34:18	codehero	the hogan skeleton is written entirely in eco
2013-03-25 03:35:13	codehero	I'm assuming you are referring to this https://github.com/docpad/hogan.docpad

2013-03-29 13:09:41	supersym	Fun, while pondering about how to expand capabilities of docpad, I realized that its limited really by the language
2013-03-29 13:09:57	supersym	tho I wonder how a concurrent clojurescript program would compile to JS
2013-03-29 13:11:12	supersym	next web project I plan to write using Clojure to get some more practice, but its already clear to me why higher-functional languages pwn anyone

2013-04-07 21:27:38	nexusIX	codehero, take a look at https://docpad.org/docs/config
2013-04-07 21:28:08	nexusIX	it's coffeescript, but easy to translate to JS
2013-04-07 21:29:14	codehero	I'm not really familiar with coffeescript
2013-04-07 21:29:46	codehero	can I just compile it and get a useful .js file?
2013-04-07 21:33:39	nexusIX	yes
2013-04-07 21:33:59	nexusIX	the coffeescript-js translation is pretty simple
