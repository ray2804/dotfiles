2013-04-19 18:35:16	@bogdan	I'm lucky I follow the right people on Facebook, so I get all the appropriate etymology discussions on current events
2013-04-19 18:35:17	supersym	can someone tell me, what is "starting at", when talking about prices... is that like a quantifier or?
2013-04-19 18:35:43	@msk	bogdan: are you friends with tsarnaev
2013-04-19 18:35:51	@qfr	supersym, it means you start at a certain value and go up from there
2013-04-19 18:35:56	@qfr	Greater or equal to that value
2013-04-19 18:36:07	@qfr	"We have child prostitutes starting at 6 years"

2013-04-19 18:37:52	@msk	why do you want a name for it
2013-04-19 18:37:59	supersym	yeah.. 
2013-04-19 18:38:03	@qfr	I'm not sure there's a mroe specific linguistic name

2013-04-19 18:38:25	@bogdan	msk, no, some Romanian guy.
2013-04-19 18:38:25	supersym	I thought it just had quantifier-like properties since it limits the possible amount of something
2013-04-19 18:38:44	@qfr	Somewhat, but it implies more than that
2013-04-19 18:38:57	supersym	true
2013-04-19 18:39:21	@msk	doesn't stop it from being a quantifier
2013-04-19 18:40:11	supersym	anyway never knew there was a linguistics channel so I thought I'd just ask :) 
2013-04-19 18:40:19	@msk	i don't think it's one though
2013-04-19 18:40:29	@msk	otherwise you could replace it with another quantifier and still make sense
2013-04-19 18:40:35	supersym	I could have also just put it through the berkeley parser I just realised =.

2013-04-23 21:29:22	@Bogdan_	B-rat, then there's the different in pheromones, but that's not really "smell" as you can't feel them conciously.

2013-04-24 07:43:24	@lingbot	the B word: usually used to abbreviate the word bitch to avoid profanity, this expression can also be used by non-committals in reference to avoidance of the term boyfriend. Used in this way emphasizes word boyfriend as being more difficult to say than the word bitch, which if your a bit of a commitmentphobe who is hard-pressed for a relationship commitment is quite likely.

2013-04-24 07:44:52	@lingbot	the Y word: The Y.O. (Yonkers) is one of the chillest places in New York. It&#x27;s basically the Reno of the East Coast because it has a casino, prostitutes, and retarded cops. Every single person from Yonkers is an O.G. So the entire population is O.G., Proof: DMX, Jadakiss, Mary J Blige, and James Blake are all from Yonkers and the guy who invented FM radio, so without the Y.O. there would be no Hot 97. Conclusion: Yonkers is ball

2013-04-24 09:59:45	@saimazoon	well, if you're unsure, just ask me
2013-04-24 09:59:53	@saimazoon	or look it up in an etymological dictionary

2013-04-24 10:02:48	@saimazoon	zfe: turks didn't come up with a written language of their own until the foundation of the republic
2013-04-24 10:03:02	@saimazoon	prior to that point, it was a pastische of persian, arabic and a bit of turkish syntax
2013-04-24 10:03:10	@zfe	i know saimazoon
2013-04-24 10:03:15	@saimazoon	for the sultan's enjoyment, who i'm sure was always illiterate in both of them
2013-04-24 10:03:31	@zfe	i keep thinking though
2013-04-24 10:03:41	@zfe	that the structures taken by persian
2013-04-24 10:03:43	@zfe	could have been kept
2013-04-24 10:03:51	@zfe	as they are far less fucked up
2013-04-24 10:04:46	@zfe	anyway, i'm getting through it
2013-04-24 10:04:52	@zfe	still have some problems with "evidentiality"
2013-04-24 10:04:55	@saimazoon	that's only so if you've got an indo-european language background
2013-04-24 10:05:04	@zfe	but they have the same problems with our "imperfect"
2013-04-24 10:05:05	@saimazoon	zfe: basque has evidentiality markers too
2013-04-24 10:05:10	@saimazoon	and is left-branching, like turkish
2013-04-24 10:05:11	@zfe	and i can understand that it will take years to master it
2013-04-24 10:05:49	@saimazoon	zfe: many languages in the world are left-branching
2013-04-24 10:06:00	@zfe	saimazoon: even latin is rectum-regens
2013-04-24 10:06:02	@saimazoon	japanese and chinese are among the most widely-spoken
2013-04-24 10:06:03	@zfe	which is no big deal
2013-04-24 10:06:11	@zfe	that's the least of problems with turkish
2013-04-24 10:06:12	@saimazoon	i don't know any latin
2013-04-24 10:06:35	@saimazoon	what do you mean by "imperfect"
2013-04-24 10:06:39	@saimazoon	praeteritum imperfectum?
2013-04-24 10:06:49	@saimazoon	ego amaba, tu amabas, el amabat?
2013-04-24 10:07:02	@saimazoon	or the subjunctive
2013-04-24 10:07:06	@zfe	indefinite you must call it in spanish
2013-04-24 10:07:30	@saimazoon	preterito indefinido
2013-04-24 10:07:36	@saimazoon	that's like the simple past tense
2013-04-24 10:07:52	@saimazoon	it's a perfective tense, says the action is finished, and that it happened in the past
2013-04-24 10:08:08	@saimazoon	yo dije = söyledim
2013-04-24 10:08:23	@zfe	what's the difference in spanish then
2013-04-24 10:08:25	@zfe	between
2013-04-24 10:08:31	@zfe	yo he olvidado
2013-04-24 10:08:33	@saimazoon	yo decıa = söylüyordum
2013-04-24 10:08:38	@zfe	and yo olvidaba
2013-04-24 10:08:48	@saimazoon	yo he olvidado = yo olvide
2013-04-24 10:08:55	@saimazoon	people in the north tend to use the simple form more often
2013-04-24 10:08:57	@zfe	exactly the same?
2013-04-24 10:09:02	@saimazoon	and people in centre and south of spain, the compound tense
2013-04-24 10:09:02	@saimazoon	yes
2013-04-24 10:09:06	@saimazoon	it's pretty much like in german
2013-04-24 10:09:06	@zfe	that's curious
2013-04-24 10:09:14	@saimazoon	ich haben gesehen and ich sah
2013-04-24 10:09:19	@zfe	how do you say "when i was young i went to school blablabal"
2013-04-24 10:09:20	@saimazoon	or in romanian
2013-04-24 10:09:34	@saimazoon	eu am zis and .... i don't remember how to use the simple past in romanian, because it's very bookish
2013-04-24 10:09:38	@saimazoon	oh
2013-04-24 10:09:39	@saimazoon	yeah
2013-04-24 10:09:41	@saimazoon	that's quite another thing
2013-04-24 10:09:46	@saimazoon	yo he olvidado and yo olvide are perfective tenses
2013-04-24 10:09:53	@saimazoon	they tell you the action is done and finished
2013-04-24 10:09:54	@zfe	that's what i wanted to mean
2013-04-24 10:10:03	@zfe	turks have hard time understanding
2013-04-24 10:10:07	@zfe	indefinite past
2013-04-24 10:10:12	@Lysandros	"he olvidado" does not have the same uses as "olvidaba"
2013-04-24 10:10:13	@saimazoon	imperfective, "yo olvidaba" is more like "i was forgetting" or "I kept forgetting"
2013-04-24 10:10:20	@zfe	which at least in italian and latin mean
2013-04-24 10:10:25	@saimazoon	zfe: i don't think they do
2013-04-24 10:10:28	@zfe	1. routine actions in the past
2013-04-24 10:10:39	@saimazoon	i think turkish as tenses that translate pretty smoothly into spanish conjugations
2013-04-24 10:10:39	@zfe	and here they get it, cause turkish has a similar form
2013-04-24 10:10:47	@saimazoon	unuttum = yo olvidé
2013-04-24 10:10:47	@zfe	you use aor+past
2013-04-24 10:10:50	@zfe	gelirdim
2013-04-24 10:10:59	@zfe	giderdim
2013-04-24 10:11:00	@zfe	and such
2013-04-24 10:11:06	@saimazoon	unutuyordum = yo olvidaba
2013-04-24 10:11:16	@zfe	that would translate more like
2013-04-24 10:11:20	@zfe	"i was forgetting"
2013-04-24 10:11:26	@zfe	not "i used to forget"
2013-04-24 10:11:36	@saimazoon	that isn't the imperfective, zfe
2013-04-24 10:11:40	@saimazoon	gelirdim is the 'aorist'
2013-04-24 10:11:50	@zfe	saimazoon: turkish has no concept of "imperfective"
2013-04-24 10:11:52	@zfe	whatsoever
2013-04-24 10:12:07	@zfe	that's why they have problems, just like we have problems understanding the whole range of meanings and uses of mish
2013-04-24 10:12:16	@saimazoon	zfe: let's use an english example as a translation basis for this
2013-04-24 10:12:25	@saimazoon	"when you came by i was having a shower"
2013-04-24 10:12:33	@saimazoon	sen gelince ben dus aliyordum
2013-04-24 10:12:37	@Lysandros	"he olvidado dónde dejé las llaves" I forgot where I put my keys "olvidaba dónde había dejado las llaves" I had forgotten/~was forgetting were I had put the keys [but not anymore]
2013-04-24 10:13:05	@zfe	weird Lysandros
2013-04-24 10:13:11	@zfe	for the second case italian wouldn't use imperfective
2013-04-24 10:13:29	@Lysandros	we can use "había olvidado" in the second case too
2013-04-24 10:13:36	@Lysandros	maybe imperfective is an informal/less correct use
2013-04-24 10:13:45	@zfe	we use the second imperfective
2013-04-24 10:13:45	@saimazoon	I had told you not to go to work = isyerine gitmemeni sana soylemistim
2013-04-24 10:13:48	@zfe	"avevo dimenticato"
2013-04-24 10:15:21	@saimazoon	zfe: mapping turkish tenses to romance ones is fairly smooth in my view
2013-04-24 10:15:27	@saimazoon	it's way harder with other languages, even IE ones
2013-04-24 10:15:28	@saimazoon	like russian
2013-04-24 10:15:30	@zfe	it is not saimazoon
2013-04-24 10:15:31	@saimazoon	which only have two tenses
2013-04-24 10:15:36	<--	Quix0te (~Quix0te@unaffiliated/quix0te) has quit
2013-04-24 10:16:00	@zfe	i had ~1000h teaching itaian to turks by now
2013-04-24 10:16:16	@saimazoon	but you teach plebs, zfe
2013-04-24 10:16:18	@saimazoon	what do you expect
2013-04-24 10:16:29	@zfe	no, i teach to people coming from the best education you can get in this country
2013-04-24 10:16:33	@BadAtom	I thought he taught bored rich brats
2013-04-24 10:17:04	@saimazoon	and you taught yourself turkish using european learning sources
2013-04-24 10:17:04	@saimazoon	the turks you teach are trying to learn your language using sources written in turkish
2013-04-24 10:17:05	@saimazoon	you just can't compare
2013-04-24 10:17:14	@saimazoon	<BadAtom> I thought he taught bored rich brats
2013-04-24 10:17:22	@saimazoon	BadAtom: because that's what he said at some point
2013-04-24 10:17:54	@saimazoon	zfe:
2013-04-24 10:17:58	@saimazoon	imagine a turk learning english
2013-04-24 10:18:03	@saimazoon	fucked up spelling
2013-04-24 10:18:05	@zfe	no, my students are not using turkish resources
2013-04-24 10:18:21	@saimazoon	a host of loan words imported from latin that just don't fit in the overall language feeling
2013-04-24 10:18:38	@saimazoon	turkish is always left-branching, but english places adjectives before words
2013-04-24 10:18:45	@saimazoon	and relative clauses after other nouns
2013-04-24 10:18:50	@saimazoon	does that seem coherent to you?
2013-04-24 10:19:00	@zfe	saimazoon: i'm not accusing turkish of not being coherent
2013-04-24 10:19:25	@zfe	indeed, the language is so coherent that it seems obvious that it was taken from a dialect spoken by people from all around a vast area
2013-04-24 10:19:42	@saimazoon	vast area = istanbul
2013-04-24 10:19:44	@zfe	it seems they patched together the minimum level
2013-04-24 10:19:52	@saimazoon	even the old dialect of ankara sounded closer to azeri
2013-04-24 10:20:02	@saimazoon	they had both q and x
2013-04-24 10:20:03	@zfe	saimazoon: with people getting in from  all around the empire
2013-04-24 10:20:13	@zfe	saimazoon: modern ankara dialect, sivas dialect and such
2013-04-24 10:20:24	@zfe	are closer, if we take the russian loans out, to azeri than to istanbul turkish
2013-04-24 10:20:48	@zfe	if we can call them dialects
2013-04-24 10:21:07	@saimazoon	i'm sure you can understand azer without serious difficulty
2013-04-24 10:21:14	@zfe	spoken no
2013-04-24 10:21:17	@zfe	written yes
2013-04-24 10:21:46	@saimazoon	zfe: removing both the 'q' and 'x' sounds from the spoken standard was a blunder in my opinion
2013-04-24 10:22:00	@saimazoon	because many people in central and eastern turkey still use them
2013-04-24 10:22:05	@zfe	well, x is not exactly removed
2013-04-24 10:22:07	@zfe	even in istanbul dialect
2013-04-24 10:22:16	@saimazoon	and all turkic languages in central asia have them anyway
2013-04-24 10:22:18	@zfe	pay attention to how they say gelmek vs almak
2013-04-24 10:22:28	@zfe	the k in almak is rather an x
2013-04-24 10:22:36	@zfe	ops q
2013-04-24 10:23:08	@saimazoon	when a word has only  front vowels and ends in 'k', that sound is usually palatalised
2013-04-24 10:23:10	@saimazoon	in fact it always is
2013-04-24 10:23:28	@zfe	just like they have two L
2013-04-24 10:23:32	@zfe	and they obviously don't write it
2013-04-24 10:23:52	MrQuist	dru
2013-04-24 10:24:03	@saimazoon	they don't bother doing it because palatalised vs non-palatalised pronunciation isn't phonemic
2013-04-24 10:24:17	@saimazoon	and their occurrence is predictable
2013-04-24 10:24:25	@saimazoon	palatalisation happens in words with front vowels
2013-04-24 10:24:34	@zfe	you should see how hard it is
2013-04-24 10:24:36	@zfe	to remove the back L
2013-04-24 10:24:36	@saimazoon	just as the velarised L occurs in words with back vowels
2013-04-24 10:24:40	@zfe	while they are speaking italian
2013-04-24 10:24:54	@saimazoon	zfe: the english do right the same thing when they speak spanish
2013-04-24 10:25:03	@saimazoon	they can't get rid of the velarised 'l'
2013-04-24 10:25:13	@saimazoon	and if you try to explaion to them what they're doing 'wrong', they just don't understand
2013-04-24 10:25:50	@zfe	i use a section of the palate
2013-04-24 10:25:54	@zfe	to show them what they do
2013-04-24 10:25:57	@zfe	they usually ge it

2013-04-24 10:52:25	@B-rat	was it
2013-04-24 10:52:29	@BadAtom	it was?
2013-04-24 10:53:12	@B-rat	i remember having to upload shit online and then fetch it on the phone's abismal browser
2013-04-24 10:53:14	@msk	yes
2013-04-24 10:53:21	@B-rat	now i just connect it via usb
2013-04-24 10:53:27	@msk	back in the day you could just connect it via usb and transfer files like a normal device
2013-04-24 10:53:39	@B-rat	msk is benjamin button
2013-04-24 10:53:58	@msk	then they invented MTP and ruined everything
2013-04-24 10:54:09	@B-rat	i can still transfer it via USB
2013-04-24 10:54:27	@B-rat	i just needed to install drivers first cause apparently phone manufacturers are too dumb to learn how usb drives normally work
2013-04-24 10:54:33	@Lysandros	my shitty mobile is connected via USB and seen as an external drive if needed
2013-04-24 10:54:46	@B-rat	and i think that's just cause i dont have an sd card
2013-04-24 10:54:59	@msk	my new phone needs an app to transfer files
2013-04-24 10:55:02	@B-rat	the internal memory cant be accessed normally because of safety issues
2013-04-24 10:55:05	@msk	sadly the app doesn't work on os x
2013-04-24 10:55:07	@BadAtom	now you can just transfer via wifi
2013-04-24 10:55:09	@B-rat	you should've gotten a better phone
2013-04-24 10:55:11	@Lysandros	brand?
2013-04-24 10:55:12	@BadAtom	or bluetooth
2013-04-24 10:55:19	@B-rat	you could also just install dropbox on it
2013-04-24 10:55:26	@msk	i tried wifi but it doesn't work either
2013-04-24 10:55:27	@B-rat	or your preferred sync software
2013-04-24 10:55:42	@msk	plus it's ridiculous to have to use wifi when you have physical access to the computer
2013-04-24 10:56:13	@msk	it's also ridiculous to have to transfer files to the cloud and then back
2013-04-24 10:56:17	@msk	esp. when it's music
2013-04-24 10:56:33	@BadAtom	how is that more ridiculous than using wifi when your computer has physical access to your router
2013-04-24 10:56:44	@msk	but it doesn't
2013-04-24 10:56:58	@B-rat	buy a better phone
2013-04-24 10:56:58	@msk	and that'd be ridiculous, yes
2013-04-24 10:57:01	@BadAtom	it's not transferring files to the cloud, it's a LAN connection
2013-04-24 10:57:10	@msk	i meant the dropbox suggestion
2013-04-24 10:57:13	@B-rat	my sister's htc just acted like a usb storage device
2013-04-24 10:57:28	@B-rat	now she's got some kind of weird unbreakable phone, dunno if it works the same with that one or not
2013-04-24 10:57:32	@msk	my old phone was like that as well
2013-04-24 10:57:40	@msk	but no, that was too simple
2013-04-24 10:57:43	@B-rat	xcover or something
2013-04-24 10:57:51	@B-rat	does it have an sd card, msk
2013-04-24 10:57:59	@msk	yes

2013-04-24 10:58:28	@msk	i did but i thought that problem had been solved
2013-04-24 10:58:32	@BadAtom	so why can't you just use USB to transfer files
2013-04-24 10:58:34	@B-rat	hahaha
2013-04-24 10:58:41	@msk	because there's no way to do that

2013-04-24 15:38:47	@neeku	why should something happen to them buying something qfr ?
2013-04-24 15:38:49	@zfe	now i have this doubt
2013-04-24 15:38:52	@zfe	is listerine haram?
2013-04-24 15:38:57	@talib	haha
2013-04-24 15:38:58	@zfe	cause "islamic shops" here don't sell it
2013-04-24 15:38:59	@talib	yes
2013-04-24 15:39:33	@qfr	neeku, because use of tampons is not compatible with leaving the hymen intact
2013-04-24 15:39:39	@neeku	why do you hang out in islamic shops zfe ? :D

2013-04-24 15:40:14	@talib	qfr, you didn't like my jail link? :(
2013-04-24 15:40:30	@neeku	qfr, yes, but nothing special happens if someone walks to store and picks one. also nothing happens if they use them, except that they lose the hymen. but that can have side effects later when they want to marry
2013-04-24 15:40:54	@neeku	i see zfe . jk. :)
2013-04-24 15:41:02	@talib	qfr, they probably just use pads, if that's a concern

2013-04-24 15:42:30	@neeku	so they use pads.

2013-04-24 15:44:52	@zfe	neeku: it's the obvious sign
2013-04-24 15:44:56	@zfe	of the existence of god
2013-04-24 15:45:01	@neeku	(from both theist and atheist aspects)

2013-04-24 15:46:14	@Lysandros	neeku, I believe some theories claim it's a protection against bacteria
2013-04-24 15:46:44	@neeku	hahahaha zfe . it does, with very detailed, step-by-step ones. but that's a religious way of thinking which does not exist on your side of the world. so how would an atheist would explain it?
2013-04-24 15:46:45	@Lysandros	but I don't know how scientific that is
2013-04-24 15:46:47	@neeku	yes hamid

2013-04-24 15:47:23	@qfr	I'm not sure there's consensus on the evolutionary significance of the human hymen

2013-04-24 15:47:31	@qfr	Apparently we're the only mammal that has it
2013-04-24 15:47:43	@zfe	why people misunderstand evolutionism so much?
2013-04-24 15:47:46	@Lysandros	zfe, it would protect BEFORE having sex, obviously, but I don't know, really, it's just something I remember reading a while ago

2013-04-24 15:47:55	@Lysandros	maybe it was on 4chan and I don't remember the details

2013-04-24 15:48:54	@qfr	They only have it in fetuses

2013-04-24 16:01:03	@neeku	because here's an islamic country with an islamic government

2013-04-24 16:10:55	@neeku	if a couple want to get diverced during engagement, if the woman has the hymen, she gets half the money from the man, and the man's name is removed from the woman's birth certificate to prove that she's never married!

2013-04-24 16:12:40	@talib	if the woman doesn't have the hymen, she gets stoned to death.
2013-04-24 16:12:52	@neeku	that's why having sex even during marriage is not allowed!
2013-04-24 16:13:05	@Clint	hooray for marriage
2013-04-24 16:13:21	@talib	neeku, do women smuggle dildoes into the country?
2013-04-24 16:13:44	@neeku	no talib but the man has the right to divorce her just because she does not have the hymen, which can be lost during some accident, but not even sex!

2013-04-24 17:37:15	bogdan	qfr, the rate of mutation is pretty much the same.
2013-04-24 17:37:49	bogdan	qfr, which is how they can tell when HIV started infecting humans (decades before AIDS being noticed).
2013-04-24 17:38:02	@qfr	bogdan, Wikipedia says y chromosomes have a far higher rate of mutation than the other human chromosomes
2013-04-24 17:39:17	bogdan	qfr, it talks about the total mutation rate, not that due to background radiation.
2013-04-24 17:39:38	@qfr	Isn't mutation to radiation very rare
2013-04-24 17:39:43	@qfr	I thought it was mostly errors during copying

2013-04-24 17:42:35	@qfr	So with y haplogroups it's basically just small markers that somehow survived the faulty process

2013-04-25 06:13:17	@lingbot	soft cock: A person, usually a man, who lacks strength of character, or who is an easy touch for a sob story, or who cannot be relied on to take decisive action. Usually a sycophant.

2013-04-25 07:52:33	@Spaceghost	Well, maybe that sensation I had when I was reading Demian, maybe ever the end was bad in comparision to its plot.

2013-04-25 07:54:24	@Spaceghost	In Spanish, why the question?
2013-04-25 07:54:49	@BadAtom	just curious, because Hesse is usually considered advanced reading
2013-04-25 07:55:51	@Spaceghost	Being German I didn't find much sense reading it at English but also I never read a serious book in English, I would like try with Orwell.

2013-04-25 09:57:47	@msk	they don't have a masculine and a feminine
2013-04-25 09:58:21	@msk	haha
2013-04-25 09:58:21	@msk	A subtler strategy of gender-neutralizing pronouns is the replacement of man (which means either man or one, as in: One ought to gender-neutralize pronouns) with en (which, literally translated, means one). Fact is that en is already used in some dialects and contexts as a replacement for man and some native speakers of Swedish would thus consider the word as belonging to regional or low-prestige

2013-04-25 10:02:36	@msk	According to the PCIG proposal, Spanish and Portuguese speakers can pronounce the at-sign using the phoneme /ɔ/ and the ligature with /ɛ/.
2013-04-25 10:02:39	@msk	oh dear
2013-04-25 10:02:50	@msk	However, some Spanish speakers are concerned that this proposal is unlikely to be adopted, since the Spanish language does not distinguish /ɔ/ and /ɛ/ from /o/ and /e/ respectively, and most of its speakers would therefore not even notice a difference in pronunciation.
2013-04-25 10:03:15	@msk	that'd be hard to do in portuguese as well
2013-04-25 10:03:28	@msk	[O] is something we only do in stressed syllables
2013-04-25 10:03:54	@msk	The phoneme [ɔ] is between the [a] characteristic of feminine nouns and the [o] characteristic of masculine nouns in the scale of vowel height, which can be characterized symbolic of gender inclusion. Analogously, the "gender-inclusive" [ɛ] is intermediate step between the "feminine" [a] and the "masculine" [e].

2013-04-25 10:09:11	@BadAtom	"One part of bringing hen into the Swedish language is by publishing a gender neutral book for children. It’s called “Kivi och monsterhund” (Kivi and monster dog) and is written by Jesper Lundqvist. It’s filled with hens, mappor (Mother = mamma, Father = pappa) morbroster (Uncle = morbror, Aunt = moster)  and bröstrar (Brothers = bröder, Sisters = systrar)."

2013-04-25 10:14:18	@msk	there's also Gebrüder which apparently isn't used anymore
2013-04-25 10:14:54	@BadAtom	ge + schwester, to form an aggregate noun
2013-04-25 10:15:29	@msk	what's up with ge
2013-04-25 10:15:48	@BadAtom	the scandinavian languages have something similar, swedish syskon and icelandic systkin, sister-kin
2013-04-25 10:20:25	@B-rat	So instead we might say, "Every child has their monkey," even though it's not grammatically correct.

2013-04-25 10:26:59	@B-rat	Yoette - A young black female. Unlike "yo", the term doesn't refer to the individuals as criminals. Not very gender neutral.
2013-04-25 10:28:12	@B-rat	"As far as the whole 'yo'-option is concerned, from the clips played, the kids sounded a lot more like they were speaking a dialect of 'Smurf' with 'Smurf' replaced with 'yo' rather than specifically addressing the pronoun issues English had (in the past)."

2013-04-25 11:37:11	@msk	There is no reason other than massive taxation of more than 50 percent and consumer naivete that thinks paying the sticker price of a BMW X5 is the same value as buying a Cherokee.  Sorry, Brazukas…there is no status in a Toyota Corolla, Honda Civic, Jeep Grand or Dodge Durango. Don’t be fooled by the sticker price. You’re definitely getting ripped off.

FSI would be "start out with 3 sets of 10 reps at X pounds three times per week, and run Y miles per day."

2013-04-25 14:45:21	@B-rat	if a company only sells some phones with a contract (at least as advertised on their site), can you still buy them without one and pay the full price
2013-04-25 14:45:24	@B-rat	i'm assuming you probably can
2013-04-25 14:45:35	@talib	yes
2013-04-25 14:45:37	@talib	of course
2013-04-25 14:45:44	@talib	you can buy the phone outright
2013-04-25 14:46:15	@B-rat	i dont know why the manufacturers dont just sell the phones themselves
2013-04-25 14:46:23	@B-rat	all this contract business is confusing
2013-04-25 14:48:04	@B-rat	msk, did you get a new phone when you got there or what
2013-04-25 14:48:17	@msk	no, i got it a few weeks ago
2013-04-25 14:48:34	@B-rat	what did you do before then
2013-04-25 14:48:52	@msk	i already had a phone
2013-04-25 14:48:54	@B-rat	use your phone from brazil, how did the carrier fees etc affect you across continents
2013-04-25 14:49:08	@msk	i bought a sim card and put it in my phone
2013-04-25 14:49:20	@B-rat	so like a prepaid thing
2013-04-25 14:49:21	@no-n	http://eatliveburp.net/2012/12/28/masala-coke/
2013-04-25 14:49:23	@msk	i have a contract now but it's not tied to the phone
2013-04-25 14:50:03	@B-rat	some phones are apparently locked as far as network providers go
2013-04-25 14:50:14	@B-rat	that seems like a silly idea
2013-04-25 14:50:14	@msk	yes
2013-04-25 14:50:15	@msk	it's not a silly idea
2013-04-25 14:50:21	@msk	it allows them to sell phones for $1
2013-04-25 14:50:25	@B-rat	mine isnt afaik, when i was in italy and croatia it just told me i was on a vodafone partner network
2013-04-25 14:50:38	@msk	that's not what being locked means
2013-04-25 14:50:39	@B-rat	and my fee was like, not a whole lot different than normal
2013-04-25 14:50:42	@B-rat	well
2013-04-25 14:50:47	@msk	being locked means that if you put a different sim card it won't work
2013-04-25 14:50:47	@B-rat	if there werent a vodafone partner there
2013-04-25 14:50:55	@B-rat	oh
2013-04-25 14:50:58	@B-rat	wot
2013-04-25 14:51:11	@B-rat	but it doesnt come with a sim card when you buy it
2013-04-25 14:51:16	@B-rat	or does it
2013-04-25 14:51:30	@msk	it does if you buy it in these crazy $1 deals
2013-04-25 14:51:33	@B-rat	or are sim cards vendor locked or something
2013-04-25 14:51:39	@B-rat	i bought my phone for 1€
2013-04-25 14:51:41	@talib	B-rat, yeah, network locking does occur
2013-04-25 14:51:46	@B-rat	i'm using my... 10 year old? sim card
2013-04-25 14:52:04	@msk	they don't come vendor-locked but the phone company can do that
2013-04-25 14:52:06	@B-rat	this is all so ridiculous, talib
2013-04-25 14:52:22	@B-rat	phones should be separate from sims and that should be separate from network providers
2013-04-25 14:52:23	@talib	B-rat, just buy the phone outright, then you can use it with any network
2013-04-25 14:52:24	@B-rat	like, completely
2013-04-25 14:52:29	@B-rat	yeah
2013-04-25 14:52:36	@talib	that's what i've always done
2013-04-25 14:52:39	@B-rat	bit expensive but worth it
2013-04-25 14:52:43	@talib	fuck being locked to contracts
2013-04-25 14:52:55	@msk	i don't know what the status of this is in brazil now, i think it's illegal
2013-04-25 14:53:05	@msk	before that they were allowed to lock it for 1 year
2013-04-25 14:55:00	@msk	it should've been illegal all along anyway
2013-04-25 14:55:06	@msk	since product tying is illegal
2013-04-25 14:56:07	@B-rat	hmm optus doesnt give you an option on their site for buying the phone outright if it's one that comes with a plan
2013-04-25 14:56:15	@talib	fuck optus
2013-04-25 14:56:31	@talib	unless you're certain you want them

2013-04-25 17:17:23	Bogdan_	but somehow, Montenegro is outside of it.
2013-04-25 17:18:08	@zocky	Bogdan_, maybe slovenia too, so maybe it's "western balkans" with albania and montenegro treated as italian provinces

2013-04-25 17:20:08	@B-rat	Speed, i heard the only gay bar in ljubljana has plenty of fights all the time because some people are apparently huge douchebags
2013-04-25 17:20:16	@B-rat	and that one time someone threw a brick through a window or something

2013-04-25 17:21:18	@zocky	B-rat, yeah, but the bar is a more common target than individual gay people

2013-04-25 21:29:39	@msk	Die "New York Daily News" folgerte sogleich, Paltrow sei "commando" unterwegs - eine englische Umschreibung für fehlende Unterwäsche. Das Boulevardblatt scheint derzeit ohnehin mit der Schauspielerin auf Kriegsfuß zu stehen. Auf ihre Wahl zum schönsten Menschen reagierte die Zeitung mit einer eigenen bitterbösen Liste: "Fünf Gründe, warum Gwyneth Paltrow nicht die schönste Frau der Welt
2013-04-25 21:29:39	@kehoea	»Der Name ist keltischer Herkunft. Er setzt sich zusammen aus gwyn ‚weiß, schön‘ und dolen ‚Bogen, Kreis‘. Gwendolin ist ein in walisischen Sagen beliebter Name von Frauen und Feen. Der Bestandteil dolin kann im Walisischen auch mit ‚Blume‘ übersetzt werden, der Name würde dann ‚weiße Blume‘ oder auch ‚schöne Blume‘ bedeuten, was in Zusammenhang mit der Feennamensgebung einen tieferen Sinn ergibt.«

2013-04-25 21:42:59	@pwca	my impression is that most people who build muscle do so to compensate for something.
2013-04-25 21:43:21	@pwca	either they've no personality and build muscle to have some defining characteristic.
2013-04-25 21:43:30	@pwca	or they were picked on as a child.
2013-04-25 21:43:40	@pwca	or they're really terrified of other people.
2013-04-25 21:43:41	@msk	that's a terrible excuse not to build muscle

2013-04-30 14:46:11	@qfr	Gennadius, he previously hinted that he resides in Berlin
2013-04-30 14:46:36	Gennadius	i've been on irc before, but i'm feeling a bit conversation-starved atm, so i thought i would check out the linguistics channel.
2013-04-30 14:47:08	@qfr	However, he joined just a few minutes ago and is being unnecessarily secretive about his identity, we still suspect that he might be a regular or a banned troll in disguise

2013-04-30 14:48:38	@msk	and yeah i think he's unlikely to be new

2013-04-30 14:51:43	Gennadius	saying fundie politics isn't quite fair. the pro-life movement in the united states is still largely catholic-dominated, and catholics aren't 'fundamentalists.'
2013-04-30 14:52:28	Gennadius	but the israel stuff definitely is fundie politics
2013-04-30 14:52:42	@Lysandros	I suppose it would be feasible to write a program that analyzes one's preferred lexicon&grammar, spelling.. to identify people coming with different names

2013-04-30 14:56:46	@Lysandros	"true" catholicism is quite harsh, but I don't think the number of catholics that really stick to the official doctrine is that high
2013-04-30 14:56:51	DrHasselbacher	I've been reading a lot of Graham Greene lately

2013-04-30 14:58:13	@Lysandros	qfr, surprisingly, they concluded the bible wasn't written by a pidgeon
2013-04-30 14:58:13	@qfr	The two novels I mentioned or the Abrahamic scripture
2013-04-30 14:58:27	@qfr	Lysandros, 2/10 would not read again
2013-04-30 14:58:32	DrHasselbacher	the Quran is worthless, however, without the book of interpretations

2013-04-30 14:59:07	DrHasselbacher	qfr, I haven't read the two novels you mentioned
2013-04-30 14:59:44	Gennadius	i'd be interested in that, qfr. the famous german biblical scholar julius wellhausen claimed that the pentateuch was assembled from various different sources basically copy-and-pasted together. he identified trends based in the words they used for "god" (and other criteria)---there is an "elohist" source, a "yahwist" source, etc.
2013-04-30 15:00:00	@qfr	Yes, the documentary hypothesis or whatever it's called
2013-04-30 15:00:04	@qfr	I'm familiar with it
2013-04-30 15:00:04	Gennadius	right
2013-04-30 15:00:07	@qfr	It's widely accepted now anyways
2013-04-30 15:00:18	Gennadius	so if it holds true, maybe you'd see statistical differences. i would be stunned if someone hasn't done that
2013-04-30 15:00:31	@qfr	Many have, I'm certain
2013-04-30 15:00:36	DrHasselbacher	the bible incorporates many legends from different sources as well
2013-04-30 15:00:59	DrHasselbacher	it
2013-04-30 15:01:31	@Lysandros	yeah, can't say the holy ghost was very original whispering stories
2013-04-30 15:01:33	@qfr	The Hebrew sources are based on religious traditions derived from a new monotheistic movement among the Canaanites and also from Mesopotamian and Egyptian lore
2013-04-30 15:01:42	DrHasselbacher	I recommend The Quiet American, Our Man in Havana and The Power and the Glory by Graham Greene
2013-04-30 15:02:04	@qfr	And the New Testament hm
2013-04-30 15:02:35	@qfr	I'm not sure it added anything new in terms of cultural sources
2013-04-30 15:02:58	@qfr	It is often suggested taht some of the authors of the New Testament explained Judaist concepts to gentiles
2013-04-30 15:03:02	@qfr	In great detail
2013-04-30 15:03:35	@qfr	So that was the most novel thing in that regard I suppose
2013-04-30 15:03:55	@qfr	But like it didn't draw from Hellenic culture that I'd be aware of it
2013-04-30 15:04:05	@qfr	Even though early Christianity was heavily connected to Hellenised Jewry

2013-04-30 15:04:49	DrHasselbacher	the BBC radio's composer of the week is Meyerbeer. I consider this an outright provocation so close to Wagner's 200th birthday.
2013-04-30 15:05:17	@qfr	Have you read Der Fall Wagner
2013-04-30 15:05:33	DrHasselbacher	he's not a clinical patient
2013-04-30 15:05:44	DrHasselbacher	there is no case
2013-04-30 15:06:01	@qfr	?
2013-04-30 15:06:06	@qfr	It's a book by Nietzsche
2013-04-30 15:06:18	Gennadius	think it is a deliberate move, DrHasselbacher? pick a jewish composer instead of wagner?
2013-04-30 15:06:20	DrHasselbacher	yes, Nietzsche was wrong about Wagner at the end
2013-04-30 15:06:25	DrHasselbacher	Gennadius, it might be

2013-04-30 15:07:56	DrHasselbacher	the Israeli state much like a totalitarian state does not want public perfomances of Wagner
2013-04-30 15:08:39	@qfr	One of the most fucked up things I've heard about Israel is that Jews are not permitted to marry gentiles
2013-04-30 15:08:58	DrHasselbacher	it is quite silly if one considers that Wagner was only a private idiosyncrasy of Herr Hitler
2013-04-30 15:09:00	@Lysandros	surely he was antisemitic but I don't see what it has to do with music
2013-04-30 15:09:06	@qfr	Apparently mixed couples usually deal with this by goiing into one of the neighbouring countries, they get married there and then get it recognised at home in Israel
2013-04-30 15:09:12	@Lysandros	hell, if hitler had had any artistic talent I would acknowledge it too
2013-04-30 15:09:23	@Lysandros	wagner's music is just amazing
2013-04-30 15:09:27	DrHasselbacher	Lysandros, it's not because Wagner was an anti-Semite
2013-04-30 15:09:31	@qfr	His paintings were decent
2013-04-30 15:09:40	@qfr	I mean they weren't creative in any way
2013-04-30 15:09:42	DrHasselbacher	it's because of Hitler
2013-04-30 15:09:52	@qfr	But he did a decent job at painting realistically
2013-04-30 15:10:28	@Lysandros	DrHasselbacher, I think that just made his antisemitism more patent (nothing like hitler's endorsement to do that) but it might have been the case anyway
2013-04-30 15:10:59	@qfr	Giving shit to Wagner is more legit than giving shit to Nietzsche in the context of national socialism, anyways
2013-04-30 15:11:07	DrHasselbacher	however, Wagner was not a consistent anti-Semite, in his works he contradicts this more than once
2013-04-30 15:11:45	DrHasselbacher	also the first guy to conduct his Parsifal opera was Hermann Levi, a Jew whom he protected against anti-Semitic outrage that he was to conduct his opera
2013-04-30 15:12:11	@qfr	I think DrHasselbacher is legimitately new
2013-04-30 15:12:12	@Lysandros	I don't know what he said exactly, I remember reading something about him believin jews had no musical talent or something along the lines
2013-04-30 15:12:21	@qfr	I've never encountered any traits like this
2013-04-30 15:12:23	@Lysandros	which made me lol a bit

2013-04-30 15:21:14	@qfr	So many people were alienated by their move
2013-04-30 15:21:42	@qfr	Implementing Yiddish as the language of Israel would have been met with far less resistance by the general population
2013-04-30 15:21:45	DrHasselbacher	Israeli musicians want to play Wagner. This is not well known. But Barenboim was invited to play Wagner, he did not want to provoke.

2013-04-30 15:22:32	Gennadius	stalin founded it: jewish autonomous oblast in siberia. he conceived it as a rival soviet project to zionism
2013-04-30 15:22:37	@qfr	And curiously enough the standard Israeli accent is basically Hebrew mispronounced by Germans
2013-04-30 15:22:46	@qfr	They use filthy Ashkenazi pronunciation
2013-04-30 15:23:15	Gennadius	i wouldn't call it filthy. and they use more than just askhenazic pronunciation. some grammatical structures as well.
2013-04-30 15:23:58	Gennadius	and some other linguistic behaviors that skirt pragmatics and grammar
2013-04-30 15:24:02	Gennadius	for example, shm-reduplication
2013-04-30 15:24:16	@qfr	Not familiar with that one
2013-04-30 15:24:33	Gennadius	it is a structure from yiddish---a way of mocking something. it is now found in american english and israeli hebrew

2013-04-30 15:27:12	@qfr	Never heard
2013-04-30 15:27:32	@qfr	I presumed it was something that originated as a creole language among Jews around Germany/Poland
2013-04-30 15:28:30	@Bucketphase	a floating menorah taught the language to someone in a dream
2013-04-30 15:28:30	Gennadius	according to him, judaized west-slavs (closely related to sorbs) 'relexified' (he uses the term a bit differently from what is meant in the field of creolistics) their language to high german vocabulary.
2013-04-30 15:28:48	@Bucketphase	that's a good tune Lysandros

2013-04-30 15:37:13	Gennadius	interesting, saimazoon. so would you say that basque has influenced castilian as a substrate, or through contact?
2013-04-30 15:37:15	@saimazoon	of 's' and 'ts'
2013-04-30 15:37:26	@qfr	And that type of s vs. z contrast is very non-Indo-Euroean I think

2013-04-30 15:54:07	@saimazoon	i speak persian
2013-04-30 15:54:09	@saimazoon	modern tehrani persian
2013-04-30 15:54:12	Gennadius	cool
2013-04-30 15:54:23	Gennadius	have you lived there, or did you study it on your own or at university?
2013-04-30 15:54:28	@saimazoon	at university
2013-04-30 15:54:35	@saimazoon	extracurricular courses
2013-04-30 15:54:45	@saimazoon	it wasn't part of my degree
2013-04-30 15:55:00	Gennadius	a friend of mine did that as well actually
2013-04-30 15:55:04	<--	hamid (~nithp@unaffiliated/hamid) has quit (Quit: Lost terminal)
2013-04-30 15:55:08	@saimazoon	persian is easy
2013-04-30 15:55:10	Gennadius	but i decided to take sanskrit electives instead
2013-04-30 15:55:10	@qfr	saimazoon obsessively learns random new languages and lives abroad, as a form of procrastination
2013-04-30 15:55:10	@Lysandros	saimazoon, te suena el dicho "beati hispani, quibus bibere vivere est"?
2013-04-30 15:55:23	@Lysandros	se dice que ya los romanos se mofaban de nuestra b/v
2013-04-30 15:55:32	@qfr	lol
2013-04-30 15:55:33	Gennadius	better than most forms of procrastination, qfr
2013-04-30 15:55:38	@saimazoon	other than the convoluted writing system and its thousand glitches and redundancies, the language itself doesn't pose much of a challange to western europeans
2013-04-30 15:55:57	Gennadius	i like that quote, Lysandros. who said that, erasmus?>
2013-04-30 15:56:08	@saimazoon	Lysandros: probablemente sea por el sustrato lingüístico vasco-íbero con el que se toparon
2013-04-30 15:56:27	@Lysandros	supposedly dates back frmo the roman empire, although I think it might be more recent
2013-04-30 15:56:47	@Lysandros	I said that it is said romans already mocked our null distinction between b and v sounds back then
2013-04-30 15:56:48	Gennadius	i know that erasmus made fun of the spanish pronunciation of 'vivit' as 'bibit' although i can't remember where
2013-04-30 15:57:19	@Lysandros	I don't know if it's true thought, it's just something I was told years ago
2013-04-30 15:57:23	@Lysandros	though*
2013-04-30 15:57:45	@saimazoon	Lysandros: en portugués hay distinción entre v/b
2013-04-30 15:57:48	@saimazoon	y en occitano también
2013-04-30 15:57:52	@saimazoon	y en catalán también la había
2013-04-30 15:58:01	@saimazoon	de hecho, creo que se perdió en catalán y gallego por la influencia del castellano
2013-04-30 15:58:14	Gennadius	did you hear the one about eriugena?
2013-04-30 15:58:55	Gennadius	he was seated before king charles the bald, who asked him "Quid distat inter sottum et Scottum? "
2013-04-30 15:59:01	Gennadius	his answer: "Mensa tantum."
2013-04-30 15:59:29	@Lysandros	me llaman
2013-04-30 15:59:46	@McqfrTheScott	Cassowaries, Fins don actulally make spelling errors beyond typos rigt?
2013-04-30 15:59:57	@McqfrTheScott	In Finnish that is.
2013-04-30 16:00:16	@qfr	??
2013-04-30 16:00:32	Gennadius	convoluted english spelling is actually a great thing. it helps  us separate the wheat from the chaff
2013-04-30 16:00:41	@qfr	 It sucks
2013-04-30 16:00:42	Gennadius	you can glance at something and realize it isn't worth reading
2013-04-30 16:00:47	@saimazoon	qfr: so uneducated turks in germany seem to work vowel harmony rules out when speaking german_
2013-04-30 16:00:57	@qfr	yes, to some extent
2013-04-30 16:00:58	@saimazoon	that's so fun
2013-04-30 16:01:10	@qfr	saimazoon, but many of them don't speak proper Turkish either
2013-04-30 16:01:23	@saimazoon	they don't need it
2013-04-30 16:01:28	Gennadius	there were some armenian dialects in turkey that borrowed the turkish system of vowel harmony
2013-04-30 16:01:31	@saimazoon	the kind of job positions they fill don't require them to speak any language at all
2013-04-30 16:01:36	@qfr	:D
2013-04-30 16:01:43	Gennadius	but they're mostly extinct now
2013-04-30 16:01:50	@saimazoon	qfr: what's the deal with that trial about to begin in germany
2013-04-30 16:02:05	@saimazoon	the pimmelord who murdered eight turks and a greek national over the last ten years
2013-04-30 16:02:29	@saimazoon	they've even invited turkish press to cover the trial in a german courthouse
2013-04-30 16:02:48	@qfr	I only heard about it a few days ago
2013-04-30 16:02:55	Gennadius	i was in germany during one of those murders
2013-04-30 16:03:22	 *	vlt too
2013-04-30 16:03:38	@qfr	Who is vlt
2013-04-30 16:03:46	Gennadius	i had a student fellowship at a research library, i enjoyed my time there
2013-04-30 16:03:57	@qfr	vlt are they getting read of the whole split highschool system yet?
2013-04-30 16:03:59	@qfr	Err
2013-04-30 16:04:05	@qfr	fucking hell
2013-04-30 16:04:06	@qfr	rid*
2013-04-30 16:04:30	@vlt	qfr: No, not yet.
2013-04-30 16:04:38	@qfr	But is it in the works?
2013-04-30 16:04:43	@qfr	Or do they plan on keeping it
2013-04-30 16:04:48	@vlt	They try in some areas.
2013-04-30 16:04:56	@qfr	Is the proposal met with resistance from the right?
2013-04-30 16:05:24	@qfr	I wonder how the FDP voted on that one
2013-04-30 16:05:27	@vlt	I don’t know whether the resistance is _only_ from the right.
2013-04-30 16:06:05	Gennadius	is it actually a bad system? i grew up in an economically depressed rural area in the united states, and i would have loved a two-tier system.
2013-04-30 16:06:27	Gennadius	if only to get me away from meth addicts and other lowlife sorts
2013-04-30 16:06:27	@qfr	Gennadius, I think it might reduce social mobility
2013-04-30 16:06:49	@saimazoon	qfr: how do you voice the german 'r'
2013-04-30 16:06:57	@saimazoon	uvular fricative, velar fricative or uvular trill?
2013-04-30 16:06:58	@qfr	Voice?
2013-04-30 16:07:02	@saimazoon	i can't manage the uvular trill myself
2013-04-30 16:07:03	@qfr	You mean pronounce
2013-04-30 16:07:05	@saimazoon	how do you realise it
2013-04-30 16:07:05	@saimazoon	yeah
2013-04-30 16:07:14	Gennadius	does persian have the uvular trill, saimazoon?
2013-04-30 16:07:17	@qfr	I have 3 phones for it, I think
2013-04-30 16:07:20	@saimazoon	no, Gennadius
2013-04-30 16:07:31	@saimazoon	uvular plosive though
2013-04-30 16:07:32	Gennadius	what is the first letter in "Reza" pronounced like?
2013-04-30 16:07:56	@saimazoon	'r' is an alveolar flap
2013-04-30 16:07:58	<--	Parsi1 (~Adium@217.218.232.13) has quit (Quit: Leaving.)
2013-04-30 16:08:05	@saimazoon	or dental flap, depending on the dialect
2013-04-30 16:08:09	@saimazoon	or even an alveolar trill
2013-04-30 16:08:16	@saimazoon	double 'rr' sounds like a trill
2013-04-30 16:08:30	@qfr	I think I almost exclusively use either a uvular fricative or a uvular approximant thing
2013-04-30 16:08:45	@McqfrTheScott	saimazoon, how do you say in Persian 'I will no longer stand as your brother'?
2013-04-30 16:08:48	@qfr	The trill uhm never really
2013-04-30 16:09:15	@saimazoon	من دیگر برادرتان نخواهم بود
2013-04-30 16:09:27	@qfr	Have fun figuring out the vowels on that one
2013-04-30 16:09:28	@qfr	lol.
2013-04-30 16:09:50	Gennadius	i see long vowels at least
2013-04-30 16:09:56	Gennadius	not sure about the short ones
2013-04-30 16:09:57	@McqfrTheScott	saimazoon, transliterate.
2013-04-30 16:10:08	@saimazoon	man digar baraadaretaan naxaaham bud
2013-04-30 16:10:13	@qfr	Persian does not fully encode vowels and it's ambiguous
2013-04-30 16:10:19	@saimazoon	yeah
2013-04-30 16:10:21	@qfr	Sometimes you need context
2013-04-30 16:10:21	@saimazoon	کس
2013-04-30 16:10:24	@qfr	Do tell what it says
2013-04-30 16:10:28	@qfr	To*
2013-04-30 16:10:31	@saimazoon	that can be pronounced either as "kas" or "kos"
2013-04-30 16:10:37	@saimazoon	"kas" means "person" or "somebody"
2013-04-30 16:10:41	@saimazoon	but kos is vagina
2013-04-30 16:10:43	@saimazoon	cunt
2013-04-30 16:10:54	@qfr	I thought that was kus
2013-04-30 16:10:55	@qfr	lol
2013-04-30 16:10:58	@saimazoon	no, it's kos
2013-04-30 16:11:42	@saimazoon	qfr: who does the uvular trill then
2013-04-30 16:11:52	@saimazoon	almost all recordings i listen to these days use the uvular trill
2013-04-30 16:11:56	-->	DrHasselbacher (DrHasselba@195.80.218.41) has joined #linguistics
2013-04-30 16:12:01	@saimazoon	for syllable-onset 'r'
2013-04-30 16:12:33	@saimazoon	after all you're not a representatve sample of the german-speaking population
2013-04-30 16:12:37	Gennadius	i think it varies regionally in german, maybe it varies with sociolect
2013-04-30 16:12:38	 *	DrHasselbacher is listening to the Meistersinger opera (the Karl Böhm record)
2013-04-30 16:12:44	@qfr	saimazoon,  maybe in slower speech
2013-04-30 16:12:51	@saimazoon	you're not a representative sample of anything that's got to do with mankind as a whole
2013-04-30 16:12:53	Gennadius	i also know there is a special pronunciation in singing chorale music
2013-04-30 16:13:26	Gennadius	DrHasselbacher could probably tell us precisely where the uvular trill is used
2013-04-30 16:13:29	@qfr	Of course it varies regionally, some don't even have uvulars
2013-04-30 16:13:29	@saimazoon	are you new here, Gennadius
2013-04-30 16:13:31	@qfr	Like Austro-Bavarian
2013-04-30 16:13:39	Gennadius	yes, i'm new here, saimazoon
2013-04-30 16:13:43	@saimazoon	welcome
2013-04-30 16:14:07	Gennadius	thank you, this seems like a good place for intelligent conversation
2013-04-30 16:14:23	DrHasselbacher	Gennadius, are you making fun of my German accent?
2013-04-30 16:14:42	Gennadius	no, i mean to say that you are probably more acutely aware of german dialectal differences than most people here
2013-04-30 16:14:56	DrHasselbacher	really?
2013-04-30 16:14:58	@qfr	Gennadius, you will change your mind once this channel changes back to its original state
2013-04-30 16:15:30	Gennadius	you mean it changes from #linguistics to #monstertrucks ?
2013-04-30 16:15:32	DrHasselbacher	there'll never be a Furtwängler again

2013-04-30 16:15:53	DrHasselbacher	wonderful tempo
2013-04-30 16:16:02	@qfr	What do we even usually talk about in here
2013-04-30 16:16:40	Gennadius	this is very pleasant. so pleasant i don't even notice the swastika. :)
2013-04-30 16:16:44	DrHasselbacher	what does one usually talk about? the opera, literature, politics...
2013-04-30 16:17:37	@qfr	Gennadius, http://siyobik.info.gf/misc/black-white-red/denny-crane.jpg
2013-04-30 16:17:39	@qfr	That was from earlier toda
2013-04-30 16:17:41	@qfr	today*
2013-04-30 16:17:45	@Cassowaries	McqfrTheScott, well, define 'error'; lots of people use nonstandard forms, but that usually has a plausible dialectal cause, so it's hard for me to say whether any particular error is wrong for any given lect, if you follow
2013-04-30 16:17:46	@qfr	And indeed, it does feature a tiny swastika

2013-04-30 16:18:03	@Cassowaries	and I'm not even talking about colloquialisms per se
2013-04-30 16:18:08	@McqfrTheScott	Cassowaries, yeah
2013-04-30 16:18:15	Gennadius	who wrote that, qfr ? judging by the writing of the date at the bottom, it was written by a german ?
2013-04-30 16:18:25	@iLogical	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dz2EsDhioo
2013-04-30 16:18:28	@Cassowaries	dun dun dunnn
2013-04-30 16:18:29	Gennadius	the style of both the '1' and the '9' look very german
2013-04-30 16:18:31	@McqfrTheScott	Cassowaries, are there a lot of Finns who can't speak Kirjakieli?
2013-04-30 16:18:33	@qfr	It was I
2013-04-30 16:18:33	@Cassowaries	you divined qfr's secret identity
2013-04-30 16:18:37	@qfr	Cassowaries, haha
2013-04-30 16:18:59	@Cassowaries	McqfrTheScott, I doubt it, but there are lots who won't, I'm sure
2013-04-30 16:19:03	@qfr	Gennadius, I wasn't aware they were common for Germany, the only difference I notice is UK/US 1/9
2013-04-30 16:19:08	@qfr	But like Germany vs. Poland nope
2013-04-30 16:19:25	Gennadius	yes, there are handwriting differences for numerals
2013-04-30 16:20:44	@Cassowaries	yeah, that degree of curvature on a "9" is pretty unanglophone, for example
2013-04-30 16:21:00	@qfr	http://img34.imageshack.us/img34/896/nmeros.gif
2013-04-30 16:21:02	@qfr	That's French
2013-04-30 16:21:10	@qfr	Looks just like what I was used to in Germany
2013-04-30 16:21:16	@qfr	Except the _ on the 1
2013-04-30 16:21:19	@qfr	That's rare in general
2013-04-30 16:21:23	@qfr	Although I have seen some people in Germany do it
2013-04-30 16:21:30	@qfr	But only women

2013-04-30 16:22:27	@Cassowaries	I have only two differences from that - my 9 has a straight descender and my 2 is looped at the bottom
2013-04-30 16:22:43	@qfr	So yeah there's no difference between Germany and other European countries in that regard afaik
2013-04-30 16:22:46	@Cassowaries	(and I write 1 as a bare line in some contexts)
2013-04-30 16:22:48	@qfr	With the exception of the UK
2013-04-30 16:23:00	Gennadius	this is a common handwritten form for the number '4' among french people

2013-04-30 16:23:26	@qfr	Never seen that style before

2013-04-30 16:24:42	Gennadius	in general though i think that writing on the continent is more similar and unified, and the main difference is between us/uk and continental europe
2013-04-30 16:24:43	@Bucketphase	i do 7 with a cross
2013-04-30 16:24:44	@qfr	1/7/9 are the big differencees
2013-04-30 16:24:49	@Bucketphase	and i do 1 like a lambda
2013-04-30 16:24:50	@Cassowaries	I also do it with a cross
2013-04-30 16:24:54	@qfr	Bucketphase, that's just because you're a theist
2013-04-30 16:25:00	@Bucketphase	true
2013-04-30 16:25:02	Gennadius	what kind of theist, Bucketphase?

2013-05-01 05:29:52	@Clint	oh, there are no people here
2013-05-01 05:30:34	@saimazoon	McqfrTheScott: no, but he shouldn't be pushed to accept legal responsibility over the soon-to-be-born child
2013-05-01 05:31:02	@saimazoon	children belong to their mothers, because they bear them for nine months and take the hassle to spit them out of their cunts
2013-05-01 05:31:37	@saimazoon	that's a painful experience which leaves unfixable traces on their bodies for the rest of their lives
2013-05-01 05:32:02	@saimazoon	as a man, you just vow to accept legal responsibility over a child, but i think whom the semen that inseminated her came from is pretty much irrelevant
2013-05-01 05:32:52	@McqfrTheScott	saimazoon, well if that is the case, you can argue that hospitals can swap babies around freely.
2013-05-01 05:33:20	@McqfrTheScott	As in, you deliver, you give it to them for check and they might as well give you another one back as long as they give you one back for every one you give to them as check
2013-05-01 05:33:37	@saimazoon	i'd understand you might feel disgruntled if that woman carried on with pregnancy and after the child was born requested you to pay her child support
2013-05-01 05:33:52	@McqfrTheScott	Well, personally I wouldn't care much honestly
2013-05-01 05:34:24	@McqfrTheScott	But the issue is in this case that I feel this case should be construed completely in favour of the wishes of the man simply beause the woman took active steps to get into this situation
2013-05-01 05:34:28	@saimazoon	that's ok, McqfrTheScott
2013-05-01 05:34:40	@saimazoon	i don't hold maternal feelings, so the question stands irrelevant to me
2013-05-01 05:34:42	@McqfrTheScott	Basically, you can raise the argument 'If you do't want an abortion, you could have easily avoided this situation'
2013-05-01 05:35:14	@McqfrTheScott	As in, the dispute should be construed in favour of the party who did not take active steps to arrive at the dispute
2013-05-01 05:35:17	@saimazoon	is this a personal rant of yours against abortion being a legal right?
2013-05-01 05:35:29	@saimazoon	what dispute are you talking about, McqfrTheScott
2013-05-01 05:35:34	@saimazoon	she takes your sperm and puts it into her vagina
2013-05-01 05:35:39	@McqfrTheScott	the woman in this case knew a dispute would arrive beforehand because the man told her, and she took active teps to get there anyway, so he man should get all the power to settle the dispute his way
2013-05-01 05:35:44	@saimazoon	you're not even in the slightest extent involved in that decision

2013-05-01 06:17:48	@saimazoon	if everyone were as smart as you are then you'd had no trait to make you stand out from the rest

2013-05-01 06:18:45	@saimazoon	it's frustrating because you don't know how to handle them

2013-05-01 06:53:32	Gennadius	as you know, american political parties are less ideologically pure in general than european ones. they are more like broad coalitions of ideologies, interests, and social groups

2013-05-01 07:13:34	@qfr	They are unclean
2013-05-01 07:18:19	Gennadius	maybe, but in america there is both the written constitution and a sort of unwritten constitution in terms of how power works and the structures in government and society. america is a two party system, and it is deeply entrenched in american political culture. if you want ideological purity, you either join a third party, or you contribute to a lobbyist group or think-tank that steers policy.
2013-05-01 07:18:51	@qfr	I think it has a lot do with the US election systems
2013-05-01 07:18:55	@shminux	there are no decent politicians

2013-05-01 07:20:37	@qfr	And of course the Republicans and the Democrats do everything in their power to prevent this from changing
2013-05-01 07:20:49	Gennadius	that used to be true to a degree even 50 years ago, when there were dramatic differences in the voting behavior of southern democrats vs. northern democrats.
2013-05-01 07:20:50	@qfr	Because it would lose them voters

2013-05-01 07:35:52	@Mike_HH	I think the parents are making it into something it isn't.

2013-05-01 10:34:11	@Mike_HH	heh
2013-05-01 10:34:24	Gennadius	it's pleasant to listen to
2013-05-01 10:35:12	@Mike_HH	there was this website where you could listen to dialects and accents
2013-05-01 10:35:22	@Mike_HH	and mine was most closely tied to the ones spoken in Alabama
2013-05-01 10:35:47	Gennadius	fascinating.
2013-05-01 10:35:52	Gennadius	out of curiosity, Mike_HH:
2013-05-01 10:36:05	Gennadius	in some of the southeastern states, there's a grammatical feature called 'modal stacking'
2013-05-01 10:36:11	Gennadius	do you exhibit this in your speech?
2013-05-01 10:36:22	Gennadius	e.g. "i might could climb that tree."
2013-05-01 10:37:11	@Mike_HH	not me
2013-05-01 10:37:17	@Mike_HH	that's associated more with like, hicks
2013-05-01 10:37:21	@Mike_HH	people who aren't well educated
2013-05-01 10:37:49	Gennadius	yeah, america is a bitch in terms of stigmatizing "non-standard" forms. i have a friend from italy (linguistics graduate student) who thinks it is a bit unfair
2013-05-01 10:38:47	Gennadius	italy is a bit less judgmental towards regionalism. professors at universities can sound like they come from the mountains and won't be thought of as stupid
2013-05-01 10:39:24	@Mike_HH	well I don't think accent alone makes someone sound less educated
2013-05-01 10:39:37	@Mike_HH	but certain grammar features can be a bit much
2013-05-01 10:39:44	@Mike_HH	like I'll say y'all or ain't

2013-05-01 10:40:31	@Mike_HH	apparently vocabulary is also regional
2013-05-01 10:40:37	Gennadius	yes
2013-05-01 10:40:42	@Mike_HH	like my mother always says words like "buggy" and "britches"
2013-05-01 10:40:42	Gennadius	have you seen the new DARE?
2013-05-01 10:40:44	@Mike_HH	to mean like
2013-05-01 10:40:46	Gennadius	dictionary of american regional english
2013-05-01 10:40:47	@Mike_HH	"shopping cart" and "pants"
2013-05-01 10:40:50	@Mike_HH	no
2013-05-01 10:41:02	Gennadius	check it out, the last volume was published last year
2013-05-01 10:41:06	Gennadius	by harvard university press
2013-05-01 10:41:12	Gennadius	it's really a joy to look through
2013-05-01 10:41:15	Gennadius	a digital version is forthcoming
2013-05-01 10:41:36	Gennadius	there are some word samples on the project homepage. i'll find the link for you

2013-05-01 10:42:47	Gennadius	it's really a wonderful project. sources like private letters and diaries at the LOC are used
2013-05-01 10:43:16	Gennadius	it has attestation dates, distribution maps, etc.
2013-05-01 10:43:19	@Mike_HH	hm
2013-05-01 10:43:36	Gennadius	it gives me a lexicographic hard-on (pardon the vulgarity)
2013-05-01 10:44:22	Gennadius	sound philological principles applied to america's cultural patrimony

2013-05-01 10:48:17	Gennadius	"Southern American English" is painting with a bit too-broad brush
2013-05-01 10:48:41	Gennadius	it ignores regional and local particularities. granted, many of these have been leveled
2013-05-01 10:49:07	Gennadius	are you familiar, for example, with Outer Banks English spoken off the coast of North Carolina?
2013-05-01 10:49:10	Gennadius	or Lumbee English?
2013-05-01 10:50:48	@Mike_HH	Aren't Lumbees Native Americans?
2013-05-01 10:51:04	@Mike_HH	Wasn't Stacy Layne Matthews one?
2013-05-01 10:52:45	Gennadius	lumbees aren't exactly native americans, they're a triracial identity
2013-05-01 10:53:00	@no-n	http://i.imgur.com/XLwmeh4.jpg
2013-05-01 10:53:16	Gennadius	there are a number of triracial groups in the old backcountry and throughout the south, like melungeons and the redbones of louisiana
2013-05-01 10:53:53	Gennadius	lumbees don't have federal recognition
2013-05-01 10:54:36	Gennadius	there are some good videos on youtube about lumbee english actually

2013-05-01 13:15:18	Gennadius	for one, i do not think that "brain-death" in itself is constitutive of death. the traditional understanding of death isn't confined to the brain (and, in fact, some level of sub-conscious activity is measurable in even 'brain-dead' patients), but is more akin to "somatic death."

2013-05-01 13:21:30	@msk	notice the title
2013-05-01 13:21:36	Gennadius	it is my understanding, B-rat, that 'brain death' is not a scientific definition of death in any sense, but is instead an arbitrary legal protocol that was historically developed in order to facilitate organ harvesting
2013-05-01 13:21:51	@B-rat	you're literally retarded, Gennadius
2013-05-01 13:22:22	Gennadius	we may ask, "to what extent must necrosis be total in the neurons of the brain, and where must it be localized, in order to constitute 'brain death'?"
2013-05-01 13:22:32	Gennadius	99.9% of brain cells? just the brain stem?
2013-05-01 13:22:47	Gennadius	how is it determined?

2013-05-01 13:30:38	Gennadius	i say let the body die, and declare death upon somatic death. i see no reason to keep the body alive but the brain dead, other than the harvesting of organs, which i consider illegitimate, especially while the body itself is in all other senses alive (except the brain). the human person is more than the brain, even if the brain is the seat of consciousness, and a "brain-dead" person in my opinion is in an ambiguous state and isn

2013-05-01 14:36:59	@Cassowaries	Sumit Joshi, a mountain guide from Sydney, Australia, said by telephone from the Everest base camp that the argument started when the Sherpa guides, who were fixing ropes and digging a path on the snowy trail above Camp 2, asked the foreign climbers to wait until they were finished. He said the climbers ignored them and started climbing, knocking ice chunks onto the Sherpas below.
2013-05-01 14:37:05	@Cassowaries	The foreign climbers yelled "foul words" during an argument, he said.
2013-05-01 14:37:23	@Cassowaries	On their return to Camp 2 later in the evening, the three climbers were surrounded by 30-40 Sherpas and  there was a scuffle and punches were thrown,

2013-05-01 15:25:01	@Bucketphase	it would wokr if you didnt nail it down
2013-05-01 15:25:03	@B-rat	the pivot bit goes through the can and the arm attaches to the side so it could swing freely
2013-05-01 15:25:33	@Bucketphase	i dont know just do whatever
2013-05-01 15:25:36	@B-rat	well it wouldnt be nailed to both bits, just to the swing arm, obviously

2013-05-01 17:25:16	@Gennadius	no, B-rat, and for that reason orthodox jews have varied in their condemnation of lesbianism. some hold it may not be a violation of any commandment
2013-05-01 17:25:31	@B-rat	Gennadius, what about having a sex change
2013-05-01 17:25:45	@B-rat	oh man, no wonder lesbians are so cool

2013-05-01 17:26:48	@Gennadius	religions take different approaches to sex change. for the most part, i believe that biological sex is immutable. but the ayatollah khomeini, unusual for a stark religious conservative, embraced the notion that science is capable of turning men into women and vice versa
2013-05-01 17:26:58	@microcat	also it's totally okay to be a straight homophobic man and watch lesbian porn
2013-05-01 17:26:59	@Gennadius	in iran, homosexual men are pressured into sex change surgery for that reason
2013-05-01 17:27:26	@Gennadius	i don't think that "sex change surgery" is anything but mutilation of the body
2013-05-01 17:27:33	@Gennadius	and is unjustifiable under all circumstances

2013-05-01 17:30:24	pwca	who's with me?
2013-05-01 17:30:34	@Gennadius	furthermore, i think that the entire sex change industry is a sort of hucksterism. western people especially have a great amount of faith in science. what you have in the case of this surgery is people with a mental disorder (sexual dysphoria), and their fantasies are coddled by profiteers with a scalpel and a surgery to sale
2013-05-01 17:30:35	pwca	they are, qfr.

2013-05-01 17:37:11	@Gennadius	yes, they must be celibate, but if they fall, they can be forgiven. if the homosexual disposition is stable, it will be a lifelong struggle, but it will be a spiritual battle fought with grace of god (who gives us the capacity to resist temptation)

2013-05-01 17:40:27	@B-rat	Gennadius, how does the church verify if you can get it up or not

2013-05-01 17:40:34	pwca	how about hyenas, Gennadius? are they Christians?
2013-05-01 17:40:36	@qfr	Cassowaries, we haven't discussed your sex live in public in ages
2013-05-01 17:40:41	@B-rat	and what if you can only get it up when you see child pornography, Gennadius
2013-05-01 17:40:48	@B-rat	does that mean you can still marry
2013-05-01 17:40:51	@Gennadius	yes, because the marital act (completed coitus) is necessary for the consummation of matrimony
2013-05-01 17:40:55	@Cassowaries	qfr, it's going well, I'm still being forgiven for all my misdeeds

2013-05-01 18:01:52	pwca	if you're interested in Plato, B-rat, you should read The Open Society and Its Enemies.
2013-05-01 18:02:03	pwca	it's just a great indictment of everything Plato stood for.
2013-05-01 18:02:35	@B-rat	ok but
2013-05-01 18:02:39	@B-rat	why not just read plato
2013-05-01 18:02:45	pwca	because Plato is awful.
2013-05-01 18:02:53	@B-rat	you're an idiot

2013-05-01 18:04:38	@Gennadius	i think that's an unfair criticism. we see an upheaval of the traditional greek conception of eros in the symposium

2013-05-01 18:06:32	pwca	I mean, the topic is "philosophy of science" so I guess they feel obligated to include someone who could claim some scientifical relevance.

2013-05-02 00:47:14	@Mike_H	it's bad because they are caricatures of "ripped from the front page" stories and there's a shitload of misery and nobody laughs at it
2013-05-02 00:47:26	@Mike_H	at least in Corrie you could always laugh at how horrid off Jack and Vera were
2013-05-02 00:47:33	@Bucketecaf	thanks for stating the obvious
2013-05-02 00:47:39	@Mike_H	on EastEnders everyone is miserable and they just sit around looking dour for 30 minutes and then doof doof doof doof
2013-05-02 00:47:46	@Mike_H	Bucketecaf: I WAS SUMMARIZING THE ARTICLE YEH
2013-05-02 00:47:51	@Bucketecaf	but "ripped from the front page" is more of a criticism of tabloids than of eastenders
2013-05-02 00:48:06	@Mike_H	Bucketecaf: well specifically they mean that stupid inner city gang kids storyline
2013-05-02 00:48:06	@BadAtom	eastenders actors lead more exciting lives than their storylines too
2013-05-02 00:48:07	@Bucketecaf	DOOF DOOF is the best part of eastenders
2013-05-02 00:48:11	@Bucketecaf	the one true constant in my life
2013-05-02 00:48:29	@Bucketecaf	that's what soaps are though mike
2013-05-02 00:48:31	@BadAtom	the guy who played Den was a convicted murderer of germans as well as "He also allegedly dressed as Captain Hook whilst pleasuring himself, shared his sexual fantasies about animals"
2013-05-02 00:48:46	@Bucketecaf	anyway, you're complaining about coronation street and eastenders
2013-05-02 00:48:53	@Bucketecaf	haven't you been keepign up with fair city?
2013-05-02 00:49:20	@Mike_H	Bucketecaf: what show gets watched more on One
2013-05-02 00:49:23	@Mike_H	EastEnders or Fair City
2013-05-02 00:49:33	@Bucketecaf	fair city prob
2013-05-02 00:49:36	@Bucketecaf	it's repeated more than eastenders too i thin
2013-05-02 00:49:36	@Bucketecaf	k
2013-05-02 00:50:09	@Mike_H	I hardly find Fair City on YouTube
2013-05-02 00:50:17	@Mike_H	or any newspaper websites talking about it
2013-05-02 00:50:29	@Mike_H	it isn't like the UK soaps like EastEnders/Corrie/Emmerdale where all the episodes get uploaded that evening
2013-05-02 00:50:34	@Bucketecaf	my sister just emailed me an application for deutsche bank
2013-05-02 00:50:36	@Mike_H	Fair City is one that is very very scarce

2013-05-02 00:51:21	@Mike_H	I could, I did that with the BBC iPlayer when I was following Stacey's bipolar storyline on EE
2013-05-02 00:51:32	@Mike_H	but it was a lot of work considering I am not that great with computer shit
2013-05-02 00:51:48	@Bucketecaf	anyway
2013-05-02 00:51:52	@Bucketecaf	you're not missing out

2013-05-02 11:28:13	@msk	Of course, if Paraguay is a friendly enough country (gun-wise) it might not be a bad precaution to buy a home there (how expensive could it be?) and have it stocked with some interesting items in case the SHTF up here and one must go on an extended vacation.

2013-05-02 11:59:55	@msk	Scientologists in Germany face specific political and economic restrictions. They are barred from membership in major political parties and employers use so-called "sect filters" to expose a job applicant's association with the organization.[citation needed] German federal and state interior ministers started a process aimed at banning Scientology in late 2007, but abandoned the initiative a year
2013-05-02 12:00:01	@msk	later, finding insufficient legal grounds. Despite this, polls suggest that most Germans favour banning Scientology altogether.

2013-05-02 12:01:06	@msk	In several cases between 1995 and 2000, the Switzerland Supreme Court consistently ruled that the Church of Scientology is primarily a commercial, rather than religious, organization.[55] There is also a law in Basel which makes it illegal to "dishonestly" accost people on the street, a law which was adopted to help combat proselytizing by Scientologists.[56]

2013-05-02 20:51:55	Gennadius	temptation is not in itself sinful, but deliberately taking pleasure in temptation by entertaining such thoughts is sinful
2013-05-02 20:53:18	Gennadius	in christianity, thoughts have moral status. you can "sin in your heart," even without committing an overt act of sin
2013-05-02 20:54:19	Gennadius	since sin is that which separates man from god. as men, we either choose to come closer to god, or to get further away.

2013-05-03 00:02:57	 *	sytse should stop consuming so much IRC
2013-05-03 00:03:17	@Cassowaries	irc is a gateway drug
2013-05-03 00:03:24	@Cassowaries	you might start believing some of this crap
2013-05-03 00:03:32	@sytse	impossible!
2013-05-03 00:03:48	pwca	IRC IS A GATEWAY INTO MY HEART, LOVERS
2013-05-03 00:03:57	@sytse	onoes
2013-05-03 00:03:58	<--	Oprichnik (~Oprichnik@unaffiliated/vimutaamyuuto) has quit (Quit: Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
2013-05-03 00:04:14	@sytse	pwca: take care you don't get a heart attack
2013-05-03 00:04:22	pwca	I found a nice category theory book.
2013-05-03 00:04:29	pwca	he writes: "Life isn't linear, but written words are."
2013-05-03 00:04:35	@BadAtom	it always starts with IRC, and ends with Braziw
2013-05-03 00:04:43	pwca	this is exactly the kind of thing I expect to find in a category theory book.
2013-05-03 00:04:45	@B-rat	Cassowaries, why do early pot users always think they arent acting weird while high when they're acting really fucking weird
2013-05-03 00:04:58	pwca	I hope the rest is as good.
2013-05-03 00:05:08	@Cassowaries	why do drunk people always think they're not that drunk
2013-05-03 00:05:29	@Cassowaries	same reason
2013-05-03 00:05:39	@B-rat	i only notice i'm drunk when i wake up in an unfamiliar place
2013-05-03 00:05:47	@B-rat	nah, i'm joking
2013-05-03 00:05:51	@B-rat	that only happened like three times
2013-05-03 00:06:04	@kehoea	that you remember
2013-05-03 00:06:08	@B-rat	yes
2013-05-03 00:06:16	@Cassowaries	anyway, the worst thing about stoners is the ones who think it somehow isn't harmful
2013-05-03 00:06:25	@Cassowaries	NAH WEED SMOKE IS ENTIRELY DIFFERENT TO EVERY OTHER KIND OF SMOKE
2013-05-03 00:06:29	@B-rat	also for some reason even when i still drank i never craved alcohol
2013-05-03 00:06:42	pwca	I only notice I am being psychotic when I am torturing a cat or a child.
2013-05-03 00:06:44	@B-rat	haha Cassowaries
2013-05-03 00:06:55	@B-rat	pwca, jesus are you insane, dont harm cats
2013-05-03 00:06:55	@BadAtom	I only notice I'm drunk when it's 4:AM and I haven't seen my pants in hours
2013-05-03 00:07:08	@B-rat	BadAtom, there is.. also a different reason for that sometimes
2013-05-03 00:07:31	@BadAtom	I meant on public transit though
2013-05-03 00:07:35	@B-rat	still
2013-05-03 00:07:44	@kehoea	qué lindo es el amor
2013-05-03 00:07:57	@Cassowaries	I went through a phase of waking up naked in other people's houses after having gone to bed clothed
2013-05-03 00:07:58	@sytse	I only notice I'm drunk when it's 6 AM and I haven't seen some other dude's pants in hours
2013-05-03 00:08:11	@B-rat	Cassowaries, were you also being haunted by a rabbit
2013-05-03 00:08:18	@Cassowaries	no, courted
2013-05-03 00:08:24	@B-rat	disturbing
2013-05-03 00:08:38	@BadAtom	swalling it with your cloaca != "courting"
2013-05-03 00:08:39	pwca	nice.
2013-05-03 00:08:42	@BadAtom	*swallowing
2013-05-03 00:08:51	@BadAtom	but swalling as well
2013-05-03 00:09:08	@Gennadius	why would you want to quit caffeine, B-rat?
2013-05-03 00:09:10	@sytse	(hm, that was the most gay-sounding thing I've ever said. whu)
2013-05-03 00:09:27	@sytse	actually, I notice I'm drunk when I'm typing perfect english or dutch on IRC
2013-05-03 00:09:28	@B-rat	Gennadius, mainly because it's boring
2013-05-03 00:09:28	@Cassowaries	you need to start saying gayer things
2013-05-03 00:09:31	@B-rat	i mean sure, some teas are nice
2013-05-03 00:09:41	@Gennadius	i love caffeine. would you believe that i have had 9 cups of coffee today?
2013-05-03 00:09:42	@B-rat	Cassowaries, which one of us
2013-05-03 00:09:46	@BadAtom	sytse: no it wasn't, the gayest thing you've ever said was:  <@sytse> I'm dutch
2013-05-03 00:09:46	@sytse	..but it takes me half a minute per word, of which 20 seconds are spent trying to read it
2013-05-03 00:09:47	pwca	I only notice I am drunk when I am feeling really inebriated.
2013-05-03 00:09:49	@Cassowaries	definitely not you, B-rat
2013-05-03 00:09:52	@sytse	BadAtom: lol
2013-05-03 00:09:53	@B-rat	:D
2013-05-03 00:10:07	pwca	I really like coffee too.
2013-05-03 00:10:16	@B-rat	i havent had coffee since february last year
2013-05-03 00:10:22	@Gennadius	it is the only drug, really, that i permit myself. i have no interest in alcohol, which saps vitality and clouds the thought.
2013-05-03 00:10:23	pwca	what the fuck.
2013-05-03 00:10:33	@B-rat	i'm kind of growing tired of tea as well
2013-05-03 00:10:40	pwca	oh, you drink tea.
2013-05-03 00:10:47	@B-rat	i only really enjoy drugs socially tbh
2013-05-03 00:10:57	@B-rat	and most of the people i used to hang out with annoy me now so
2013-05-03 00:11:00	@sytse	it's crazy how much trouble it is trying to figure out which letters those pixels spell out and whether that's the way it's supposed to be spelled, when drunk
2013-05-03 00:11:16	pwca	why do they annoy you?
2013-05-03 00:11:19	@Cassowaries	I rarely ever have that problem
2013-05-03 00:11:24	@Cassowaries	@sytse
2013-05-03 00:11:36	@B-rat	pwca, various reasons that i wont get into
2013-05-03 00:11:36	pwca	whose problem do you rarely ever have?
2013-05-03 00:11:36	@kehoea	Gennadius, do you feel that clear thinking is appropriate for every occasion?
2013-05-03 00:11:56	@B-rat	i think it is, kehoea
2013-05-03 00:12:07	@Gennadius	yes, kehoea
2013-05-03 00:12:08	@B-rat	too much traumatic shit has happened to some of my close friends lately
2013-05-03 00:12:22	pwca	trauma queens.
2013-05-03 00:12:27	@B-rat	D:
2013-05-03 00:12:30	@Cassowaries	clever
2013-05-03 00:12:34	@Gennadius	i believe that it is mortally sinful to willfully drink to the point that moral judgment is impaired
2013-05-03 00:12:39	@B-rat	but seriously, the world is a terrible place
2013-05-03 00:12:53	@sytse	what's even more weird, is that I do manage some (even when not drunk) dangerous slopes on the bicycle but then have lots of trouble figuring out what it is that I typed on IRC
2013-05-03 00:13:06	@Gennadius	st. thomas aquinas, in his summa theologica, teachs that we may licitly drink to the point of hilarity, but no more
2013-05-03 00:13:11	@Gennadius	teaches*
2013-05-03 00:13:18	@kehoea	then I disagree with you, Gennadius, I think for example that wasting time on IRC very much does not require clear thinking and is more enjoyable in its absence
2013-05-03 00:13:20	pwca	hilarity to himself or to others?
2013-05-03 00:14:25	@sytse	or of the situation itself?
2013-05-03 00:14:31	@B-rat	i dont waste time the entire time i'm on irc
2013-05-03 00:14:43	@B-rat	i am in plenty of channels with productive discussion
2013-05-03 00:14:52	@sytse	spending time is a waste
2013-05-03 00:15:01	@sytse	I never did find a way not to spend time though
2013-05-03 00:15:13	@sytse	even harder than not spending money
2013-05-03 00:15:32	@Gennadius	i would not want to misrepresent what aquinas said, pwca, so i am attempting to track down the quotation
2013-05-03 00:16:21	@Cassowaries	what if you misrepresented it to the point of hilarity
2013-05-03 00:18:20	@Gennadius	i'm having some difficulty
2013-05-03 00:18:23	@B-rat	also i dont really seem to have a lack of energy lately, despite not having any caffeine
2013-05-03 00:18:38	@Gennadius	however, i will take recourse to another great saint, st. benedict of nursia, who allowed his monks one hemina of wine per day
2013-05-03 00:18:51	@Gennadius	in his monastic rule
2013-05-03 00:18:51	@BadAtom	hemina hemina
2013-05-03 00:19:11	pwca	how much is a hemina?
2013-05-03 00:19:13	@Bucketphase	by the power of the grey skull
2013-05-03 00:19:15	@Bucketphase	i am hemina
2013-05-03 00:19:35	@Gennadius	yes, BadAtom, unfortunately, the original hemina measuring cup a the monastery of monte cassino was stolen by saracens when they raided and harried throughout italy
2013-05-03 00:20:04	@Gennadius	however, it is typically taken to mean around the equivalent of two glasses, based on a conversation with a friend of mine who spent 7 years as a monk
2013-05-03 00:20:19	pwca	how long did the conversation last?
2013-05-03 00:20:19	@B-rat	how large are your glasses
2013-05-03 00:20:33	@B-rat	when we drank wine we had like a bottle per person
2013-05-03 00:20:36	@B-rat	in rather large mugs
2013-05-03 00:20:39	@Gennadius	long enough, pwca, it is one of my oldest and dearest friends
2013-05-03 00:20:45	pwca	how old is he?
2013-05-03 00:20:49	pwca	where was he a monk?
2013-05-03 00:20:55	@Bucketphase	did your monk friend ever find out which monks kept the beat back in the carolingian period of church music
2013-05-03 00:21:03	@Gennadius	you're not him, are you?
2013-05-03 00:21:14	@Bucketphase	doubt it
2013-05-03 00:21:18	@Bucketphase	norwegians are all pagans
2013-05-03 00:21:25	@Gennadius	late 40s, pwca
2013-05-03 00:21:27	@B-rat	sexy sexy pagans
2013-05-03 00:21:39	@Spaceghost	.c 259 € to USD
2013-05-03 00:21:40	@Gennadius	i won't tell you the monastery, but it's in switzerland
2013-05-03 00:21:40	@lingbot	337.3993 U.S. dollars
2013-05-03 00:21:59	pwca	I know someone who is presently in a monastery.
2013-05-03 00:22:08	@Gennadius	interesting
2013-05-03 00:22:27	@Gennadius	which one?
2013-05-03 00:22:34	pwca	no idea.
2013-05-03 00:22:38	@Gennadius	where?
2013-05-03 00:22:44	pwca	I don't know.
2013-05-03 00:22:55	pwca	I just know the person in the monastery. I don't know any details about the monastery.
2013-05-03 00:23:02	pwca	or what they do there.
2013-05-03 00:23:10	@Gennadius	ah
2013-05-03 00:23:20	@Gennadius	well, generally speaking, in benedictine monasticism, there are two sorts of monks:
2013-05-03 00:23:22	pwca	although as far as I have gathered it involves moon-light rituals in the forest.
2013-05-03 00:23:54	@Gennadius	there are choir monks, who are the more educated sort, and there are the brothers
2013-05-03 00:24:37	pwca	are the brothers chill?
2013-05-03 00:24:46	@Bucketphase	they're people that oculdnt get real jobs
2013-05-03 00:24:50	@Bucketphase	prett ychill
2013-05-03 00:24:58	@sytse	so they're like stoners
2013-05-03 00:25:19	pwca	are they sometimes actual stoners?
2013-05-03 00:25:20	@sytse	or philosophy students
2013-05-03 00:25:34	pwca	do you think they could be allowed one hemina of good bud?
2013-05-03 00:25:34	@Gennadius	additionally, there are specific offices like cellarer, guest-master, porter/gatekeeper, the abbot
2013-05-03 00:26:38	@sytse	do they earn all the money for upkeep / construction of the monastery themselves?
2013-05-03 00:26:53	pwca	do they invest in stocks?
2013-05-03 00:26:57	pwca	do they have a pension fund?
2013-05-03 00:27:11	@BadAtom	pagans?
2013-05-03 00:27:58	<--	B-rat (~notrewt@about/philosophy/b-rat) has quit (Quit: sleep)
2013-05-03 00:28:16	@sytse	pwca: a union!
2013-05-03 00:28:17	@Gennadius	i'm not sure about the use of cannabis, pwca. as you are aware, the status of wine in western culture is more central. i'm not sure if the recreational use of cannabis is akin to the recreational use of moderate amounts of alcohol
2013-05-03 00:28:35	@Gennadius	i am not sure if it possible to get high without impairing the moral faculties
2013-05-03 00:28:40	@sytse	I do not think pwca was very serious about his question :D
2013-05-03 00:28:51	pwca	I was very serious.
2013-05-03 00:28:56	@Cassowaries	all questions in this channel are to be taken seriously
2013-05-03 00:28:59	@Cassowaries	it's a rule
2013-05-03 00:29:01	pwca	there's a monk that sometimes writes in the newspaper here.
2013-05-03 00:29:02	@sytse	lol
2013-05-03 00:29:09	pwca	it's interesting.
2013-05-03 00:29:15	pwca	but he might be a faux monk.
2013-05-03 00:29:24	pwca	since I do not believe monks are allowed to write newspaper articles.
2013-05-03 00:29:28	@Gennadius	well, even when there's not a serious question, it is often the most ridiculous questions that can be the most illuminating
2013-05-03 00:29:52	@Cassowaries	in general, Gennadius, I think cannabis is less of a danger to one's moral compass
2013-05-03 00:29:55	@sytse	or the most boring ones that generate the most ridiculous (true) answers
2013-05-03 00:30:08	@Cassowaries	however, it doesn't help with the sin of sloth, for example
2013-05-03 00:30:18	@sytse	Cassowaries: much less than alcohol I'd guess, yes
2013-05-03 00:30:19	@koinlet	Cassowaries, kysyitkö suomalaista?
2013-05-03 00:30:38	@koinlet	I have never seen -yi- before in my life in finnish I must admit, it looks weird.
2013-05-03 00:30:39	@sytse	alcohol basically helps with all the sins under the sun
2013-05-03 00:30:44	@koinlet	I don't even know if this is the way to do it,it seems so.
2013-05-03 00:30:58	@koinlet	I guess it's also there in siirryit.
2013-05-03 00:31:04	@mostlybadfly	iLogical_: what
2013-05-03 00:31:25	pwca	what is siirryit.
2013-05-03 00:31:37	@koinlet	It means 'you moved'
2013-05-03 00:31:44	@koinlet	Not something else, only yourself.
2013-05-03 00:31:50	pwca	only me?
2013-05-03 00:31:50	@koinlet	Love that about Finnish, no fucking ergative verbs
2013-05-03 00:31:52	pwca	or only you?
2013-05-03 00:31:54	@sytse	Cassowaries: for TRUE help with sloth, try diazepam
2013-05-03 00:32:13	@sytse	diazepam is awesome
2013-05-03 00:32:15	@koinlet	Well, there are two different verbs for 'John moves a box' and 'John moves'
2013-05-03 00:32:19	@Clint	that increases sloth
2013-05-03 00:32:27	pwca	well, sure.

2013-05-03 00:33:09	@Gennadius	pwca: there are different forms of the religious life. not all monks are cloistered within communities. there are entire orders of friars engaged in the active life, rather than the strictly contemplative.
2013-05-03 00:33:28	pwca	why would you call them friars?
2013-05-03 00:33:32	pwca	isn't that a bit flippant?
2013-05-03 00:34:15	@sytse	'Christian monastic life has adapted to modern society by offering computer services, accounting services and management as well as modern hospital and educational administration.'
2013-05-03 00:34:18	@Gennadius	for example, franciscan friars are actively engaged in ministry and service especially in poor urban areas.
2013-05-03 00:34:19	@sytse	huh.
2013-05-03 00:34:20	pwca	oh, sorry. I thought it meant something else.
2013-05-03 00:34:31	pwca	cheap rent?
2013-05-03 00:34:32	@Gennadius	friar comes from the latin frater, meaning brother
2013-05-03 00:34:54	@Cassowaries	diazepam does not agree with me, sytse
2013-05-03 00:34:58	@sytse	I wonder what happens when a monastery goes bankrupt
2013-05-03 00:34:59	@Cassowaries	always shoots down all my ideas
2013-05-03 00:35:24	@Cassowaries	en tiennyt pyydetty, koinlet
2013-05-03 00:35:30	@Gennadius	that happens, sytse
2013-05-03 00:35:39	@Gennadius	would you read a book if i were to recommend it?
2013-05-03 00:35:58	@koinlet	Cassowaries, mitä pyytää tarkoittaa?
2013-05-03 00:35:58	@sytse	Cassowaries: I did not feel a big need for ideas at the time I used it.. lack of ideas > extreme pain all day long
2013-05-03 00:36:13	@Gennadius	i really enjoyed reading the chronicle of the abbey of bury st. edmund, written by jocelyn of brakelonde
2013-05-03 00:36:42	@koinlet	Cassowaries, besides, I have three different forms 'I move [something else]', 'I move [myself out of free will]' and 'I move [without being able to help it'
2013-05-03 00:36:43	@sytse	I have too much to read already..
2013-05-03 00:36:45	@sytse	but thanks :)
2013-05-03 00:36:59	@koinlet	Though I guess the last is just the first form but comes down to 'there's something that moves me'
2013-05-03 00:37:00	pwca	so much chat to read.
2013-05-03 00:37:06	@Gennadius	there are some interesting bits in it about the monks taking out loans from jews using sacred vessels as collateral
2013-05-03 00:37:08	pwca	and reddit.

2013-05-03 00:37:31	@Bucketphase	yeah sounds like a good book though Gennadius
2013-05-03 00:37:32	@Gennadius	i read it in one sitting. i just got absorbed in it
2013-05-03 00:37:40	@Gennadius	it took me longer with the latin
2013-05-03 00:37:43	@Bucketphase	i read a lot of stuff like that when i did musicology

2013-05-03 00:40:01	@koinlet	Like 'listen' is volitary, hear is not volitary
2013-05-03 00:40:22	@koinlet	In some cases English has diferent verbs for it, especially when it considers sensory things
2013-05-03 00:40:30	@koinlet	look, see, is the same thing.

2013-05-03 00:48:12	@koinlet	THere are a lot of languages which mark this difference in some way.

2013-05-03 00:49:17	Gennadius	yes, it is a small world
2013-05-03 00:49:33	@Cassowaries	koinlet, a finnish friend is currently telling me "autoin" implies several cars were used; I'd thought that was a morphological quirk
2013-05-03 00:49:40	@sytse	koinlet: well, at least I've learned to say 'I' instead of 'you' when describing phenomena that affect me, because of all the therapy ;-)
2013-05-03 00:50:03	@Cassowaries	he's not sure he's braining that well though
2013-05-03 00:50:15	Gennadius	i could see myself entering the religious life at some point, perhaps. i don't really feel a calling to marriage
2013-05-03 00:50:55	@sytse	koinlet: interesting how effective linguistic techniques like that can be
2013-05-03 00:53:53	@koinlet	Cassowaries, I am pretty sure it is a morphological quirk as well, but each fin tells me something different on that.
2013-05-03 00:54:03	@koinlet	Cassowaries, truth be told, finns seem to disagree _ a lot_ on finnish
2013-05-03 00:54:05	@Cassowaries	haha, yup
2013-05-03 00:54:13	@koinlet	You notied that too eh?
2013-05-03 00:54:24	@koinlet	One tells me that something is perfectly fine grammatically, another tells me you can never do it.
2013-05-03 00:54:29	@Cassowaries	I mean, I'm fairly certain myself that when you use the instructive deverbally there's no plural connotation
2013-05-03 00:54:37	@koinlet	Indeed
2013-05-03 00:54:43	@Cassowaries	but I think the issue here is that it's archaic
2013-05-03 00:54:47	@Cassowaries	or archaicising
2013-05-03 00:54:51	@koinlet	THat's another thing it has in common with 'by car', it doesn't differentiate number
2013-05-03 00:55:02	@koinlet	'by car' can mean with any number of cars involved.
2013-05-03 00:55:19	@Cassowaries	yeah, "all 1000 of us went by car"
2013-05-03 00:55:22	Gennadius	"We shall duel... by car!"
2013-05-03 00:55:25	@Cassowaries	haha
2013-05-03 00:55:27	@Cassowaries	even better
2013-05-03 00:55:38	@koinlet	Or like ehh 'kaikin pyhin' that also confuses that, some say it's perfectly fine to say 'By all that is holy', some say it makes no sense to say that.
2013-05-03 00:55:59	@Cassowaries	yeah I wouldn't've thought that made sense
2013-05-03 00:56:08	@koinlet	kaikin pyhin?
2013-05-03 00:56:11	@Cassowaries	yes
2013-05-03 00:56:17	@koinlet	Well, it's the instructive case of kaikki pyhä
2013-05-03 00:56:22	@koinlet	All the holy things
2013-05-03 00:56:30	@Cassowaries	yes I understand the morphology
2013-05-03 00:56:47	@koinlet	Minä menen autoin. I'm going by car, minä menen kaikin pyhin. I m going by all hat is holy.
2013-05-03 00:56:50	@Cassowaries	I just don't know how you can do something using all the holy
2013-05-03 00:57:01	Gennadius	if finns disagree, could we ask an estonian?
2013-05-03 00:57:04	@koinlet	Well, that is where they differ.
2013-05-03 00:57:06	@Cassowaries	oh god no
2013-05-03 00:57:10	@Clint	hitler
2013-05-03 00:57:12	@koinlet	Finns seriously disagree _a lot_ on Finnish.
2013-05-03 00:57:20	@Cassowaries	estonian and finnish are really really similar, except when it comes to the cases, Gennadius

2013-05-03 00:57:44	@Cassowaries	or so it seems
2013-05-03 00:57:49	Gennadius	interesting, Cassowaries
2013-05-03 00:58:12	@Cassowaries	koinlet, yeah, I think that's a result of the specificity of the language
2013-05-03 00:59:04	@Clint	and the synchronicity of the ring
2013-05-03 00:59:22	@Cassowaries	although this guy is great in that respect

2013-05-03 00:59:34	Gennadius	are things much different in the dialects, then?
2013-05-03 00:59:47	@Cassowaries	and he is able to be much less sure, which is useful
2013-05-03 01:00:02	Gennadius	in terms of the semantics of case
2013-05-03 01:00:13	@koinlet	Cassowaries, but like you noticed it too?
2013-05-03 01:00:18	@Cassowaries	Gennadius, yeah, there are some significant grammatical differences in even the number of available cases
2013-05-03 01:00:28	@koinlet	Estonian has 14.
2013-05-03 01:00:34	@koinlet	Doesn't have some Finnish has and has some extra cases.
2013-05-03 01:00:41	@koinlet	THere are also dialects of finnish which have an excessive
2013-05-03 01:00:48	@koinlet	As in, it completes -na and -ksi
2013-05-03 01:00:52	@koinlet	With an external one.
2013-05-03 01:00:54	@Cassowaries	yeah, I meant within finnish
2013-05-03 01:01:31	@koinlet	excessive makes sense hoestly.
2013-05-03 01:01:50	@koinlet	If it were up to me, it would've been royally decreed that the illative henceforth was to be written as -sse
2013-05-03 01:01:56	Gennadius	formerly, there was a baltic finnic dialect continuum of sorts stretching to estonia, yes?
2013-05-03 01:03:10	@koinlet	THe essive as -rra, the excessive as -rta and the translative as -rre or something.

2013-05-03 01:09:36	@koinlet	Well yeah, I mean a phonemic one of course.

2013-05-03 01:10:07	@koinlet	I mean that Finns do very little with their intonation.

2013-05-03 01:10:36	Gennadius	no, i'm thinking finnish. jacek fisiak, in his book "LInguistic Reconstruction and Typology" mentions finnish as an example of a language with a "strong pitch accent on the first syllable of words"
2013-05-03 01:10:57	@BadAtom	then he is confusing the finns with something else

2013-05-03 01:33:20	Gennadius	insurance company policies
2013-05-03 01:33:28	@Clint	ah yes
2013-05-03 01:34:13	Gennadius	the cost is passed down to the customer, meaning employers, or those who purchase policies for themselves. as a consumer, your choice is restricted and you are forced to pay for products you have no use for.
2013-05-03 01:34:43	@Clint	yes, i am also pissed off that my health insurance covers diseases i don't have
2013-05-03 01:34:50	@BadAtom	what's stopping men from getting breast exams

2013-05-03 01:35:12	Gennadius	i also do not like that it is forbidden for insurance companies to charge women higher rates than men
2013-05-03 01:35:23	@BadAtom	just show up at the doctor's waving a gun and your insurance form and demand he fondle your moobs as part of a paid contract for services
2013-05-03 01:35:48	Gennadius	women are more likely to use healthcare services than men. they are more likely to actively seek treatment and to undergo routine testing and check-ups.
2013-05-03 01:35:49	@Clint	you realize that insurance premiums don't scale with actual coverage, right?
2013-05-03 01:36:08	Gennadius	women are more expensive for an insurance company to cover than men, hence they should be charged more
2013-05-03 01:36:42	Gennadius	prohibiting discrimination against pre-existing conditions only forces the rest of us to carry that burden
2013-05-03 01:37:23	Gennadius	the individual mandate, likewise, forces the young to carry the burden of the old, since it is the young who are more likely to be uninsured, since they are in good health, and it makes better financial sense for them to go uninsured than i does the old
2013-05-03 01:37:31	@Clint	people should only pay for the health care that they use, and not for any insurance at all!
2013-05-03 01:37:44	Gennadius	i would support that idea, Clint
2013-05-03 01:38:01	@Clint	then why do you have insurance
2013-05-03 01:40:01	Gennadius	because it is necessary in an environment in which healthcare is otherwise unaffordable. but if the government did not introduce moral hazard and inflate medical costs by actively subsidizing the industry, it would be more affordable, and that would be far more practical.

2013-05-03 01:44:05	@BadAtom	anyways, it's difficult to imagine how obamacare might inflate healthcosts, since USians are already paying vastly more for basic health services than anywhere with 100% socialized medicare
2013-05-03 01:44:56	Gennadius	in any case, i believe the solution to more affordable healthcare costs lies in a freer market, with more competition and less government involvement, not the contrary.

2013-05-03 01:46:24	Gennadius	there is also a tremendous amount of cost incurred through "free riders," uninsured people whom hospitals are not free to turn away without treatment who simply use the emergency room. they are forced to pass these costs onto paying customers, including insurers.

2013-05-03 01:51:25	Gennadius	personally, i believe the state has taken on too many functions that should be left to private society. in doing so, it has failed to provide services as well as the organic institutions of community, and it has also proved socially corrosive by undermining institutions like the church.
2013-05-03 01:51:58	@BadAtom	yeah, undermining institutions like the church is the job of christianity, the government should butt out of that

2013-05-03 01:55:56	@BadAtom	what is "it"?
2013-05-03 01:56:22	Gennadius	social welfarism
2013-05-03 01:56:44	@BadAtom	yeah that's it, stupid social services making everyone starve all over the place
2013-05-03 01:56:55	@talib	Gennadius, because helping another human being should be entangled with religion, right?
2013-05-03 01:57:10	Gennadius	in a truly private society, individuals would of course be much more concerned for one another, since they would genuinely rely upon each other's assistance, and not the state.
2013-05-03 01:57:22	@BadAtom	the reason the vast majority of people in the US are homeless is because of untreated mental illness
2013-05-03 01:57:40	@BadAtom	which is because there is no socialized coverage of mental healthcare
2013-05-03 01:57:50	@koinlet	Cassowaries, are there still things you have to admit, I lose track
2013-05-03 01:57:56	Gennadius	that's not exactly true, BadAtom
2013-05-03 01:58:02	@talib	high unemployment rate
2013-05-03 01:58:38	Gennadius	national coalition for the homeless: Approximately 20 - 25% of the single adult homeless population suffers from some form of
2013-05-03 01:58:38	Gennadius	severe and persistent mental illness
2013-05-03 01:59:05	Gennadius	a female homeless person is more likely to be mentally ill than a male.
2013-05-03 01:59:08	@BadAtom	and twice as many suffer from lesser but still debilitating forms
2013-05-03 01:59:19	@BadAtom	which puts the ante somewhere up around 75%
2013-05-03 01:59:47	Gennadius	substance abuse is also a very common cause
2013-05-03 02:00:14	@BadAtom	substance abuse is also in an overwhelming majority of case the result of mental problems and self-medications
2013-05-03 02:00:19	Gennadius	for plenty of people, as inscrutable as it may seem to us, a fix is more important than a roof over your head.

2013-05-03 02:04:17	Gennadius	maybe you don't come from a social context in which abuse of drugs like heroin, cocaine, and methamphetamine are fixtures of youth culture, but i've seen that. i chose not to move in those circles, but there are people i used to know who are now picking through garbage or looking for scrap metal to sell for heroin
2013-05-03 02:05:09	Gennadius	they're not homeless, but only because people feel sorry for them and enable their habits
2013-05-03 02:05:18	Gennadius	last i knew, at least
2013-05-03 02:05:33	@BadAtom	that's right, people do bath salts because they want sympathy
2013-05-03 02:06:16	Gennadius	a lot of the people who do bath salts don't know any better. they're stupid kids looking to have fun, and they don't want to go through the expense/illegality of buying marijuana
2013-05-03 02:06:22	Gennadius	or they are on probation

2013-05-03 02:30:31	@Mike_H	O'Connor was approved by the Senate by a vote of 99-0 on September 21, 1981. Senator Max Baucus (D-MT) did not vote.[4]
2013-05-03 02:30:40	@Mike_H	Scalia was approved by the Senate by a vote of 98-0 on September 17, 1986. Senators Jake Garn (R-UT) and Barry Goldwater (R-AZ) did not vote.[6]
2013-05-03 02:30:51	@Mike_H	On October 23, 1987, the Senate rejected Bork's confirmation, with 42 senators voting in favor and 58 voting against. Senators David Boren (D-OK) and Ernest Hollings (D-SC) voted in favor, with Senators John Chafee (R-RI), Bob Packwood (R-OR), Richard Shelby (D-AL), Arlen Specter (R-PA), Robert Stafford (R-VT), John Warner (R-VA) and Lowell P. Weicker, Jr. (R-CT) all voting no.[23]
2013-05-03 02:31:12	@Mike_H	After Ginsburg's withdrawal, Reagan nominated Anthony Kennedy on November 11, and he was then confirmed to fill the vacancy on February 3, 1988.[27][28]
2013-05-03 02:31:22	@Mike_H	Kennedy endorsed Griswold as well as the right to privacy, calling it "a zone of liberty, a zone of protection, a line that's drawn where the individual can tell the Government, 'Beyond this line you may not go.'"[32] This gave Kennedy more bipartisan support than Bork and Ginsburg. The Senate confirmed him by a vote of 97 to 0.[32]
2013-05-03 02:32:12	@Mike_H	and then
2013-05-03 02:32:13	@Mike_H	In his second term, Reagan elevated William Rehnquist to succeed Warren Burger as Chief Justice.[5] Rehnquist's confirmation was largely split along party lines, showing that he had not improved his standing among Senate Democrats since his contentious 1971 nomination to the Court.[5]
2013-05-03 02:32:22	@Clint	and kennedy sucks less than scalia or rehnquist, so there you go
2013-05-03 02:32:24	@Mike_H	Rehnquist's elevation to Chief Justice was approved by the Senate by a vote of 65-33 on September 17, 1986. Senators Jake Garn (R-UT) and Barry Goldwater (R-AZ) did not vote. Senator Alan Simpson (R-WY) made public note on the Senate floor that Senator Garn's vote would have been to confirm had he been present.[5]

2013-05-03 03:47:08	@Mike_H	CBS had 50 nominations, the most for any network. Its total was boosted by "The Young and The Restless," which had more nods --23 -- than any other daytime series. It was nominated alongside “General Hospital,” “The Bold and the Beautiful,” “Days of Our Lives”  and “One Life to Live” for outstanding drama series.

2013-05-03 10:18:51	@msk	It seems that few people even bother to Google lol at this point—fans of the multiplayer game League of Legends now account for the top 10 lol-related search terms.
2013-05-03 10:20:17	@msk	There are other ways to get across similar feelings. You could use an emoticon or emoji. You could type “haha.” Or you could use one or many English adjectives. But in most chat situations, lol is superior to these alternatives. It’s shorter than English adjectives and haha (which, of course, is not any less silly than lol), and it’s less typographically demanding than :).

Will often evoke anger in people who are trying to talk to the texter.

2013-05-03 18:46:45	@qfr	saimazoon might know a bit
2013-05-03 18:47:19	@qfr	Diablo84, afaik the Qur'aan has no special meter or anything like that
2013-05-03 18:47:27	@qfr	It's regular prose for the most part
2013-05-03 18:47:37	@qfr	There are some rhyme-like constructs in certain places
2013-05-03 18:48:07	@qfr	At the beginning of 3-4 surat
2013-05-03 18:49:07	@qfr	Diablo84, they basically just believe that the Qur'aan is an amazing text because they are devout Muslims
2013-05-03 18:49:25	@qfr	Arabic poetry from the time is artistically far more pleasing

2013-05-03 18:50:10	@qfr	The Qur'aan wasn't written to be sung or recited in a particularly elegant way
2013-05-03 18:50:11	Diablo84	qfr, I see. But the point is that it is a very very popular argument online, and Muslim apologists even have whole workshops built around this particular argument. http://us1.campaign-archive2.com/?u=ebb500c4922ec74a0f5b35a48&id=61bbcc4a0d
2013-05-03 18:50:42	Diablo84	fqr, See the links here for example http://www.reddit.com/r/islam/comments/1btag1/are_there_any_peer_reviewed_confirmations_of_the/c99vlu0 this argument is used to win debates and "prove" that the Quran is divine.
2013-05-03 18:50:44	@B-rat	from both ends
2013-05-03 18:51:07	Diablo84	I wish someone properly challenged this claim.
2013-05-03 18:51:08	@Clint	the qur'an is poetry
2013-05-03 18:53:43	Diablo84	How true is this? "All Arabic speech fits into these categories except the Qur'an. It doesn't fit into any. The closest that some have come to categorizing it is to make a new category, "Qur'anic Saj", and nothing else fits it. The challenge in the Qur'an is for anyone to produce a chapter (surah) like it in Arabic. Namely, that doesn't fit any of those categories." http://www.reddit.com/r/islam/comments/gksdr/are_there_any_scientific_miracles_left_in

2013-05-03 19:54:53	@koinlet	If 'as' is used as a praeposition or conjunction actually changes the meaning of the sentence...
2013-05-03 19:55:07	@koinlet	"I will no longer stand as your brother" does not mean "I will no longer stand as your brother stands"
2013-05-03 19:55:29	@koinlet	"As your brother" is just an adverbial phrase that speaks to the verb itself.
2013-05-03 19:55:37	@koinlet	Similar to "I will no longer stand before your brother"
2013-05-03 19:55:47	@koinlet	Doesn't mean "I will no longer stand before your brother stands"
2013-05-03 19:56:12	@koinlet	Note that pretty much _any_ English praeposition can also be used as a conjunction where it comes before a full english sentence with a finite verb, not a noun phrase.
2013-05-03 19:56:31	@koinlet	'THey all went there, except me'

2013-05-03 21:27:43	@koinlet	spectie, anyway, you must agree the argument for the 'praepostional as' is quite compelling
2013-05-03 21:27:47	@qfr	Nazi anthems are "cool"?
2013-05-03 21:27:52	@koinlet	Since it  in fact fundamentally changes the meaning
2013-05-03 21:27:54	@qfr	;<
2013-05-03 21:28:06	@koinlet	'I will no longer stand as your brother' vs 'I will no longer stand as your brother stands'
2013-05-03 21:28:07	@spectie	koinlet, i agree
2013-05-03 21:28:14	@koinlet	spectie, but you're English mate.
2013-05-03 21:28:16	@spectie	it is a preposition
2013-05-03 21:28:21	@koinlet	You gotta defend the queen bruv.
2013-05-03 21:28:24	@koinlet	Well, it can function as both.
2013-05-03 21:28:27	@spectie	yes
2013-05-03 21:28:28	@koinlet	Like miost English praepositions.
2013-05-03 21:28:28	@spectie	exactly
2013-05-03 21:28:32	@spectie	conjunction and preposition
2013-05-03 21:28:35	@spectie	koinlet, "in" cannot
2013-05-03 21:28:52	@koinlet	True.
2013-05-03 21:28:55	@Clint	miosten deez
2013-05-03 21:29:05	@koinlet	'than' also can't function as a praeposition I think.
2013-05-03 21:29:08	@spectie	koinlet, "as" also requires an articulated NP if in singular and not-mass/count
2013-05-03 21:29:18	@koinlet	I'm not sure where the meaning there would change.
2013-05-03 21:29:19	@koinlet	NP?
2013-05-03 21:29:22	@spectie	noun phrase
2013-05-03 21:29:33	@spectie	e.g. as a polar bear, i like cats
2013-05-03 21:29:42	@spectie	*as polar bear, i like cats
2013-05-03 21:29:59	@koinlet	Well, that doesn't make it less conjunctive.
2013-05-03 21:30:21	@koinlet	But that sentence is ambiguous.
2013-05-03 21:30:29	@koinlet	It can also mean 'as I like polar bears, I like cats' I guess
2013-05-03 21:30:35	@spectie	no
2013-05-03 21:30:36	@spectie	it cannot
2013-05-03 21:30:39	@spectie	it can mean
2013-05-03 21:30:45	@tonik	"Is it Halloween, or are those your real teeth?"
2013-05-03 21:30:52	@spectie	"as a polar bear [which i am], i like cats"
2013-05-03 21:30:55	@koinlet	'As I like a polar bear, I like cats', pardon*
2013-05-03 21:31:01	@spectie	"as a polar bear [which i a not], i like cats"
2013-05-03 21:31:21	@koinlet	I disagree, it can be parsed as either.
2013-05-03 21:32:12	@koinlet	For instance, in a case where semantics exclude the former
2013-05-03 21:32:14	@Clint	as saimazoon i mock saimazoon
2013-05-03 21:32:16	@Clint	like saimazoon i mock saimazoon
2013-05-03 21:32:19	@Clint	i mock saimazoon as saimazoon
2013-05-03 21:32:20	@koinlet	'as a huge slut, I want you to make me cum'
2013-05-03 21:32:22	@Clint	i mock saimazoon like saimazoon
2013-05-03 21:32:27	@koinlet	Well, even that is not ambiguous
2013-05-03 21:32:35	@koinlet	Let's say 'as a dirty whore, I want you to treat me'
2013-05-03 21:33:01	@koinlet	'as you treat a dirty whore, I want you to treat me'
2013-05-03 21:33:02	@deadside	qfr, your new version, you foole
2013-05-03 21:33:10	@koinlet	Not 'as being a dirty whore, I want you to treat me [for my wounds]'
2013-05-03 21:33:12	@deadside	qfr, not the old version
2013-05-03 21:33:15	@qfr	;s
2013-05-03 21:33:19	@qfr	it's still edgy as fuck
2013-05-03 21:33:27	@koinlet	spectie, admit, my argument is most compelling.
2013-05-03 21:34:01	@spectie	buttocks
2013-05-03 21:35:59	@Clint	cream his corn
2013-05-03 21:36:28	@koinlet	spectie, however, saying 'The tree is as big as me' is still wrong.
2013-05-03 21:36:38	@koinlet	Because it doesn't mean 'being me, the tree is as big'
2013-05-03 21:36:39	@spectie	no it isn't
2013-05-03 21:36:42	@koinlet	Yes it is
2013-05-03 21:36:44	@koinlet	It is a conjunction there
2013-05-03 21:36:44	@spectie	no it isn't
2013-05-03 21:36:49	@spectie	sure
2013-05-03 21:36:57	@spectie	if you want
2013-05-03 21:36:57	@koinlet	It is most definitely a short form of 'the tree is as big as I am'
2013-05-03 21:37:29	@koinlet	No, it cannot be a praeposition in that context, it simply doesn't mean 'as being I, the tree is as big'

2013-05-03 22:32:24	@B-rat	ah, no i like a lot of songs off the older albums too
2013-05-03 22:32:35	@qfr	Like initial [iu] vs. [ju] seems unnatural
2013-05-03 22:32:38	@qfr	In Latin
2013-05-03 22:32:41	@B-rat	but this album is more accessible i guess
2013-05-03 22:34:35	@koinlet	BadAtom, I nevers aid they were pronounced the same
2013-05-03 22:34:43	@koinlet	I'm saying they are phonemically the same because there is no minimal pair.
2013-05-03 22:34:59	@Gennadius	out of curiosity, are you guys aware of any cases where semivowels are analyzed as acting as syllable nuclei, in contrast to the corresponding vowel? like both /w/ and /u/ serving as licit syllable nuclei

2013-05-03 22:35:29	@Cassowaries	no, that sounds extremely improbable

2013-05-03 22:35:39	@koinlet	Well, you know a minimal pair?

2013-05-03 22:35:45	@qfr	Or something like that
2013-05-03 22:36:01	@koinlet	They were phonemically the same in Sanskrit by the way, at  least accordingly panini
2013-05-03 22:36:22	@Gennadius	you mean they are in allophonic distribution then
2013-05-03 22:36:34	@Cassowaries	that is the same thing, yes
2013-05-03 22:36:47	@koinlet	THey are phonemically the same in many languages, they were written with the same glyph and no one can produce a minimal pair so I see no reason to think they are phonemically destinct, at least not during classical latin

2013-05-03 22:58:40	@koinlet	kylos, the stress in finnish always falls on the first syllable.
2013-05-03 22:58:53	@koinlet	And you shouldn't really see it as 'long vowels' in finnish as much as a succession of the same vowel twice honestly.
2013-05-03 22:59:29	@koinlet	You can even see this in grammatical function, bread is leipä, partitive case ads -ä to a word, so this becomes leipää, a 'long vowel', in my experience if you say le-i-pä-ä finns can understand you
2013-05-03 22:59:41	@koinlet	It's easier to understand if you say the same vowel twice than if you say it short

2013-05-04 05:54:31	@emes	jaja

2013-05-04 05:54:51	@seimazuhn	NEEDMOAR: Lo debo de haber visto dos veces.
2013-05-04 05:54:54	Limada	seimazuhn: donde hubo fuego, cenizas quedan.

2013-05-04 05:55:42	@seimazuhn	Por la crisis, deben de haber elevado las visitas museísticas al estamento de bien de lujo.
2013-05-04 05:55:49	@seimazuhn	Y ahora debe pagarse entrada todos los días, inclusive los sábados.
2013-05-04 05:55:52	Limada	¿sirve decir que soy una mezcla de vascos y franceses?
2013-05-04 05:56:03	@Spaceghost	Sí, Limada.
2013-05-04 05:56:05	Limada	será por eso que soy tan pelotuda. (?)

2013-05-04 05:57:07	Limada	msx: ¿sabés qué? cuando de la charla sobre bots te voy a dejar tan mal que se te van a reir hasta en Kamchatka.
2013-05-04 05:57:15	msx	Limada: es verdad lo que decis igual, el vasco es por lo general muy derecho con valores estrictos, esta marcado geneticamente
2013-05-04 05:57:26	Limada	puede ser.
2013-05-04 05:57:38	msx	me asustas
2013-05-04 05:57:44	Limada	de todas formas me criaron mis abuelos italianos.

2013-05-04 05:59:13	@NEEDMOAR	Debés haber tenido un cursito de un año en la escuela, porque algún viejo radical del pueblo queria que aprendan el idioma choto ese, y le hace gastar recursos al país.

2013-05-04 07:05:18	@the9th	is Dubshinki a japanese name?
2013-05-04 07:05:24	@msx	of course not
2013-05-04 07:05:28	@the9th	what is it
2013-05-04 07:05:32	@the9th	if not jap
2013-05-04 07:05:35	@Spaceghost	msx: igual no me refiero tanto a la barra, sino a la cosa de subir y bajar, al coso de cerrar y minimizar la ventana y demás.
2013-05-04 07:05:36	@msx	that sounds more to polish that jap
2013-05-04 07:05:45	@msx	like polish jew or something like that
2013-05-04 07:06:15	@msx	Spaceghost: esperá, podés modificar los botones a tu gusto
2013-05-04 07:06:25	@msx	sabías? desde el gestor de temas
2013-05-04 07:06:27	@the9th	I thought polish as well, but now I'm having doubts. what is your confidence level on it not being japanese?
2013-05-04 07:06:34	@msx	los podés hacer más grandes
2013-05-04 07:06:37	@shay	doesnt sound jewish
2013-05-04 07:06:42	@shay	maybe as a last name
2013-05-04 07:06:45	@shay	but i still doubt it
2013-05-04 07:06:47	@Spaceghost	shay: what do you use?
2013-05-04 07:07:07	@shay	Spaceghost:'m quite happy with gnome since gnome 3x
2013-05-04 07:07:10	@msx	as a surename, it sounds totally jew polish to me
2013-05-04 07:07:59	@msx	the9th: 100%, i love japan and all related to their culture, i know that dubshinki isn't japanese
2013-05-04 07:08:11	@Spaceghost	msx: en realidad quisiese que todo se volviese más grande, disminuiría la resolución si no se viese feo en mi monitor.

2013-05-04 07:17:22	@msx	te va a evitar muchos dolores de cabeza
2013-05-04 07:17:36	@Spaceghost	Buena idea.

2013-05-04 12:43:59	pwca	and I saw another Muslim colleague refuse to eat bacon crisps that contained no bacon or animal produce whatever.
2013-05-04 12:44:01	Parsi	then he was a kafir
2013-05-04 12:44:14	pwca	these two incidents have made me deeply confused about the teachings of Islam.

2013-05-04 12:49:06	Parsi	pwca: maybe he was allah-
2013-05-04 12:49:21	pwca	hard to say.
2013-05-04 12:49:28	Parsi	I heard he prays 5 times a day
2013-05-04 12:49:29	pwca	he wasn't raping a preteen.
2013-05-04 12:50:02	pwca	and his turban wasn't even remotely bomb-shaped.
2013-05-04 12:50:06	Parsi	and refuses going to holy Jerusalem

2013-05-04 18:39:01	Gennadius	here is an interesting paper arguing that semi-vowels and vowels are not featurally identical, as generativists have argued.
2013-05-04 18:39:03	Gennadius	http://people.ucsc.edu/~padgett/locker/glides07.pdf
2013-05-04 18:40:02	Gennadius	that is, there is more distinguishing vowels and corresponding semivowels than their position in syllable nuclei (for vowels) and syllable boundaries (for semivowels)

2013-05-04 18:41:09	Gennadius	try accessing it from a different country
2013-05-04 18:41:24	Gennadius	sometimes, google books access varies by the country your ip address resolves to
2013-05-04 18:41:24	Bogdan	Google used to allow downloading pre-1923 European books from within the US.
2013-05-04 18:41:36	Gennadius	i noticed that there is more using an australian ip address
2013-05-04 18:41:37	Bogdan	Gennadius, yup, I know.
2013-05-04 18:41:39	Gennadius	and fewer with a german one

2013-05-04 18:42:14	Gennadius	yes, look for proxy servers, or ip spoof
2013-05-04 18:42:26	Bogdan	Gennadius, I was able to see the download button when using one of proxy sites, but it wasn't working because the proxy site didn't allow post requests or something.
2013-05-04 18:42:42	Gennadius	interesting
2013-05-04 18:42:42	Gennadius	well, try using tor perhaps
2013-05-04 18:43:00	Gennadius	and select a node located in a country with more liberal IP protection, like australia
2013-05-04 18:43:20	Bogdan	Gennadius, ah, so there is a way to request what kind of IP I want?
2013-05-04 18:43:29	Gennadius	yes, using tor you can
2013-05-04 18:43:29	@B-rat	anyone know of a boggle game where there's a ringing noise when you finish a round, and also some kind of short music thing just before a round ends
2013-05-04 18:43:52	Gennadius	google around for configuring tor to select nodes by country
2013-05-04 18:44:21	Bogdan	ok, thanks.
2013-05-04 18:45:08	Gennadius	i'm not sure whether google books is better using the UK, but to watch UK t.v. (bbc broadcasts) over the internet, i used to use software called expat shield.
2013-05-04 18:45:21	Gennadius	there is a trial version. it is all preconfigured, but unfortunately the software is proprietary
2013-05-04 18:45:34	@koinlet	NEEDMOAR, because some modules seriously have 2 types defined in it.
2013-05-04 18:45:47	@koinlet	And if you put them in the same file, you can say share imports or other things.
2013-05-04 18:45:58	@koinlet	Another thing is, the runhaskell interpreter for shell scripts
2013-05-04 18:46:05	@koinlet	searches for modules in the current working directory

2013-05-04 19:12:56	Gennadius	the far left is more insightful in this regard, with its analyses of the the in the wealth distribution in america and its critique of globalization. corporate interests are inextricably enmeshed with the government, and an honest analysis of the structures of power would have to also include the ideologies that underpin the contemporary system, and the dissemination of these ideologies in the academy and national media
2013-05-04 19:14:42	Gennadius	(multi-culturalism, pluralistic democracy, the myth of progress and the attendant condemnation of tradition as 'backwards,' pathological niceness in the name of tolerance, socially corrosive sexual values)

2013-05-05 00:50:12	@chabibi	I have a reed pen
2013-05-05 00:50:18	@chabibi	but I did not cut it myself
2013-05-05 00:52:46	Gennadius	most reed pens available at art stores in the west are made from bamboo. i am not sure if they are similar in any way to qalam pen (i would guess not). i picked some reeds out of a ditch earlier in the day and have been trying to cut them with an art knife.
2013-05-05 00:53:01	Gennadius	i think these reeds aren't good because they are fraying

2013-05-05 06:22:16	@NEEDMOAR	qfr_shahiid_and_: it should work like that.

2013-05-05 06:22:52	@qfr_shahiid_and_	Yeah

2013-05-05 06:23:20	@Clint	of course it doesn't
2013-05-05 06:23:30	@qfr_shahiid_and_	Indeed of course, that' s why I can' t use it like that.
2013-05-05 06:23:58	@qfr_shahiid_and_	Haskell is a fucking disaster, 80% of the fucking syntax errors you get are fixed by inserting or removing a tab.
2013-05-05 06:24:17	@Clint	obviously you should switch to ocaml
2013-05-05 06:24:26	@NEEDMOAR	Haha, you should learn the layout rule.
2013-05-05 06:24:36	@qfr_shahiid_and_	How on earth can you learn that
2013-05-05 06:24:43	@qfr_shahiid_and_	the semantics are waaaaaaaaay too complicated.
2013-05-05 06:25:07	@qfr_shahiid_and_	No one really knows them, people just do it right 50% of the time by intuition and it falls apart if you don' t want to use the indentation they want you to use.
2013-05-05 06:25:18	@qfr_shahiid_and_	Like, I like to indent similar functions or special cases of functions
2013-05-05 06:26:07	@qfr_shahiid_and_	Like have maximum = maximumBy (>) indented under maximumBy because it's  a special case.
2013-05-05 06:26:30	@qfr_shahiid_and_	Goes right to some extend but at some points it generates extremely confusing errors if you do that and try to get where and let into it.
2013-05-05 06:27:04	@NEEDMOAR	Maybe it'd be simpler for you if you follow others' way to indent.
2013-05-05 06:27:31	@qfr_shahiid_and_	NEEDMOAR, how do you do this: http://codepad.org/l5jL1FcL
2013-05-05 06:27:43	@qfr_shahiid_and_	Standard indenting rules make no sense with collapsing text editors.
2013-05-05 06:28:09	@no-n	you should use let instead of where on line 5
2013-05-05 06:28:11	@qfr_shahiid_and_	If I have 3 special cases of a function defined under the main one, of course I wanted to indent them a level under the function they are a special case of.
2013-05-05 06:28:23	@qfr_shahiid_and_	no-n, I don' t wanna, I wanna use where here.
2013-05-05 06:28:39	@no-n	why? where is for covering the whole function body
2013-05-05 06:29:18	@no-n	anyway you could just putStrLn $ x ++ x

2013-05-06 11:48:09	@qfr	Which ones
2013-05-06 11:48:16	@kehoea	it's just as colloquial, though
2013-05-06 11:48:30	@kehoea	ok, Irish doesn't
2013-05-06 11:48:52	@kehoea	nor English

2013-05-06 12:02:00	@kehoea	saimazoon, speaking of colloquial and substandard
2013-05-06 12:02:38	@kehoea	the way you express progressive aspect in German is with the construction sein + am + infinitive
2013-05-06 12:02:50	@kehoea	"ich bin am überlegen"
2013-05-06 12:03:00	@kehoea	this is perfectly normal in the standard language
2013-05-06 12:03:01	@saimazoon	same as in european portuguese
2013-05-06 12:03:08	@saimazoon	estou a ler um livro
2013-05-06 12:03:17	@kehoea	various authorities assert that it's regional and non-standard
2013-05-06 12:03:28	@kehoea	so people don't use it in very formal written texts
2013-05-06 12:03:48	@Kartagis	saimazoon: being sterile is no big deal unless you want a child
2013-05-06 12:03:54	@saimazoon	all of the grammars i read said german doesn't make any distinction between aorist and progressive aspectgg
2013-05-06 12:03:59	@Kartagis	even then, there are options
2013-05-06 12:04:07	@saimazoon	Kartagis: i don't want children
2013-05-06 12:04:09	@kehoea	to me, "überlegen" is being used as a noun there, so in theory it should be "ich bin am Überlegen", but no-one really writes that
2013-05-06 12:04:42	@saimazoon	kehoea: do they capitalise infinitives when they're used as nouns?
2013-05-06 12:04:44	@saimazoon	oh, yeah
2013-05-06 12:04:45	@saimazoon	das Leben
2013-05-06 12:05:04	@kehoea	right, saimazoon, but as I say this is perfectly normal in modern standard German, and it expresses progressive aspect in the same way that "I am considering ..." and "estoy considerando" do
2013-05-06 12:05:44	@saimazoon	can you say 'je suis à lire' in french?
2013-05-06 12:05:45	@qfr	kehoea, I never use that construction
2013-05-06 12:05:49	@saimazoon	instead of 'je suis en train de lire'
2013-05-06 12:05:59	@saimazoon	qfr: you're not a representative sample of the german-speaking population
2013-05-06 12:06:00	@qfr	I use "ich bin gerade dabei etwas zu tun"
2013-05-06 12:06:14	@saimazoon	in fact, as i've pointed out several times before, you're not a representative sample for any human group

2013-05-06 12:06:39	@saimazoon	i was joking, qfr
2013-05-06 12:06:48	@qfr	I see, idiot
2013-05-06 12:07:11	@saimazoon	think for a second what outstanding makeup of circumstances could lead to my being exposed to high doses of radiation
2013-05-06 12:07:27	@qfr	saimazoon, this stuff actually happened

2013-05-06 12:19:01	@kehoea	the noun is from the verb, and here's the verb's etymology:

The cognate ON. fremja (= OE. fremman, fremian: see freme v.) to further, execute, perform, may have influenced the development, as it has no umlaut in pa. tense and pa. pple. (framðe, framdr).]

The rest of the procession began killing themselves and others. Women mockingly threw jewelry and gold coins at the troops. The soldiers stripped the corpses of the valuables and sacked the ruins of the burned palace.

2013-05-06 18:59:48	@qfr	Kasuaarit Gennadius I have a linguistic question from earlier
2013-05-06 18:59:53	@B-rat	it's like rhyming slang without the rhyming bit
2013-05-06 19:00:02	@B-rat	so it's like two levels harder to understand
2013-05-06 19:00:18	@Kasuaarit	no, qfr, you shouldn't split your tongue, that only improves the speech of ravens
2013-05-06 19:00:22	@qfr	Greek martyras <-> Arabic shahiid
2013-05-06 19:00:26	@qfr	Is there some connection?
2013-05-06 19:00:26	@Clint	it's like penis slang without the penis bit
2013-05-06 19:00:36	Gennadius	etymological connection, you mean?
2013-05-06 19:00:45	@Kasuaarit	you mean, beyond the obvious semantic connection
2013-05-06 19:00:47	@qfr	Oddly enough they are both used in the sense of witness and also religious sacrifice
2013-05-06 19:01:01	@qfr	I found that very odd
2013-05-06 19:01:13	@qfr	Is that coincidental
2013-05-06 19:01:18	@qfr	Or did they have some exposure
2013-05-06 19:03:23	@Kasuaarit	I don't think so, but I don't know
2013-05-06 19:04:08	@Kasuaarit	though I assume the reasons both words mean both things is because of a related viewpoint
2013-05-06 19:04:34	@Kasuaarit	afaik, martyrs are so called because it referred to people who refused to renounce their faith and were therefore killed
2013-05-06 19:05:12	@Kasuaarit	i.e.
2013-05-06 19:05:15	@Kasuaarit	.w bear witness
2013-05-06 19:05:16	@lingbot	bear witness — verb: 1. To deliver a testimony, especially as witness, 2. To prove, demonstrate
2013-05-06 19:06:15	@Kasuaarit	as for shahid, well, it's the same root as the shahada, right?
2013-05-06 19:06:23	@qfr	Yes
2013-05-06 19:06:26	@Kasuaarit	so maybe it's the same idea, they refused to recant the shahada
2013-05-06 19:06:46	@qfr	Although in Arabic the term is used far more liberally
2013-05-06 19:06:58	@Kasuaarit	which is, shahid?
2013-05-06 19:07:03	@qfr	yes
2013-05-06 19:07:17	@Kasuaarit	well, yeah, it still means witness, so
2013-05-06 19:07:26	@qfr	Firefighter dying doing his job is also called shahiid etc
2013-05-06 19:07:33	@qfr	Even though it's not inherently religious
2013-05-06 19:07:39	@Kasuaarit	it'd be like if english calqued martyr rather than loaning it, then 'witness' would have the two connotations
2013-05-06 19:07:45	@Kasuaarit	oh you mean like that
2013-05-06 19:07:51	@Kasuaarit	yeah, all things are in god, etc
2013-05-06 19:08:49	@Kasuaarit	I'm just coming up with this shit on the fly, though, so if you find out some better explanation I'd love to know
2013-05-06 19:10:15	Gennadius	a lot of christian religious vocabulary has antecedents in the language of law, trade, etc.

2013-05-06 19:40:50	fffree	Kasuaarit, the realisation of the posessive or the partial devoicing?
2013-05-06 19:40:51	@almar	and in the north, people often aspirate these consonants when they are between vowels
2013-05-06 19:41:03	@almar	this is pretty much the only dialectal difference still noticeable in icelandic.
2013-05-06 19:41:15	@Kasuaarit	fffree, I was actually responding to almar; devoicing of nasals next to other obstruents
2013-05-06 19:41:27	@Kasuaarit	it varies dialectally, but
2013-05-06 19:41:28	@almar	interesting
2013-05-06 19:41:31	fffree	oh that intervocalic aspiration is pretty cool almar
2013-05-06 19:41:46	fffree	like the opposite of the old hat that is intervocalic voicing
2013-05-06 19:42:05	fffree	got it Kasuaarit :)

2013-05-07 03:57:08	@Mike_H	Accidentally spending $1 more than usual on Lotto Tickets paid off for a mother of four sons in Orange County to the tune of $14 million.
2013-05-07 03:57:08	@Mike_H	Thuan Le bought her winning SuperLotto Plus last week at a Mission Viejo, Calif., CVS (map), where she typically buys $4 worth of Powerball tickets and $1 on a SuperLotto Plus ticket.
2013-05-07 03:57:16	@Mike_H	When Le noticed she accidentally put $6 into the self-service machine, she took her chances on an extra – would-be winning – SuperLotto Plus ticket.
2013-05-07 03:57:16	@Mike_H	Le checked the winning ticket with her friend. After ticking off the matching numbers one by one, Le was so excited, she ran screaming from the store, according to a news release from California Lottery.
2013-05-07 03:57:16	@Mike_H	A single mother of four sons, Le said she plans to use her winnings to buy a house, travel and visit her parents in Vietnam.

2013-05-07 15:58:10	@qfr	And they will insist on talking to you in English mostly ;l

2013-05-07 19:30:20	DerSChnup	it's a really complex situation now that i think about it
2013-05-07 19:30:26	fffree	So, it's not all lost. Also, I think your approach to laryngeal activity over there is pretty unique among English speakers if I'm not mistaken..
2013-05-07 19:30:49	DerSChnup	because skin color is a very bad indication of who's singaporean
2013-05-07 19:31:02	DerSChnup	people are identified as "local" by their accent
2013-05-07 19:31:07	fffree	:)
2013-05-07 19:31:17	DerSChnup	but then you have to be able to speak standard english in formal contexts too
2013-05-07 19:31:47	DerSChnup	but if you can't speak your "mother tongue" (the official language that matches your skin color) you get teased too
2013-05-07 19:32:09	DerSChnup	either you're "jiak kantang one" (potato-eater) if you only speak english
2013-05-07 19:32:20	DerSChnup	or (in the case of chinese singaporeans) "cheenapok"
2013-05-07 19:33:45	DerSChnup	and among friends, family and relatives you have to speak singlish, because it sounds really odd if i spoke to my parents like the way i'm typing now
2013-05-07 19:34:11	DerSChnup	fffree: anyway, what did you mean by laryngeal activity?
2013-05-07 19:35:35	fffree	Well, like voicing and things

2013-05-07 20:10:02	DerSChnup	they offered me a full-time job last year in feb
2013-05-07 20:10:09	DerSChnup	but they pay sucked so i turned it down
2013-05-07 20:10:10	@Kasuaarit	fffree, youse isn't exclusively northern
2013-05-07 20:10:16	DerSChnup	and moved in with my husband anyway
2013-05-07 20:10:24	DerSChnup	it was really fun
2013-05-07 20:10:39	@Kasuaarit	it appears in cockney, for example
2013-05-07 20:10:43	fffree	Kasuaarit, yeah I know, some midland and ireland use in there
2013-05-07 20:10:46	@Kasuaarit	as well as the other usual suspects
2013-05-07 20:10:46	DerSChnup	*instead not anyway
2013-05-07 20:10:58	fffree	but I've never heard/seen it in anything cockney
2013-05-07 20:11:18	DerSChnup	well singlish uses "you all"
2013-05-07 20:11:21	@Kasuaarit	I think it's still restricted to irish influence, but it's definitely there
2013-05-07 20:11:31	DerSChnup	and sometimes "they all" lol
2013-05-07 20:11:35	fffree	DerSChnup, yeah like AmE y'all
2013-05-07 20:11:44	DerSChnup	actually i've never thought about whether "they all" is different from "they" in singlish
2013-05-07 20:12:18	DerSChnup	it obviously comes from chinese
2013-05-07 20:12:24	fffree	Kasuaarit, hmm.. well who knows it's all mixing more and more, but certainly not a prominent streak in native londoners as far as I'm aware
2013-05-07 20:12:30	DerSChnup	there's also "we all"
2013-05-07 20:12:52	@Kasuaarit	fffree, oh yeah, it's not the usual, but I use it, so :)
2013-05-07 20:13:00	@Kasuaarit	(I'm not a cockney, for clarification)
2013-05-07 20:13:01	fffree	DerSChnup, so do you have exlusive we in Singlish?
2013-05-07 20:13:01	DerSChnup	anyway german needs a 2PERS-PL-FORMAL too
2013-05-07 20:13:20	@Kasuaarit	anyway, I gotta run
2013-05-07 20:13:21	DerSChnup	fffree: i think "we all" can be exclusive
2013-05-07 20:13:22	fffree	Kasuaarit, I heard you're not from here tho?
2013-05-07 20:13:35	DerSChnup	like "we all think you all damn stupid"
2013-05-07 20:13:46	DerSChnup	but it's not used systematically
2013-05-07 20:14:04	fffree	hmm interesting
2013-05-07 20:14:21	DerSChnup	thing is, there's also quite a bit of influence from malay
2013-05-07 20:14:26	DerSChnup	which does have incl/excl pronouns
2013-05-07 20:14:39	fffree	I like the ring of that.. "we all's thinking that you all's so damn stupid maaan"
2013-05-07 20:15:17	fffree	Oh yes! I was told about the tabu of using Malay tag questions in Singapore once..
2013-05-07 20:15:53	DerSChnup	sometimes i'm quite surprised at the sentences i utter, like when my mother was here on holiday and we were in teh supermarket and told me that she wanted milk, so i got her a bottle, but she said no, she wanted hot milk, and i said "where got supermarket sell milk is hot one?!"
2013-05-07 20:16:13	DerSChnup	fffree: really? like what?
2013-05-07 20:16:15	fffree	lol
2013-05-07 20:16:53	fffree	DerSChnup, can't remember precisely. But I lived with Malaysians for a while, and after met a Singaporean (unknowlingly). She said "blah blah, lah" so I got some of those things out
2013-05-07 20:17:05	fffree	and suddenly she was like omg don't do that, its malay and all
2013-05-07 20:17:19	fffree	maybe just I met a racist one
2013-05-07 20:17:33	DerSChnup	lah isn't malay
2013-05-07 20:17:39	DerSChnup	it's "General Singaporean" now lol

2013-05-08 04:18:02	Gennadius	as i see it, Cassowaries, we can either have liberty or equality, not both, and the assumption that in any social configuration we should work on the presupposition that human beings are equal, or that conditions should be manipulated in such a way as to realize equality, is utopian and dangerous

2013-05-08 06:28:14	@zocky	I remember when the cat died. I was really sad, cos we'd had that cat for over 14 years. A lovely cat. Terrified of other people, though, and it was a cross-breed between a domestic short-hair and a long-haired Asian breed, so it was a bit fluffy and left hairs all over the place and careful grooming. It had little white feet and was grey, with blues skin - actual, proper blue skin. It was horrible when it died.
2013-05-08 06:28:14	@zocky	That was a few years ago now, of course. These days I hardly ever think of that cat. These days all I ever think about is anal fisting.

2013-05-08 14:00:34	@qfr	Old English Lucifer "Satan," also "morning star," from Latin Lucifer "morning star," literally "light-bringing," from lux (genitive lucis) "light" (see light (n.)) + ferre "carry" (see infer).
2013-05-08 14:00:34	@qfr	Belief that it was the proper name of Satan began with its use in Bible to translate Greek Phosphoros, which translates Hebrew Helel ben Shahar in Isaiah xiv:12 -- "How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning!" [KJV] Because of the mention of a fall from Heaven, the verse was interpreted by Christians as a reference to Satan, even though it is literally a reference to the King of Baby

2013-05-08 23:36:54	@Mike_HH	SULLIVAN’S ISLAND, SC—Hours after former South Carolina governor Mark Sanford won back his old congressional seat Tuesday, the philandering politician’s ex-wife, Jenny Sanford, told reporters that she couldn’t express enough support for the state’s lenient gun purchasing laws. “It’s just really great to know that in South Carolina, as long as you have a state ID and as little as $50, you can have a loaded, lethal weapon in your hand,
2013-05-08 23:36:54	@Mike_HH	cocked and ready to go in minutes,” said the state’s former first lady.
2013-05-08 23:37:32	@Mike_HH	“There are no concealment laws, and I don’t even have to worry about getting the gun registered. Perfect.” Reporters say Sanford abruptly concluded the interview, saying, “Well, I have to go now.”

2013-05-09 00:04:08	@sytse	I learned a tiny bit of japanese once
2013-05-09 00:04:29	@DerSChnup	saimazoon: i have to admit, since we last spoke i haven't learnt any new languages
2013-05-09 00:04:30	@DerSChnup	=o(
2013-05-09 00:04:40	@DerSChnup	but i did finally manage to complete my  master's!
2013-05-09 00:04:42	@sytse	better at listening than reading; I never got far with reading, but I did learn 2000 characters fairly well a long time ago
2013-05-09 00:04:44	@saimazoon	DerSChnup: 我现在愿意到德国搬家找到一个好的工作

2013-05-09 00:05:10	@DerSChnup	是呀 这里最近一大堆西班牙人
2013-05-09 00:05:14	@sytse	and by 'learn' I mean learn to write, not learn any readings (I only know a fraction of the readings)
2013-05-09 00:05:18	@saimazoon	恭喜，恭喜
2013-05-09 00:05:42	@DerSChnup	你为何不来德国一趟 以你的资格，肯定能找到好工作的

2013-05-09 00:06:53	@DerSChnup	sytse: yeah i learnt some japanese a long time ago too...i can sort of read stuff.. kana makes it easier to tell what POS it is
2013-05-09 00:07:02	@saimazoon	因为我还不可以离这里去国外
2013-05-09 00:07:06	@DerSChnup	and then you can more or less guess
2013-05-09 00:07:19	@saimazoon	可是夏天以后就可以
2013-05-09 00:07:24	@DerSChnup	saimazoon: 为什么呢

2013-05-09 00:08:16	@saimazoon	我事实山还没有毕业:(
2013-05-09 00:08:39	@DerSChnup	你不是早已经有了硕士了吗

2013-05-09 00:09:17	@saimazoon	我打算下月终于毕业
2013-05-09 00:09:29	@sytse	DerSChnup: the litany of chinese readings that are used besides japanese readings rarely causes trouble in practice IME.. you just know, just like you just know how to pronounce or interpret any other language when reading

2013-05-09 00:10:11	@sytse	still, it is kind of tough to learn sometimes DOZENS of readings for one single character..
2013-05-09 00:10:14	@DerSChnup	不过我觉得自己好像白读了7年的书
2013-05-09 00:10:22	@DerSChnup	我也是！
2013-05-09 00:10:32	@saimazoon	对
2013-05-09 00:10:42	@DerSChnup	硕士一般需要两年。。我三年后还没读完 本来想放弃的
2013-05-09 00:10:53	@DerSChnup	可是我丈夫鼓励了我。。
2013-05-09 00:11:03	@DerSChnup	一共花了四年半才读完
2013-05-09 00:11:05	@saimazoon	我已经是大学生七年了
2013-05-09 00:11:09	@sytse	(the craziest shit is names though, japanese people simply have NO way of knowing how to pronounce a name from reading it. It could be anything..)

2013-05-09 00:14:25	@DerSChnup	like i told everyone else
2013-05-09 00:14:38	@DerSChnup	a master's in linguistics is like having a master's in basketweaving
2013-05-09 00:14:49	@DerSChnup	it's as useless as a car with two and a half wheels
2013-05-09 00:15:19	@saimazoon	you said your master's degree feels like it's good for nothing?
2013-05-09 00:15:21	@saimazoon	useless in germany?

2013-05-09 00:15:58	@DerSChnup	no no
2013-05-09 00:16:02	@saimazoon	although it's better to have some money in germany than being unemployed in spain

2013-05-09 00:30:50	@saimazoon	i thought it was a southern chinese dialect
2013-05-09 00:30:50	@DerSChnup	yes it is
2013-05-09 00:30:52	@saimazoon	like hakka or fujian
2013-05-09 00:31:00	@DerSChnup	but it's not used in all contexts
2013-05-09 00:31:02	@DerSChnup	you know
2013-05-09 00:31:07	@saimazoon	yeah
2013-05-09 00:31:07	@DerSChnup	it's like basque or welsh

2013-05-09 00:31:22	@saimazoon	hey, DerSChnup, basque can be easily written down
2013-05-09 00:31:26	@saimazoon	unlike wuyue
2013-05-09 00:31:29	@DerSChnup	so can mandarin
2013-05-09 00:31:42	@DerSChnup	i mean mandarin doens't function on all levels in singapore
2013-05-09 00:31:49	@DerSChnup	like basque is not the language you open a bank account in
2013-05-09 00:31:51	@DerSChnup	same in singapore

2013-05-09 00:32:29	@saimazoon	it is, DerSChnup, where it's spoken
2013-05-09 00:32:46	@DerSChnup	so, you can get a degree in physics
2013-05-09 00:32:48	@saimazoon	of course you wouldn't expect berlin university to teach its math courses in basque
2013-05-09 00:32:50	@DerSChnup	all in basque?
2013-05-09 00:32:54	@saimazoon	i think so
2013-05-09 00:32:55	@DerSChnup	with your thesis written in basque?
2013-05-09 00:32:58	@saimazoon	yeah
2013-05-09 00:33:00	@saimazoon	most probably
2013-05-09 00:33:00	@DerSChnup	i seriously doubt it

2013-05-09 00:33:15	@saimazoon	offers most of its courses in basque
2013-05-09 00:33:20	@saimazoon	i think that's already been done,  DerSChnup
2013-05-09 00:33:23	@saimazoon	for undegraduate textbooks
2013-05-09 00:33:38	@saimazoon	i've seen translationss of computer science books into basque

2013-05-09 00:34:04	@DerSChnup	but functionally it just isn't used on all levels in singapore
2013-05-09 00:34:07	@DerSChnup	unlike in china
2013-05-09 00:34:36	@saimazoon	i understand
2013-05-09 00:34:48	@DerSChnup	saimazoon: it's like talking to monolingual spanish speakers from rural peru
2013-05-09 00:34:52	@DerSChnup	sure they're native speakers
2013-05-09 00:34:53	@saimazoon	i guess that probably owes to the fact that singapure is a former british colony
2013-05-09 00:35:03	@DerSChnup	but they sound a little backward where vocab is concerned
2013-05-09 00:35:06	@saimazoon	monolingual speakers in rural peru don't speak spanish
2013-05-09 00:35:08	@saimazoon	they speak quechua

2013-05-09 00:35:54	@saimazoon	and he said as soon as they get out of big cities, they don't understand a word of what people say
2013-05-09 00:35:56	@saimazoon	even in mandarin speaking areas

2013-05-09 00:36:08	@DerSChnup	and vice versa
2013-05-09 00:36:24	@saimazoon	i guess you don't speak with retroflex consonants
2013-05-09 00:36:28	@DerSChnup	it takes getting used to
2013-05-09 00:37:04	@saimazoon	so, DerSChnup
2013-05-09 00:37:06	@DerSChnup	anyway you know what i mean
2013-05-09 00:37:08	@saimazoon	you want to stay there

2013-05-09 00:38:15	@DerSChnup	1.5-2k for a whole degree
2013-05-09 00:38:17	@saimazoon	sounds like the perfect deal
2013-05-09 00:38:20	@saimazoon	that's very cheap, Dder
2013-05-09 00:38:24	@saimazoon	even cheaper than here
2013-05-09 00:38:26	@DerSChnup	i know
2013-05-09 00:38:32	@DerSChnup	but you have to travel there to take exams and stuff

2013-05-09 00:38:49	@DerSChnup	i'm thinking about it

2013-05-09 02:22:35	Gennadius	i would argue that jews are not men in the conventional sense, since they by their perfidious doctrines separate themselves from the common bond of humanity. judaism proposes that the "jewish soul" is ontologically distinct from that of non-jews, just as the general human soul is distinct from the vital spirit of a beast.
2013-05-09 02:23:14	Gennadius	in the traditional morning prayers, the jew prays first that he was not created a woman, and second, that he was not created as a gentile.

2013-05-09 04:06:21	Gennadius	yes, i do. evolution is plausible, but i disagree with the scientific establishment that evolution is essentially non-directional (and agree with catholic theologians). evolution in nature must be oriented towards ends, i.e., the will of god. teleology is inherent in nature, and non-teleological models of evolution (non-directional) are insufficient

2013-05-09 12:08:47	@Lysandros	(been just googling) The Toba catastrophe theory suggests that a bottleneck of the human population occurred c. 70,000 years ago, proposing that the human population was reduced to perhaps 10,000 individuals[3] when the Toba supervolcano in Indonesia erupted and triggered a major environmental change. The theory is based on geological evidences of sudden climate change and on coalescence evidences of some genes (including mitochondrial DNA, Y-

2013-05-09 17:59:09	Gennadius	american culture is so strongly pro-jewish right now. the prominence of jews at all levels of society, from cultural production (both high and low brow cultures) to finance and the academy, has reached levels exceeding that of the weimar republic

2013-05-09 18:00:47	Gennadius	more or less, PedroB, but things are a little more than "good." as a people, jews have successfully displaced or coopted large members of the traditional white, protestant elite.

2013-05-09 18:14:04	Gennadius	homosexuals really don't matter much. they are intrinsically disordered and suffer from a sort of spiritual sickness. the chance of an individual person being homosexual is really not very significant. they receive an inordinate amount of attention in our cultural discourse. why is that?
2013-05-09 18:14:31	@qfr	Well, estimates vary, around 3-6% or so
2013-05-09 18:14:33	Gennadius	i think that homosexualism is being used as a wedge to cleave people from traditional institutions and mores.

2013-05-09 18:17:14	Gennadius	Allah-: homosexuality is intrinsically disordered because sexuality is directed to the essential purpose of reproduction. the homosexual inclination is not, in itself, sinful, provided one does not voluntarily engage in morbid delectation, etc.
2013-05-09 18:17:48	@Lysandros	this guy's hilarious! he even sounds serious

2013-05-09 18:21:12	Gennadius	i think that there is a broader agenda, and the homosexual is a pawn. homosexuality is distinct from homosexualism, and there are many people who struggle with same sex attraction who nonetheless do not affiliate themselves with the broader agenda of homosexualism
2013-05-09 18:21:13	@Lysandros	it's like those who think women should cover tehir ankles because they get horny

2013-05-09 18:28:44	Gennadius	in the u.s., it is so extreme that it is not uncommon for parents to dress baby boys in military-style camouflage clothing to look manly
2013-05-09 18:29:05	PedroB	lol
2013-05-09 18:29:10	PedroB	that's too much in my opinion
2013-05-09 18:29:24	Gennadius	not only that, PedroB, but as boys grow up and go through adolescence, hormones act up, it is common for them to feel all sorts of sexual feelings. now, they are taught to ask "am I gay?"
2013-05-09 18:29:41	Gennadius	"if i am feeling this way, it must be because i was born gay"

2013-05-09 18:30:33	Gennadius	it is unfair to them that they feel the need to analyze their emotions and their identity so strongly. not everyone who is a gay teenager is a gay adult. reality is difficulty to sort out
2013-05-09 18:31:01	@B-rat	Gennadius, traditional christians were against marriage of any kind

2013-05-09 18:36:16	Gennadius	"Now concerning the thing whereof you wrote to me: It is good for a man not to touch a woman. But for fear of fornication, let every man have his own wife, and let every woman have her own husband."
2013-05-09 18:36:23	Gennadius	1 corinthians 7:1-2
2013-05-09 18:36:30	PedroB	Gennadius: usually talking about gays in a not very positive way here and also talking about religion hurts people around
2013-05-09 18:36:37	@B-rat	Gennadius, i doubt it
2013-05-09 18:37:24	Gennadius	i have homosexual acquaintances, and i never make any conscious effort to offend them. when they ask me, they know where i come from.
2013-05-09 18:37:43	Gennadius	but they ordinarily don't, and i don't ask them what they do. i'd prefer not to know
2013-05-09 18:38:20	PedroB	So touching a woman is a bad thing for the man, but it's better to allow them have a wife than forbidding it altogether, otherwise there will be plenty of fornication around. I see, it's like choosing something bad to avoid something much worse
2013-05-09 18:38:57	Gennadius	touching a woman isn't a bad thing in the context of marriage

2013-05-09 18:42:11	Gennadius	jews today do not represent the diversity of thought, practice, and belief of late second temple judaism
2013-05-09 18:42:44	@qfr	I think there is greater diversity today
2013-05-09 18:43:05	@qfr	Because there are far more Jews today and they are more spread out
2013-05-09 18:43:05	Gennadius	perhaps, but there was considerable change and development, and several dead branches
2013-05-09 18:43:18	@zocky	in any case, both modern judaism and islam are theologically far more advanced than christianity, which is still just a veneer of monotheism plastered over paganism and plain old superstition
2013-05-09 18:43:34	Gennadius	i don't see how that means judaism is more "theologically advanced."
2013-05-09 18:44:06	@qfr	zocky, Judaism was born out of a polytheistic Canaanite religion with some influence of Egyptian and Mesopotamian lore
2013-05-09 18:44:08	Gennadius	christianity took the best from the ancient world, developing a synthesis with middle platonism, pythagoreanism, and roman stoicism
2013-05-09 18:44:11	@zocky	their god isn't a man with a beard who impregnates unsuspecting virgins in his bird form and sends his son to the earth to get nailed to a tree
2013-05-09 18:44:34	@B-rat	judaism has evolved since christianity took a part of it, Gennadius
2013-05-09 18:44:55	@qfr	Islam was born out of Judaism, some Christianity and some pre-Islamic Arabian religion
2013-05-09 18:45:20	Gennadius	indeed, B-rat, and there are many dead strains in judaism: sadducees, essenes, nazirities, hellenic judaism
2013-05-09 18:45:30	Gennadius	how is a purely transcendent god more advanced than an incarnating god? is hindu theology less "advanced"?
2013-05-09 18:45:37	@zocky	yes
2013-05-09 18:46:02	@qfr	?
2013-05-09 18:46:14	Gennadius	i would contest that claim. "pagan" doesn't mean bad. and christianity is less superstitious in character than you suggest.
2013-05-09 18:46:16	@zocky	a purely transcendent god is not necessarily a violation of observed universe
2013-05-09 18:46:16	@qfr	Yeah, I have no idea what zocky is about
2013-05-09 18:46:20	@qfr	on about*
2013-05-09 18:46:20	@zocky	an incarnating god is
2013-05-09 18:46:42	Gennadius	christians took the word "paganus" meaning "country bumpkin" and applied it to those who believed in the old gods, who tended to live out in the countryside
2013-05-09 18:46:44	@zocky	"observed reality" is should say
2013-05-09 18:46:57	@zocky	"i should say" i should say
2013-05-09 18:47:00	@zocky	damn
2013-05-09 18:47:03	@qfr	Gennadius, yes, interestingly enough the same is done in Arabic, by the way
2013-05-09 18:47:08	@qfr	Or so I was told
2013-05-09 18:47:10	@qfr	With kaafir
2013-05-09 18:47:20	@qfr	Which is also used in the sense of peasant/rural person
2013-05-09 18:47:24	@qfr	In some contexts
2013-05-09 18:47:50	@qfr	Outside of the sphere of Islam in the early Islamic history of the Arabian peninsula
2013-05-09 18:47:54	Gennadius	christianity, for much of its early history, was an urban phenomenon that attracted not just the lower classes, but educated people and especially upper-class women who acted as patrons
2013-05-09 18:48:42	@zocky	a purely transcendent god is impossible to disprove, and if you're a sort of person that likes to think that the universe has a purpose, you can believe in one without having to believe things that are contrary to your actual experience
2013-05-09 18:48:52	@qfr	The spread of Christianity from the few Hellenised Jews in the early years to Rome is still puzzling to me
2013-05-09 18:49:03	@qfr	I don't know why it became popular

2013-05-09 18:51:00	Allah-	Gennadius: what do you think about Odyssey, is it just a theatrical play ment to merely entertain us or maybe something more than that?
2013-05-09 18:51:22	@qfr	Like, what as the appeal of Christianity over the traditional Indo-European religions
2013-05-09 18:51:23	DrHasselbacher	theatrical play?
2013-05-09 18:51:56	Gennadius	well, the odyssey was performed
2013-05-09 18:52:03	@zocky	qfr, the theological appeal is that christian god makes less nonsense than pagan gods, and the political appeal was that jesus was the ghandi of his day
2013-05-09 18:52:19	DrHasselbacher	Gennadius, les miserables was turned into a musical
2013-05-09 18:52:22	DrHasselbacher	doesn't mean it's a musicak

2013-05-09 18:52:53	Gennadius	i think theatrical play is sloppy, but "poetic performance" might be better
2013-05-09 18:52:54	@qfr	But how does it
2013-05-09 18:53:14	@qfr	I see no appeal in an abstract monotheistic deity which forbids idols
2013-05-09 18:53:22	@qfr	Over the colourful Indo-European pantheon
2013-05-09 18:53:24	@qfr	TO those people
2013-05-09 18:53:35	@zocky	qfr, why do you think they were stupid?
2013-05-09 18:53:37	Allah-	Gennadius: but do you think it is made to just entertain people?
2013-05-09 18:53:40	@Cassowaries	"their god isn't a man with a beard who impregnates unsuspecting virgins in his bird form and sends his son to the earth to get nailed to a tree"
2013-05-09 18:53:43	@Cassowaries	hahahaha
2013-05-09 18:53:44	@zocky	the science of the day proved that those gods don't exist
2013-05-09 18:53:46	@Cassowaries	+5
2013-05-09 18:54:42	Gennadius	Allah-: i think, beyond just being entertaining, public performance had a significance as a sort of sacred act, transmitting knowledge of a common hero significant to the culture
2013-05-09 18:55:02	@zocky	qfr, religion wasn't just entertainment, it was a pre-scientific attempt to figure out reality
2013-05-09 18:55:18	@Cassowaries	qfr, I think it's possible a lot of early roman christians had a different conception of a christian god than the religion itself proclaimed
2013-05-09 18:55:22	Gennadius	and i think that, beyond just having significance to that culture, the odyssey remains something of enduring, human significance
2013-05-09 18:55:37	@qfr	Cassowaries, different how?
2013-05-09 18:55:43	@Cassowaries	by which I mean, christianity's underground popularity in rome coincided with the popularity of lots of mystery cults
2013-05-09 18:55:51	Gennadius	qfr: i can see why you would say that, but you need to remember that religion/philosophy had been moving in that direction for centuries already
2013-05-09 18:55:52	@qfr	That is true
2013-05-09 18:55:55	@Cassowaries	most of which were henotheistic, not exclusive
2013-05-09 18:56:01	@Cassowaries	so I think the appeal was probably the same
2013-05-09 18:56:13	Gennadius	the "god of the philosophers" was already quite abstracted from traditional religion
2013-05-09 18:56:22	@Cassowaries	presumably once they became indoctrinated and attached to the religion, their attitudes changed
2013-05-09 18:57:19	Gennadius	old forms lost their significance. read cicero to see how stories like the founding of rome are met with a degree of incredulity, and nobody of intellectual merit believes in omens by reading animal guts or flocks of birds anymore
2013-05-09 18:57:19	@qfr	What social classes did the Roman mystery religions target?
2013-05-09 18:57:21	@Cassowaries	but yeah, as Gennadius says, educated classes were probably already interested in the idea of a prime mover
2013-05-09 18:57:22	@qfr	Was it an upper class thing?
2013-05-09 18:57:27	@qfr	Or did that depend on the mystery?
2013-05-09 18:57:38	Gennadius	i wouldn
2013-05-09 18:57:46	Gennadius	i wouldn't emphasize mystery religions exclusively
2013-05-09 18:57:53	Gennadius	there were other quasi-religious philosophical sects
2013-05-09 18:58:01	@Cassowaries	that's a fair point
2013-05-09 18:58:06	Gennadius	like epicureanism, which even reached out to slaves
2013-05-09 18:58:21	@BadAtom	qfr: originally christianity drew slaves, women and lower-working class rabble, later it became trendy with patricians and de rigeur once the emperor became associated with it
2013-05-09 18:58:40	@BadAtom	basically the same pattern as every popular trend

2013-05-09 19:00:00	@Cassowaries	though popular philosophers could circulate their ideas quite widely, especially shocking ones
2013-05-09 19:00:03	@qfr	zocky, ah, that's a good point, it might have been the first smaller movement that preached religious exclusiveness
2013-05-09 19:00:10	@qfr	Which was a pretty novel concept I think
2013-05-09 19:00:11	@Cassowaries	but that was more the case in classical and roman greece
2013-05-09 19:00:26	Gennadius	BadAtom: you also need to take into account the jews
2013-05-09 19:00:27	@zocky	well, they did claim to have the whole truth and the only truth
2013-05-09 19:00:27	@qfr	Traditionally most religions were highly syncretic
2013-05-09 19:00:42	@zocky	which made them less wishy washy than other things popular at the time
2013-05-09 19:00:50	Gennadius	BadAtom: christianity was successful in the hellenic jewish context, and jews were widespread throughout the Mediterranean world
2013-05-09 19:00:56	@qfr	And didn't have rules along the lines of "all other gods are bollocks"
2013-05-09 19:01:15	Gennadius	qfr: it wasn't "all other gods are bollocks"
2013-05-09 19:01:15	@qfr	In particular not in south/east Asia
2013-05-09 19:01:19	@zocky	qfr, that wasn't a very very old tradition at the time though

2013-05-09 19:01:49	Gennadius	you can see old statues that christians knocked down and carved with crosses
2013-05-09 19:02:02	@qfr	Actually, I don't recall the Old nor the New Testament saying that the other deities do not exist

2013-05-09 19:14:44	@Spaceghost	Which maybe is fine.
2013-05-09 19:14:45	Gennadius	i am not sure, qfr. if the man uses his virile member in such a way that the seed is not planted within the female pudenda, it is illegitimate
2013-05-09 19:14:45	@B-rat	tonik, why not
2013-05-09 19:14:53	@zocky	Gennadius, disgust is a natural reaction to many things. But, nature, Mr. Alnut, is what we're put in this world to rise above.
2013-05-09 19:14:59	tonik	B-rat, because it's a girl with a penis
2013-05-09 19:15:00	Gennadius	perhaps it would be acceptable to insert first into the anus, then finish in the vagina
2013-05-09 19:15:12	@qfr	Well, I suppose you could extract the semen from the anus later and place it in the vagina
2013-05-09 19:15:20	@qfr	A type of biblical felching

2013-05-09 19:31:20	Gennadius	The results showed that the appropriately trained sexologists were  able to correctly infer vaginal orgasm through watching the way the  women walked over 80 percent of the time. Further analysis revealed that  the sum of stride length and vertebral rotation was greater for the  vaginally orgasmic women. "This could reflect the free, unblocked  energetic flow from the legs through the pelvis to the spine," the  authors note.

2013-05-09 21:47:43	@Clint	there was only one funder of zionism?
2013-05-09 21:47:46	@qfr	I know that album
2013-05-09 21:47:51	@qfr	At least the first track sounds familiar

2013-05-09 21:48:16	@qfr	No, I know it back from like 2005 or 2006
2013-05-09 21:48:29	deadside	oh

2013-05-09 21:48:56	Gennadius	kristallnacht was only of marginal importance. the actual loss of life and the extent of property destruction was marginal in comparison to what has occurred historically, or even more recently, as in the case of greeks in constantinople in the 1950s
2013-05-09 21:49:20	@qfr	Gennadius, I believe you want to mention the terrorist bombing of Dresden

2013-05-09 21:50:35	Gennadius	of course, qfr, it was terrorism. it was the deliberate targeting of civilians in order to destroy their resolve. my sympathies are entirely with the dead, and those who keep their memory alive despite the hatred coming from the antifa crowd

2013-05-09 22:11:25	@Gennadius	bolshevism was a far graver historical menace than ethnic german nationalism could had proven. going to war to restrain german expansion seems a bit silly, and a horrible waste of life for british soldiers and civilians

2013-05-09 22:11:59	@Gennadius	especially since it wasn't really all that expansive for expansion. there were hundred of thousands of germans living under polish rule

2013-05-10 01:56:01	PedroB	almar: and you can choose wheter you want to use part of that money to contribute to get a pension in the future
2013-05-10 01:56:15	@almar	and you make 4 dollars a day
2013-05-10 01:56:18	@almar	?
2013-05-10 01:56:23	DerSChnup	saimazoon: yeah well it's different in germany, if you didn't study exactly the right course you often don't get the job
2013-05-10 01:56:36	DerSChnup	like i have a master's in linguistics, and everyone turns me down as a translator

2013-05-10 01:57:33	DerSChnup	yeah true

2013-05-10 01:57:46	@almar	is the EU gonna fail?
2013-05-10 01:57:53	DerSChnup	but it'd be really hard to get the job

2013-05-10 01:58:30	DerSChnup	nothing's really changed
2013-05-10 01:58:37	PedroB	almar: that's around R$ 2400 per month, working 8 hours a day during 20 days. According to statistics, people need here around R$ 2200 month income to have a decent life

2013-05-10 02:19:01	DerSChnup	Gennadius: that's just the remnants of post-WWII guilt

2013-05-10 02:19:26	@saimazoon	PedroB: my parents were a remarkable exception in terms of fertility rate
2013-05-10 02:19:30	@saimazoon	they had three children
2013-05-10 02:19:43	@almar	i didn't know people knew her
2013-05-10 02:19:53	@BadAtom	saimazoon: and how many of them were human?
2013-05-10 02:19:53	@saimazoon	but most people of my same age are either single children or had just another sibling
2013-05-10 02:19:58	@Gennadius	DerSChnup: that guilt was planted there by the occupation, which propagated a myth of collective guilt in order to further neuter the german nation
2013-05-10 02:19:59	DerSChnup	Gennadius: the czechs drove almost 3.5 ethnic germans out of what is currently the czech republic. most of them had been living there since the 10 century or so

2013-05-10 02:20:29	@saimazoon	Spaceghost: less than you are
2013-05-10 02:20:39	DerSChnup	and there was never a provision for reinstatement... instead they passed laws legitimizing the exile
2013-05-10 02:20:44	@Spaceghost	Thank you.
2013-05-10 02:20:48	PedroB	saimazoon: in Brazil it's like that too, but I guess that it's more common to have two or one siblings. Rarely we see single children around
2013-05-10 02:20:56	@Spaceghost	But that sounds like a suggestion to point to another place.
2013-05-10 02:21:10	DerSChnup	Gennadius: even today there's always police patrols around synagogues in germany
2013-05-10 02:21:12	PedroB	and I'm talking about the middle class, the poor people usually have 5-6 children
2013-05-10 02:21:13	@saimazoon	PedroB: i'm 27 and i don't know anybody of my same age who's got any children
2013-05-10 02:21:36	@almar	I know like 10 people in Iceland around my age who are either expecting a baby or have a small one already
2013-05-10 02:21:38	@Spaceghost	saimazoon: la gente me hace sentir como alguien atractivo.
2013-05-10 02:21:38	@almar	and I'm 21
2013-05-10 02:21:39	@saimazoon	and this is the age most people in our parents' generation were already through their second son
2013-05-10 02:21:43	@Gennadius	saimazoon: you are right, it is financially unsound in the u.s. for a married couple to have children. but a low-income woman who lives alone and "goes to school," even if it is just signing up and flunking community college classes, has every incentive to have one or more children, in order to collect more benefits
2013-05-10 02:21:44	PedroB	I think that the fertility rate in Brazil is ok
2013-05-10 02:21:51	@Spaceghost	Mi problema es que soy un paria de la sociedad.
2013-05-10 02:21:52	DerSChnup	saimazoon: it's true, only the poor people living off welfare have children in germany before they turn 30
2013-05-10 02:21:57	DerSChnup	or even consider having children before they turn 30

2013-05-10 02:22:51	@saimazoon	PedroB: you don't do that accidentally
2013-05-10 02:22:53	@Gennadius	DerSChnup: consider that values are transmitted across generations in the household. the lack of middle-class reproduction necessarily means a proportional reduction in middle-class culture in the future

2013-05-10 02:26:05	@SkEmO	12 or 13?
2013-05-10 02:26:23	@Gennadius	i think there have been identical twin studies on intelligence, saimazoon

2013-05-10 02:27:27	DerSChnup	in any case, multiple studies have shown that children growing up in low-income families in germany have a much lower chance of getting a decent education and a good job afterwards
2013-05-10 02:27:33	PedroB	in the brazilian culture 22 is the number of crazy people and 24 for gay people

2013-05-10 02:27:54	@Gennadius	in china, for example, there is a long history of downward social mobility for men, with the poorest not even reproducing at all. but the richest men kept many wives and concubines

2013-05-10 02:36:27	@almar	I'm probably whiter
2013-05-10 02:36:38	@Gennadius	i wondered because you mentioned how poor your place of origin was, PedroB
2013-05-10 02:36:45	DerSChnup	it's usually subtle but it's unmistakable
2013-05-10 02:36:49	@Gennadius	i figured "very poor, so maybe black"

2013-05-10 02:39:44	DerSChnup	almar: do you ever miss iceland?
2013-05-10 02:40:10	PedroB	I think that I wouldn't stand winter or snow either

2013-05-10 02:42:30	@Gennadius	i really like fahrenheit. even though it is silly, one degree fahrenheit is about the smallest temperature difference that humans can distinguish

2013-05-10 02:43:07	@saimazoon	do you ever witness racism against niggers and muslims in berlin?
2013-05-10 02:43:10	@almar	and change it to the single state of Icey

2013-05-10 02:44:13	@Gennadius	i have mixed opinions about the possibility of turkey joining the e.u.

2013-05-10 02:44:37	@Gennadius	i think it would lead to improved human rights in turkey, where there are a lot of problems
2013-05-10 02:44:39	DerSChnup	Gennadius: why? we have countries like hungary violating freedom of the press

2013-05-10 02:56:41	@saimazoon	yeah
2013-05-10 02:56:43	@saimazoon	i guess so
2013-05-10 02:57:06	@saimazoon	DerSChnup: what don't they
2013-05-10 02:57:07	DerSChnup	Gennadius: y'know, if people evaded taxes more, they could spend more and help revive the economy!
2013-05-10 02:57:08	@saimazoon	do they really care
2013-05-10 02:57:31	@saimazoon	i mean do they rub it all over your face that they'd rather you go back home and stop spoiling their aryan landscape with your gooky face
2013-05-10 02:57:53	DerSChnup	saimazoon: yup
2013-05-10 02:57:58	DerSChnup	well not as much to asians
2013-05-10 02:57:59	@Gennadius	i don't think that government allocates resources in the most efficient way possible (quite the opposite), so tax evasion really doesn't bother me that much.
2013-05-10 02:58:00	@saimazoon	they do?
2013-05-10 02:58:06	DerSChnup	but there's a lot of animonisty towards arabs and turks
2013-05-10 02:58:15	DerSChnup	or anyone who looks like them, like greeks and albanians
2013-05-10 02:58:22	DerSChnup	and black people
2013-05-10 02:58:29	@Gennadius	albanians look turkish to you?
2013-05-10 02:58:30	DerSChnup	blacks are treated terribly here
2013-05-10 02:58:43	DerSChnup	Gennadius: germans can't tell the difference
2013-05-10 02:59:09	DerSChnup	Gennadius: can you tell the difference between singaporeans and koreans?
2013-05-10 02:59:16	DerSChnup	or mongolians and kazakhs?
2013-05-10 02:59:40	DerSChnup	http://alllooksame.com/
2013-05-10 02:59:58	@saimazoon	DerSChnup: how do you pick up on that racism
2013-05-10 03:00:09	PedroB	DerSChnup: terribly like what?
2013-05-10 03:00:09	@saimazoon	is is something you see yourself going on every day in your life
2013-05-10 03:00:24	PedroB	I don't see much racism in Brazil
2013-05-10 03:00:26	DerSChnup	PedroB: refused service or everyone avoids them on the train
2013-05-10 03:00:37	PedroB	even though the government and authorities moan about it
2013-05-10 03:00:53	@Gennadius	DerSChnup: can you identify koreans by appearance?
2013-05-10 03:00:56	PedroB	avoids them? in which sense? they never sit next to them or something?
2013-05-10 03:01:04	DerSChnup	sometimes old people come onto the train and start yammering away about how there're so many foreigners mooching off state welfare
2013-05-10 03:01:40	@saimazoon	old people are fucking lame and mediocre almost everywhere
2013-05-10 03:01:43	DerSChnup	or on the train -- it doesn't happen often -- where someone comes in and sees a black man and says "hey nigger get up! i want to sit there!"
2013-05-10 03:02:04	@saimazoon	DerSChnup: they do the same thing in spain, even though half of them live off 500€-a-month state pensions
2013-05-10 03:02:14	@saimazoon	and perhaps all their kids and grandchildren are jobless

2013-05-10 03:02:47	PedroB	Funny, In Brazil we didn't have segregation like in the US

2013-05-10 03:03:04	PedroB	the best friend of the brazilian emperor for example was himself a black person
2013-05-10 03:03:32	@Gennadius	DerSChnup: can you tell the difference?
2013-05-10 03:03:35	@Mike_H	DerSChnup: ancient Chinese secret!

2013-05-10 03:04:29	@Gennadius	maybe i don't have good enough eyes
2013-05-10 03:04:31	DerSChnup	or a finn from a white american
2013-05-10 03:04:52	@Gennadius	finns look a bit off to me, based on pics i've seen of them. scandinavians have funny noses
2013-05-10 03:05:56	@Mike_H	Finns have weird eyes
2013-05-10 03:06:55	DerSChnup	Gennadius: if you have weird eyes, maybe you have finn ancestry!
2013-05-10 03:07:31	@Gennadius	it's plausible. i have ancestors from sweden on my father's side
2013-05-10 03:08:08	@Gennadius	my most noticeable facial feature, though, is my long, hooked nose, like an eagle's beak

2013-05-10 07:53:18	Gennadius	here's what oed says about english "servant"
2013-05-10 07:53:21	Gennadius	  In the 14th and 15th c. often used to render the Latin servus slave. In all the Bible translations from Wyclif to the Revised Version of 1880–4, the word very often represents the Hebrew ʿébed or the Greek δοῦλος, which correspond to slave, though this term as applied to Israelitish conditions would perh. be misleading.  servant of servants: a Hebraism for one in the most degrading bondage.

2013-05-10 07:54:11	@Bucketphase	that is some pretty degrading bondage
2013-05-10 07:54:41	@BadAtom	in the greek and roman classical civilizations slaves and servants were carefully distinguished from one another
2013-05-10 07:55:15	@Bucketphase	they're clearly different

2013-05-10 07:56:29	@BadAtom	they have to go out to tea-shops and share tables with the common rabble

Because loans are collected through the UK tax system, there is no efficacious system of collecting them from eligible non-UK students who have returned to their home country (mostly in the EU) and the Student Loan Company has never attempted to sue through a foreign court for the money they are owed. In January 2012, more than 45% of such loans were in arrears and apparently had been effectively w

2013-05-10 15:20:05	@Gennadius	i am, mostly
2013-05-10 15:20:08	@tony	Lysandros: mostly yes
2013-05-10 15:20:24	@B-rat	what about medical research, tony
2013-05-10 15:20:41	@tony	B-rat: why would it be different from other research?
2013-05-10 15:20:52	@Gennadius	government creates moral hazard, emphasizing those projects that appeal to bureaucrats sitting on grant committees, and not necessarily knowledge that is worthy
2013-05-10 15:20:53	@B-rat	mainly because then most people cant afford cancer treatment
2013-05-10 15:21:07	@Lysandros	just because it's public money it doesn't mean it's a waste of money
2013-05-10 15:21:34	@tony	B-rat: so we are talking of
2013-05-10 15:21:40	@tony	funding healthcare
2013-05-10 15:21:41	@tony	not research
2013-05-10 15:21:50	@B-rat	essentially the same thing there
2013-05-10 15:21:54	@tony	1. it is not
2013-05-10 15:21:58	@B-rat	how is it not
2013-05-10 15:22:07	@Gennadius	for example, breast cancer is a particularly emotive subject, due to the intimate nature of breasts, but it receives disproportionately far more money than it should based on the statistical likelihood of someone dying from it
2013-05-10 15:22:09	@tony	B-rat: i don't think most people get that
2013-05-10 15:22:16	@B-rat	that's why i'm asking
2013-05-10 15:22:21	@Lysandros	I just don't buy the bullshit that medical research will always aim for the greater good because they will work on what benefits the most
2013-05-10 15:22:21	@tony	get that
2013-05-10 15:22:27	@tony	having a public funding of healthcare
2013-05-10 15:22:33	@tony	is exactly the same thing of having insurance
2013-05-10 15:22:36	@Lysandros	by the way, Gennadius, why are you still talking? didn't we have enough of you yesterday?

2013-05-10 15:24:03	@spectre	<Gennadius> for example, breast cancer is a particularly emotive subject, due to the intimate nature of breasts, but it receives disproportionately far more money than it should based on the statistical likelihood of someone dying from it

2013-05-10 15:24:21	@B-rat	my approach is human lives shouldnt have to be profitable to be saved, tony
2013-05-10 15:24:22	@tony	was of three hundred orders of magnitude
2013-05-10 15:24:25	@B-rat	categorical imperative
2013-05-10 15:24:34	@tony	easier than the cancer one

2013-05-10 15:24:50	@B-rat	yes
2013-05-10 15:24:52	@tony	and such costs have to be taken from something equally important

2013-05-10 15:25:02	@B-rat	iphones arent equally important

2013-05-10 15:25:26	@Gennadius	i don't even think insurance is ideal. i think there should be a pay-as-you-go sort of system to work against the rising costs; incentives must be created to not use healthcare services unless genuinely needful, and those who use them the most should incur costs.

2013-05-10 15:29:10	@Gennadius	there is a free-rider problem, and the problem of moral hazard. if you can consume as much healthcare as you want, without having to pay for this use, why shouldn't you?
2013-05-10 15:29:15	@B-rat	tony, because someone not getting their icecream is less important than someone dying

2013-05-10 15:32:53	@zocky	do you use them?
2013-05-10 15:32:54	@B-rat	Gennadius, and they shouldnt be
2013-05-10 15:32:57	@zocky	do you drive your car on them?
2013-05-10 15:33:10	@Gennadius	which means that poor people without insurance, including noncitizens, simply go to the emergency room for minor complaints like stomachaches
2013-05-10 15:33:12	@zocky	do people that don't own cars pay taxes that get used on roads, among other things?
2013-05-10 15:33:15	@tony	zocky: yes, and i paid and still pay a huge fee cause the government obliges me to have them

2013-05-10 15:35:29	@zocky	tony, there are streets where cars aren't allowed to drive
2013-05-10 15:35:39	@tony	zocky: ok, let's agree on what we are talking
2013-05-10 15:35:44	@zocky	and in most places, streets, unlike roads, are heavily used by pedestrians
2013-05-10 15:35:45	@tony	i'm talking of roads (?)
2013-05-10 15:35:51	@Gennadius	treatment took 1 min. with forceps.  $600
2013-05-10 15:36:00	@spectre	Gennadius, bargain lol
2013-05-10 15:36:02	@Gennadius	insurance didn't cover it
2013-05-10 15:36:08	@zocky	tony, what about people who use public transport?
2013-05-10 15:36:14	@zocky	they don't pay road taxes
2013-05-10 15:36:16	@spectre	Gennadius, in the EUSSR it would have cost you $0
2013-05-10 15:36:28	@tony	zocky: and?
2013-05-10 15:36:32	@tony	zocky: troll harder
2013-05-10 15:36:33	@spectre	because it is covered through general taxation
2013-05-10 15:36:34	@Gennadius	i don't even know how i got a tick in my ear. i was not hiking in the woods
2013-05-10 15:36:38	@B-rat	spectre, except in taxes
2013-05-10 15:36:42	@Gennadius	i was admiring trees in an arboretum that day
2013-05-10 15:36:46	@tony	cause even if you had education if a 3rd world country ruled by some wannabe castro
2013-05-10 15:36:51	@Gennadius	a well-maintained garden
2013-05-10 15:36:52	@tony	i can hardly imagine you are so limited
2013-05-10 15:37:04	@Gennadius	i imagine the tick fell from a tree into my hair and then crawled to my ear
2013-05-10 15:37:05	@zocky	tony, it's idiotic trying to figure out who uses or doesn't use, or should or shouldn't pay, for a public resource
2013-05-10 15:37:16	@tony	zocky: it is not.
2013-05-10 15:37:18	@tony	it's 2013
2013-05-10 15:37:18	@zocky	that's why we have taxes and everybody pays, and everybody can use if they want
2013-05-10 15:37:27	@zocky	so what?
2013-05-10 15:37:33	@tony	so you can easily measure who uses what
2013-05-10 15:37:40	@Gennadius	zocky: there is the free-rider problem. people who don't use or under-use services will be paying for the minority of users who use it a lot
2013-05-10 15:37:40	@zocky	i still don't want to have a whole accounting logic for crossing the street
2013-05-10 15:37:42	@tony	and where it is counter-economic to make such a distinction
2013-05-10 15:37:44	@zocky	same as in 1980

2013-05-10 15:39:57	@Gennadius	in the u.s.
2013-05-10 15:40:00	@zocky	tony, depends where

2013-05-10 15:40:13	@zocky	tony, e.g. in slovenia, most shows are for school children
2013-05-10 15:40:19	@tony	i'm sure it is full of such people
2013-05-10 15:40:31	@spectre	<tony> "Hi I'm john, i was breaking stones till 6PM, then i came to listen to Verdi"
2013-05-10 15:40:32	@spectre	haha
2013-05-10 15:40:52	@Gennadius	it SHOULD be, tony. our culture should restore amateurism and a widespread admiration of excellence and learning
2013-05-10 15:41:05	@tony	Gennadius: opera and ballet are expensive
2013-05-10 15:41:07	@tony	we have registrations
2013-05-10 15:41:13	@zocky	tony, again, depends where
2013-05-10 15:41:14	@Gennadius	yes, i am aware
2013-05-10 15:41:15	@tony	which are tons of times more cost-effective
2013-05-10 15:41:23	@tony	for "educating the kids"
2013-05-10 15:41:30	@zocky	just because something is done badly in italy, doesn't mean it has to be done badly everywhere
2013-05-10 15:41:34	@tony	i love caviar, i still would have problems making a point at the parliament
2013-05-10 15:41:39	@zocky	opera isn't particularly expensive here
2013-05-10 15:41:41	@tony	that they should subside caviar
2013-05-10 15:41:42	@Gennadius	i know of a respected academic who can't even afford to go (although he wants to) because he has 3 kids in private school and a stay-at-home wife, tony
2013-05-10 15:41:47	@zocky	i never go there, cause I don't like opera
2013-05-10 15:41:54	@zocky	but I could easily afford it if I wanted
2013-05-10 15:41:58	@Gennadius	so he makes sacrifice
2013-05-10 15:41:58	@tony	zocky: opera in italy is in a great shape
2013-05-10 15:42:14	@tony	the working class paid my ticket for 20 years
2013-05-10 15:42:29	@zocky	yes, and you paid there health insurance
2013-05-10 15:42:30	@B-rat	i've seen plenty of nice theater productions
2013-05-10 15:42:31	@zocky	everybody wins
2013-05-10 15:42:35	@tony	i'm hoping that the left is gonna subside caviar and dom perignon soon
2013-05-10 15:42:35	@zocky	why are you complaining?
2013-05-10 15:42:35	@Gennadius	there is a book i want to read:
2013-05-10 15:42:48	@tony	cause i think that masses should be introduced
2013-05-10 15:42:48	@Gennadius	"The Intellectual Life of the British Working Classes" by Jonathan Rose
2013-05-10 15:42:55	@Gennadius	http://www.socialismtoday.org/67/culture.html
2013-05-10 15:42:55	@tony	to the joy and haute-ness
2013-05-10 15:42:57	@Gennadius	here is a review
2013-05-10 15:42:58	@tony	of caviar + champagne
2013-05-10 15:43:02	@tony	why is it just for rich people
2013-05-10 15:43:05	@tony	???!?111?
2013-05-10 15:43:08	@tony	WAKE UP PEOPLE
2013-05-10 15:43:11	@Gennadius	"AT ONCE fascinating and infuriating, this book aims to debunk a widespread myth about culture: that the ‘great works’ of intellectual or creative merit have been produced for and consumed exclusively by the ruling classes, whilst the workers have only ever been interested in cheap, escapist trash."
2013-05-10 15:43:20	@zocky	tony, well, I agree, and so those resources should be nationalized and sold at affordable prices
2013-05-10 15:43:25	@B-rat	i dont get why people like caviar
2013-05-10 15:43:26	@tony	yes
2013-05-10 15:43:30	@B-rat	it tastes like dirt to me
2013-05-10 15:43:32	@B-rat	and not in a good way
2013-05-10 15:43:33	@tony	let's nationalize caviar
2013-05-10 15:43:37	@Gennadius	i hate the taste of alcohol
2013-05-10 15:43:48	@Gennadius	i cook with wine but do not drink it
2013-05-10 15:43:54	@tony	also veuve cliqot possibly
2013-05-10 15:43:59	@zocky	tony, it may come as surprise to you, but in most of europe, wildlife is already nationalized
2013-05-10 15:44:01	@tony	then you will realize that they make like 300.000 bottles per year
2013-05-10 15:44:14	@tony	and you will have problems splitting them in 7.000.000.000 people
2013-05-10 15:44:29	@Gennadius	good caviar used to come from the u.s.!
2013-05-10 15:44:39	@tony	come spectre, here you got your 1/25 of shot of champagne
2013-05-10 15:44:41	@zocky	so you're saying only 300,000 bottles of champagne are drunk in total in the world?
2013-05-10 15:44:44	@tony	gently offered by the minister of good taste
2013-05-10 15:44:56	@zocky	or are you using "champagne" in its trademarked meaning?
2013-05-10 15:45:01	@Gennadius	the russian caviar industry took off after fish stocks of sturgeon were almost entirely depleted in north america
2013-05-10 15:45:12	@tony	zocky: i don't want "bubbly wine"
2013-05-10 15:45:17	@tony	i want crystal rose
2013-05-10 15:45:20	@zocky	so you don't acutally mean "champagne" but "champagne that is legally allowed to be branded as champagne"
2013-05-10 15:45:23	@tony	gonna tell you how many bottles we got
2013-05-10 15:45:23	@spectre	tony, i drink moët & chandon
2013-05-10 15:45:29	@zocky	regardless of its quality
2013-05-10 15:45:33	@tony	spectre: cause you are a cheap lad
2013-05-10 15:45:37	@Gennadius	sodastream + zima = champagne
2013-05-10 15:45:38	@spectre	lol
2013-05-10 15:45:38	@tony	but don't worry
2013-05-10 15:45:46	@tony	when zocky will take power
2013-05-10 15:45:50	@spectre	tony, they're under royal warrant
2013-05-10 15:45:51	@tony	he will multiply good champagne
2013-05-10 15:45:54	@tony	like jesus did
2013-05-10 15:46:02	@tony	you bring him water
2013-05-10 15:46:06	@tony	and puff, Crystal
2013-05-10 15:46:09	@Gennadius	i don't think jesus turned water into effervescent wine, tony
2013-05-10 15:46:17	@zocky	tony, are you saying that the only good champagne comes from champagne, and all other sparking wine is shit?
2013-05-10 15:46:18	@zocky	or what?
2013-05-10 15:46:21	@tony	Gennadius: i think it was flat wine
2013-05-10 15:46:28	@zocky	is there a shortage of good champagne?
2013-05-10 15:46:34	@tony	zocky: it seems so
2013-05-10 15:46:35	@Gennadius	jesus was a jew, so it was manischewitz kosher wine
2013-05-10 15:46:42	@tony	since good champagne costs a shitload of money
2013-05-10 15:46:44	@zocky	shops are full of it here, and at not very punitive prices
2013-05-10 15:46:49	@Gennadius	made with concord grapes
2013-05-10 15:46:51	@tony	i would expect it to be much more rare than
2013-05-10 15:46:52	@tony	let's say
2013-05-10 15:46:53	@tony	bread
2013-05-10 15:47:03	@zocky	yes, but it's not ultra rare
2013-05-10 15:47:08	@zocky	nor ultra expensive
2013-05-10 15:47:12	@Gennadius	do you euros even get jew jokes like that?
2013-05-10 15:48:01	@zocky	Gennadius, no, we're perplexed why american tv shows claim that there are five major world religions instead of 4, and why they count judaism as one of them
2013-05-10 15:48:36	@Gennadius	as an american, i am tired of references to "our judeo-christian tradition"
2013-05-10 15:48:47	@zocky	it's a minority religion among one ethnicity

2013-05-10 15:50:14	@zocky	why not up it to nuclear war heads?
2013-05-10 15:50:20	@zocky	and complain that you can't get them?
2013-05-10 15:50:20	@tony	that's my question
2013-05-10 15:50:26	@tony	why not up to nuclear war heads
2013-05-10 15:50:46	@tony	why caviar yes
2013-05-10 15:50:48	@tony	champagne yes
2013-05-10 15:50:58	@zocky	maybe because most people would rather kill you than allow you to have a nuclear warhead
2013-05-10 15:50:59	@tony	and no prostitutes, what kind of socialist dream are you setting up
2013-05-10 15:51:56	@zocky	anyway, the stuff you're talking about is expensive because it's (mostly artificially) scarce
2013-05-10 15:51:56	@Gennadius	i never tried real sturgeon caviar
2013-05-10 15:52:02	@Gennadius	but i like roe of all kinds
2013-05-10 15:52:04	@zocky	e.g. diamonds are not expensive at all
2013-05-10 15:52:07	@tony	zocky: champagne reached its peak
2013-05-10 15:52:17	@zocky	it's just that you can't buy them on a free market
2013-05-10 15:52:21	@Gennadius	right zocky
2013-05-10 15:52:23	@zocky	the exact same is valid for champagne
2013-05-10 15:52:28	@Gennadius	de beers releases only so much at a time. it is a cartel
2013-05-10 15:52:33	@tony	zocky: champagne area is over
2013-05-10 15:52:41	@tony	there is no a single square meter to set up more vineyards
2013-05-10 15:52:42	@Gennadius	and good french wine really isn't THAT expensive
2013-05-10 15:52:54	@zocky	tony, who the fuck cares where the grape grows?
2013-05-10 15:53:01	@zocky	that's artificially making it scarce
2013-05-10 15:53:11	@zocky	distorting the market etc.
2013-05-10 15:53:16	@tony	zocky: wine market is _really_ free
2013-05-10 15:53:20	@zocky	it isn't
2013-05-10 15:53:26	@tony	i mean, if you think champagne and sparkling wine are the same category
2013-05-10 15:53:26	@Gennadius	a portion of french wine every year, even from excellent producing regions, gets distilled into ethyl alcohol for industrial applications
2013-05-10 15:53:28	@zocky	you can't sell champagne unless you're from champagne
2013-05-10 15:53:29	@Gennadius	if you'd believe it
2013-05-10 15:53:39	@tony	you can really get whatever you want
2013-05-10 15:53:43	@tony	from 1€ to 10.000€
2013-05-10 15:53:44	@B-rat	Mike_H, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zP3sffVKbYM
2013-05-10 15:53:47	@zocky	tony, "sparkling wine" was invented when champagne was trademarked
2013-05-10 15:53:54	@zocky	all sparkling wine was called champagne before that
2013-05-10 15:54:02	@tony	zocky: again, you are missing the point
2013-05-10 15:54:05	@Gennadius	anyone here ever drink eiswein?
2013-05-10 15:54:08	@tony	champagne is a brand
2013-05-10 15:54:24	@Gennadius	champagne isn't a brand, it's a region, right?
2013-05-10 15:54:33	@tony	yes, who has a govt recognition
2013-05-10 15:54:34	@tony	like italian DOC
2013-05-10 15:54:43	@tony	basically you can plant the same grapes in myfuckistan
2013-05-10 15:54:48	@tony	follow the same procedure
2013-05-10 15:54:55	@Gennadius	yes, but that's not how plants work
2013-05-10 15:55:06	@Gennadius	there is something called 'terroir'
2013-05-10 15:55:09	@tony	Gennadius: DOC names are made up
2013-05-10 15:55:13	@tony	terroir is bullshit
2013-05-10 15:55:21	@Gennadius	soil, geography, climate
2013-05-10 15:55:32	@Gennadius	no, terroir is real since products vary one year to the next

2013-05-10 15:57:24	@tony	there are good chances a 300€ champagne is better than a 3€ one

2013-05-10 15:57:40	@zocky	my point is, you can get very good "sparkling wine" at a much lower cost than very good "champagne"

2013-05-10 15:57:58	@tony	given a price level
2013-05-10 15:58:06	@tony	usually champagne is better than the italian sparkling wine at the same price
2013-05-10 15:58:10	@Gennadius	real champagne is expensive because of cultural reasons
2013-05-10 15:58:10	@zocky	and the 30€ bottle of champagne that I can buy in my local shop is not nearly 10 times worse than the 300€ bottle of champagne

2013-05-10 17:29:04	@Gennadius	i became very ill around age 12 though and missed my growth spurt
2013-05-10 17:29:24	@qfr	I grew very slowly
2013-05-10 17:29:31	@qfr	I reached my full height around age 19
2013-05-10 17:29:44	@Gennadius	i reached mine at around 15
2013-05-10 17:29:53	@qfr	I was around 160 cm at age 16 I think
2013-05-10 17:30:22	@qfr	Or maybe 170 cm, I can't even remember
2013-05-10 17:30:24	@Gennadius	after i got sick, i grew slowly, then stopped growing soon thereafter
2013-05-10 17:30:30	@qfr	What were yo suffering from
2013-05-10 17:30:50	@Gennadius	lyme borreliosis contracted while camping

2013-05-10 17:33:05	@Gennadius	i was fortunate to have a very good doctor who was aggressive with antibiotic therapy

2013-05-10 17:33:28	@Gennadius	insurance didn't cover all of it, so community members pitched in for me, and it worked.
2013-05-10 17:33:34	@qfr	harsh
2013-05-10 17:34:01	@B-rat	yes i had it for months
2013-05-10 17:34:04	@B-rat	before getting it treated
2013-05-10 17:34:27	@Gennadius	mine went over a year, B-rat .
2013-05-10 17:34:41	@B-rat	did you feel like you were 60
2013-05-10 17:34:47	@Gennadius	yes
2013-05-10 17:34:59	@Gennadius	i was so bad that i had to have one set of books for school, and one set for home
2013-05-10 17:35:04	@Gennadius	because i could not physically carry them
2013-05-10 17:35:17	@B-rat	i was luckily 9
2013-05-10 17:35:21	@B-rat	so i was still full of energy
2013-05-10 17:36:05	@Gennadius	i also couldn't walk very long. one summer, we went to an amusement park, and i had to tell my mother, "I can't walk anymore. I'm sorry." i needed to use a wheelchair to leave
2013-05-10 17:39:32	@Gennadius	again, i was lucky to have a good doctor who disagrees with official treatment guidelines (2 weeks oral antibiotics, and you're cured). after aggressive antibiotic therapy, i was in good health. i can carry 50 lbs in a backpack while hiking without trouble, and walk miles and miles, and i can write without arthritis in my hand
2013-05-10 17:39:44	@Gennadius	it was like going from an old man to young
2013-05-10 17:40:37	@Gennadius	B-rat: from what i've experienced, being an old man sucks

2013-05-10 18:21:28	@Cassowaries	It is counterproductive, even lethal to waste another five decades on meaningless dialogue while we are continuously losing our demographical advantage. We have never and will never be allowed to ever exercise any influence.
2013-05-10 18:21:32	@Cassowaries	The cultural Marxist/multiculturalist elites nationally and in Brussels have for the last five decades created a resilient system whose objective is to ridicule, persecute, harass and silence us. They will continue to systematically marginalize us until the day when we are no longer a threat to them.

2013-05-10 19:37:50	bogdan	it seems that $100k = $65k after taxes in CA, so $5-6k/mo,  $3.5k after rent, $2-something k after food, car and misc = 1500-2000€/mo.
2013-05-10 19:38:02	bogdan	at least from a financial POV, it doesn't worth moving there.
2013-05-10 19:38:32	@zocky	bogdan, is there a point in moving to san francisco and spending 3900$ of your 4000$ wage on basic necessities, as opposed to living in bucarest and spending 200€ of your 300€ wage on basic necessities?

2013-05-10 20:14:37	@zocky	making stuff cheaper
2013-05-10 20:14:44	@spectie	but it would be harder to get the money
2013-05-10 20:15:01	@spectie	because more stuff = more demand
2013-05-10 20:15:02	@zocky	yeah, money more expensive, stuff cheaper
2013-05-10 20:15:16	@spectie	but more people wanting the stuff
2013-05-10 20:15:17	@zocky	money is just numbers
2013-05-10 20:15:57	@zocky	it doesn't matter as long as it's predictable, so that economy doesn't get fucked up, and as long as it's not rigged so that some people get automatical increases on their share of the total amount of money
2013-05-10 20:16:01	@zocky	and it is rigged now
2013-05-10 20:16:48	@spectie	i don't really get how it works
2013-05-10 20:16:58	@spectie	i just want a nice house
2013-05-10 20:17:00	@spectie	and kids
2013-05-10 20:17:02	@zocky	ECB prints new money, out of thin air
2013-05-10 20:17:15	@spectie	and apparently for that you need 'money'
2013-05-10 20:17:19	@zocky	they borrow that money to commercial, mostly private banks at 0.5%
2013-05-10 20:17:26	@zocky	i mean lend
2013-05-10 20:17:30	@spectie	i parsed it
2013-05-10 20:17:42	@zocky	then the banks lend the money to private individuals at somewhat inflated rates
2013-05-10 20:17:45	@spectie	zocky, in my school the kids from the estates had 'borrow' as both 'borrow' and 'lend'
2013-05-10 20:17:50	@zocky	who then buy government bonds at much inflated rates
2013-05-10 20:17:51	@spectie	"borrow me a pencil"
2013-05-10 20:18:02	@zocky	and that's the only way for eurozone countries to obtain money now
2013-05-10 20:18:13	@zocky	because ECB can't lend directly to governments
2013-05-10 20:18:34	@spectie	isn't that good ?
2013-05-10 20:18:40	@spectie	otherwise it would just go mad
2013-05-10 20:18:51	@iLogical	i dont know the difference
2013-05-10 20:18:59	@spectie	like lending to people who couldn't pay back
2013-05-10 20:19:08	@spectie	like interest-only mortgages
2013-05-10 20:19:10	@iLogical	what's the difference spectie ?
2013-05-10 20:19:24	@iLogical	between borrowing and lending?
2013-05-10 20:19:25	@spectie	lend / borrow = prestar
2013-05-10 20:19:33	@spectie	I borrow from you, you lend to me
2013-05-10 20:20:06	@iLogical	that's confusing
2013-05-10 20:20:08	@iLogical	in portuguese
2013-05-10 20:20:10	@zocky	ECB prints 100€. Gives it to the bank and expects 100.5€ back. The bank gives 100€ to the speculator and expects 102€ back. The speculator gives it to a government and expects 105€ back.
2013-05-10 20:20:13	@zocky	See the problem?
2013-05-10 20:20:23	@iLogical	we can say Eu empresto de você, você empresta para mim
2013-05-10 20:20:29	@iLogical	same damn word
2013-05-10 20:20:30	@spectie	iLogical, yeah
2013-05-10 20:20:35	@spectie	it's semantic roles
2013-05-10 20:20:50	@zocky	iLogical, it's like that in many languages
2013-05-10 20:21:06	@bogdan	zocky, the banks get guaranteed money by getting it from ECB and giving it to national governments.
2013-05-10 20:21:17	@bogdan	zocky, they get free money without doing anything.
2013-05-10 20:21:21	@bogdan	err. spectie:
2013-05-10 20:21:31	@zocky	bogdan, and the speculators
2013-05-10 20:21:40	@spectie	zocky, i don't like speculators
2013-05-10 20:21:48	@zocky	and over time, that money becomes an ever larger share of the total amount of money
2013-05-10 20:22:08	@zocky	and the amount of money required each year to pay the loan back becomes an ever larger share of the GDP
2013-05-10 20:22:38	@bogdan	spectie, since the ECB printed just 100€ in that example, there's no way that the "real economy" can pay back those 105€.
2013-05-10 20:22:46	@bogdan	spectie, so they need to borrow 105€ to pay those 100€
2013-05-10 20:22:49	@bogdan	ercx
2013-05-10 20:22:51	@bogdan	etc
2013-05-10 20:23:19	@bogdan	spectie, this is the way the system was thought. the banks will win more and more as percentage of the economy.
2013-05-10 20:23:27	@Clint	it's easy if you counterfeit 5€
2013-05-10 20:23:37	@zocky	well, it can, if it increases by 5% each year AND the ECB decides to print enough money AND a magic unicorn shuffles numbers around just right
2013-05-10 20:23:51	@bogdan	spectie, in the US, *HALF* of all profits of the economy are made by the financial industry, and half by the real industry.
2013-05-10 20:24:03	@bogdan	spectie, basically, the banks/speculators get half of all the profits.
2013-05-10 20:24:21	@spectie	:(
2013-05-10 20:24:43	@zocky	but in the US, it'll just cause a revolution

2013-05-10 20:24:57	@zocky	in europe, we're talking about countries getting screwed by other countries
2013-05-10 20:24:59	@zocky	that can cause war
2013-05-10 20:25:03	@qfr	From: http://www.amazon.com/Sams-Teach-Yourself-Hours-5th/dp/0672333317 http://www.newthinktank.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/gwwii038.jpg
2013-05-10 20:25:33	@spectie	haha qfr
2013-05-10 20:25:36	@zocky	(and it's not really other countries that are screwing them, but it's close enough for nationalistic purposes)
2013-05-10 20:25:39	@qfr	;D
2013-05-10 20:26:04	@iLogical	qfr, explain
2013-05-10 20:26:22	@qfr	iLogical, the greater initial theme was "bizarre/disconnected book covers"
2013-05-10 20:26:23	@zocky	qfr, not good, too obvious
2013-05-10 20:26:35	@zocky	qfr, loose the helmet, and replace the bomb with a wrench
2013-05-10 20:26:52	@zocky	maybe use a worker's helmet
2013-05-10 20:26:52	@qfr	iLogical, zocky posted this one http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/5/10/1368196303389/af317512-a1b7-45ce-9e6d-d0a9b477c4b6-bestSizeAvailable.jpeg
2013-05-10 20:27:03	@qfr	So I made this one http://siyobik.info.gf/misc/black-white-red/nietzsche.jpg
2013-05-10 20:27:09	@bogdan	zocky, I read an article in the Norwegian press about how Germany's success is built on poorly-paid workers.
2013-05-10 20:27:20	@qfr	And then I decided I'd start drawings with bizarre covers for fictional programming books
2013-05-10 20:27:33	@spectie	bogdan, i read that in the french press here
2013-05-10 20:27:36	@zocky	bogdan, that's partially true, but mostly true but irrelevant
2013-05-10 20:27:36	@bogdan	zocky, and how there's not much prosperity among the German working classes, despite "Germany's success"
2013-05-10 20:27:39	@qfr	iLogical, on top of that all the "teach yourself <really complex subject> in n days/hours" books are ridiculous
2013-05-10 20:27:48	@spectie	bogdan, they want an end to 3.5euro/hour jobs
2013-05-10 20:27:49	@qfr	Learning C++ takes 5-10 years
2013-05-10 20:27:51	@qfr	Realistically
2013-05-10 20:27:56	@spectie	bollocks qfr
2013-05-10 20:28:01	@zocky	the partially true bit is that they now have a new underclass of unprotected workers
2013-05-10 20:28:08	@zocky	who are getting badly screwed
2013-05-10 20:28:10	@spectie	5-10 years if you start out with having no knowledge of computers
2013-05-10 20:28:16	@qfr	Even those who use C++ on a daily basis hardly know it
2013-05-10 20:28:18	@zocky	but most germans still have regular jobs so they don't care
2013-05-10 20:28:22	@qfr	spectie, it's an immensely complex language
2013-05-10 20:28:30	@qfr	Not even the people on the standard committee fully know it
2013-05-10 20:28:34	@spectie	depends how you define "know c++"
2013-05-10 20:28:41	@spectie	i write c++
2013-05-10 20:28:50	@spectie	thus i know c++
2013-05-10 20:28:53	@qfr	Lawl
2013-05-10 20:28:55	@spectie	but i don't pretend to be good at it
2013-05-10 20:28:57	@iLogical	stop creating a cult around a shitty skill which is that of programming a specific language
2013-05-10 20:28:58	@zocky	the true but irrelevant bit is that germans don't own a lot of stuff, and spend more of their money on hoarding it
2013-05-10 20:29:03	@spectie	iLogical, +1
2013-05-10 20:29:12	@qfr	This wasn't even the theme of the drawing
2013-05-10 20:29:16	@zocky	iLogical, especially c++
2013-05-10 20:29:20	@bogdan	I know C++ and I'm pretty good at it, but I never used it for real programming.
2013-05-10 20:29:25	@iLogical	the thing is
2013-05-10 20:29:30	@spectie	bogdan only programs in delphi
2013-05-10 20:29:39	@qfr	And I'm not saying C++ is great, in fact I avoid it whenever possible because it's very low level/unsafe
2013-05-10 20:29:48	@iLogical	the language doesn't even matter so much as the programming logic does
2013-05-10 20:29:50	@bogdan	spectie, nowadays, delphi, python, C#, javascript and occasionally, ruby.
2013-05-10 20:29:59	@zocky	spectie, he has an office in greece? :O

2013-05-10 20:30:41	@qfr	Definitely not MONO
2013-05-10 20:30:46	@Parsi	why you don't use Java or Python?
2013-05-10 20:30:51	@zocky	C# is indeed better than c++, but haha, he's as aspie in it as in c++
2013-05-10 20:30:56	@spectie	i'm going to finland tomorrow
2013-05-10 20:30:57	@qfr	C# is like what Java should have been
2013-05-10 20:31:03	@qfr	And Python is typed dynamically

2013-05-10 20:32:02	@qfr	Parsi, I don't write software that depends on number crunching
2013-05-10 20:32:07	@qfr	Well, sometimes I do, but it's database stuff then
2013-05-10 20:32:16	@spectie	i nevre use databases
2013-05-10 20:32:17	@spectie	ever
2013-05-10 20:32:17	@qfr	So that's about writing good PostgreSQL queries and such

2013-05-10 20:32:36	@Parsi	spectie: wtf! how it's possible?
2013-05-10 20:32:48	@bogdan	spectie, not even those fancy NoSQL fads? :P

2013-05-10 20:32:53	@spectie	no bogdan
2013-05-10 20:32:54	@zocky	spectie, start it with "Shut up, you Finn! You Finns, you always talk and talk, and say things like 'Finnish has 57 cases' or 'Swedes are gay'."
2013-05-10 20:32:59	@Parsi	it's easy
2013-05-10 20:32:59	@spectie	haha zocky
2013-05-10 20:33:00	@qfr	So the primary bottleneck for the services I write for low end Linux servers is... memory usage

2013-05-10 20:38:05	@zocky	nah, that just defines what kind of chip they get implanted in their brains and THAT defines the type of school they're going to
2013-05-10 20:38:08	@qfr	In some states it's 10
2013-05-10 20:38:24	@qfr	Since the type of school you attend heavily limits what you can do later
2013-05-10 20:38:30	@zocky	that's quite early
2013-05-10 20:38:34	@qfr	Out of the three types only the top one enables you to go to university
2013-05-10 20:38:44	@qfr	The political left in Germany wants to abolish this system
2013-05-10 20:38:49	@zocky	it was done at 15 here when I was a kid
2013-05-10 20:38:50	@qfr	To replace it with a unified school system

2013-05-10 20:48:27	@zocky	I wish we still had the education system we had when I was a kid. it was dismantled for purely political reasons, though it actually educated people very well, and didn't have closed loops like that
2013-05-10 20:49:23	@zocky	university required (depending on the faculty) a certain number of secondary-school hours for particular subjects
2013-05-10 20:49:49	@zocky	so if you went to a specialized secondary school that didn't have e.g. enough mathematics, you had to pass an additional exam
2013-05-10 20:50:13	@zocky	but that was it, and then you could apply for entrance exams like everybody else

2013-05-10 20:57:04	@iLogical	There are numerous ways to achieve admission to German colleges and universities.[27] The most traditional route has always been graduation from a Gymnasium with the Abitur; however this has become less common over time. As of 2008, less than half of university freshmen in some German states had graduated from a Gymnasium.

2013-05-10 21:15:37	@zocky	the reason those people should've been shot for treason is that they assumed that "large losses" matter

2013-05-10 22:19:18	@zocky	iLogical, the claim is that the bread and wine changes into guts and liver and other parts of the body of christ, but in a way which is not detectable in any way
2013-05-10 22:19:27	Gennadius	for example, a human being outside may have all the accidents of a cat, it would still be a human being, but it would appear to us a cat

2013-05-10 22:20:08	@Cassowaries	dna is one of the accidents

2013-05-10 22:21:26	@Cassowaries	or, alternatively, any attempt to observe the quantum eucharistic host collapses its waveform into bread and wine
2013-05-10 22:21:28	@B-rat	zocky, bronies

2013-05-10 22:21:44	@B-rat	haha Cassowaries
2013-05-10 22:21:49	@B-rat	that makes more sense
2013-05-10 22:22:07	@B-rat	but also basically means they are admitting that it is bread and wine
2013-05-10 22:22:10	@zocky	a basket is a hat, if you wear it on your head
2013-05-10 22:22:19	@zocky	a cat is still a cat, even if you wear it on your head
2013-05-10 22:22:27	@Cassowaries	B-rat, that isn't denied, as such - it still has the attributes of bread and wine
2013-05-10 22:22:35	@Cassowaries	but it is not 'merely' bread and wine
2013-05-10 22:22:37	Gennadius	the thing itself is insensible, it is the accidents that are sensible
2013-05-10 22:22:38	@zocky	but the claim here is that the basket becomes a cat just because
2013-05-10 22:22:47	Gennadius	it is not bread and wine at all
2013-05-10 22:23:01	@zocky	it's very newagy
2013-05-10 22:23:01	@B-rat	if it walks like a duck

2013-05-10 22:25:15	@B-rat	i like how you can just throw away observable reality like that, Gennadius
2013-05-10 22:25:22	@B-rat	it takes real commitment to be certifiably insane
2013-05-10 22:25:24	@B-rat	on purpose
2013-05-10 22:25:27	@B-rat	you should become the joker
2013-05-10 22:25:30	@Cassowaries	Gennadius, the gulf here is with a materialistic worldview, so the definition of what "it is" means is different, therefore the observed thing _is_ the thing
2013-05-10 22:25:53	@Cassowaries	that's the problem with just stating "it is not bread and wine at all"
2013-05-10 22:25:58	 *	SkEmO turns B-rat  into B-cat 
2013-05-10 22:26:03	Gennadius	yes, that is precisely the case, Cassowaries
2013-05-10 22:26:29	@zocky	Cassowaries, it's not THAT exactly. it's more that if there's no way to tell what it is, it could be anything, and in that case discussing it is meaningless
2013-05-10 22:26:57	@Cassowaries	zocky, I completely agree
2013-05-10 22:27:08	@zocky	the idea that things aren't necessarily what they seem doesn't directly contradict any logic
2013-05-10 22:27:27	@zocky	but if there's no way to find out what it really is, it's not interesting
2013-05-10 22:28:04	@Cassowaries	aye
2013-05-10 22:28:11	@Cassowaries	my issue is really with the two sides trying to argue without recognising the problem of definition
2013-05-10 22:28:29	@qfr	Gennadius, you say there's a physical change but how can there be physical change without it being scientifically detectable
2013-05-10 22:28:37	@Cassowaries	see ^
2013-05-10 22:28:48	@qfr	Maybe we have different definitions of physical reality
2013-05-10 22:28:53	@qfr	T_T
2013-05-10 22:29:12	@qfr	I have been spoiled by years of scientific education
2013-05-10 22:29:25	@zocky	Cassowaries, my more general issue is that this has become a quasi-political issue, and people who perfectly agree on things like secularism and welfare state, accuse each other of being religious fanatics and uncaring child-murderers
2013-05-10 22:29:36	@zocky	instead of everybody joining to hang the toffs
2013-05-10 22:29:39	Gennadius	because, following aristotelean philosophy, substance is a distinct thing-in-itself, independent from properties of the substance
2013-05-10 22:29:40	@Cassowaries	haha
2013-05-10 22:29:55	@B-rat	but
2013-05-10 22:29:58	@B-rat	i am a child-murderer
2013-05-10 22:30:05	@B-rat	in that i murdered people when i was a child
2013-05-10 22:30:09	@Cassowaries	yeah, zocky, I basically reduce all of these sorts of thing as interesting things to read about

2013-05-10 22:31:39	Gennadius	for example, if i have a cat and paint it yellow, it is still the same cat. likewise, if i stretch the cat, or put it in a mold (cat bonsai) and give it plastic surgery to resemble a young mary kate toddler
2013-05-10 22:32:05	@B-rat	it sort of looks at modern western society from an anthropological point of view and determines that like past failed cultures it's going down the same route
2013-05-10 22:32:07	@Cassowaries	lol I remember bonsai kittens

2013-05-10 22:34:56	@zocky	yes, they should be banned everywhere
2013-05-10 22:35:02	@zocky	just to keep the nazis oppressed
2013-05-10 22:35:16	@zocky	one of the main requirements for a free society is oppression of nazis
2013-05-10 22:35:31	@Cassowaries	physical oppression is preferable
2013-05-10 22:35:38	@Cassowaries	but ideological is fine in a pinch

2013-05-11 03:30:16	@zocky	The anatomical peculiarity of the 'Punjabi Prawndick' is variously attributed to our Nordic-Iranian descent, our oversized obese bodies, or our love of alcohol. As a corollary, it is also generally believed that the wedge-like 'Punjabi Baby Carrot' is the root cause for the popularity of anal copulation or 'Punjabi Sex' across Pentapotamia. It is also universally held to be the primary reason our Punjabans prefer Afro-Dravidian & Negro-Caribbean men.

2013-05-11 04:05:12	Gennadius1	Data from a cross-cultural study of conversational behaviour were  compared with the phonological inventories of the languages being spoken. There was a highly significant  inverse relationship between the number of contrastive vowels and the  average volume of native speakers' voices. It seems that  different languages are not equally salient perceptually.

2013-05-11 06:33:31	Gennadius	weird
2013-05-11 06:33:41	Gennadius	in any case, i bet there is nice tile work inside!
2013-05-11 06:33:49	@zocky	nah, all gone long ago
2013-05-11 06:34:08	Gennadius	would the tiles have been sold?
2013-05-11 06:34:12	Gennadius	do they have resale value?
2013-05-11 06:34:14	@zocky	no idea
2013-05-11 06:34:21	Parsi	where are you from Gennadius?
2013-05-11 06:34:25	Gennadius	u.s.a.
2013-05-11 06:34:26	@zocky	i don't know what tiling they had
2013-05-11 06:34:37	@zocky	they were austrohungarian in origin, and closed down in socialism
2013-05-11 06:34:43	Parsi	you might-ed states
2013-05-11 06:34:59	@zocky	in the 1970s, i think, when even the last houses in the old city centers got regular plumbing
2013-05-11 06:35:21	Gennadius	apparently in china, communal bathing was common through the 80s
2013-05-11 06:35:31	Gennadius	i think it was mixed sex, too, but don't hold me to that
2013-05-11 06:36:53	@zocky	it wasn't mixed sex here, but not very segregated, AFAICR
2013-05-11 06:37:01	Gennadius	in the u.s. now, zocky, bath houses are an ethnic thing. jewish-americans have their mikvah/shvitz, russian-americans have their banya, gay-americans have their dens of perdition.
2013-05-11 06:37:19	@zocky	we don't have bath houses anymore, we have spas
2013-05-11 06:37:36	Parsi	can you tell us a quote right know Gennadius?
2013-05-11 06:37:36	@zocky	and those are almost always mixed sex
2013-05-11 06:37:44	Gennadius	which quote?
2013-05-11 06:37:50	Parsi	whatever
2013-05-11 06:38:00	@zocky	you can go to slovenian saunas and gape at naked chicks, if you're that desperate
2013-05-11 06:38:49	Gennadius	e preputio caseum. it's my personal motto
2013-05-11 06:38:52	Gennadius	out of foreskin, cheese
2013-05-11 06:39:10	@zocky	you still can't get your mind off that docking picture, eh?
2013-05-11 06:39:52	Gennadius	are slovenian women built sturdy?
2013-05-11 06:40:27	Gennadius	i read once that people from the dinaric alps are incredibly tall
2013-05-11 06:40:30	Gennadius	taller than the dutch
2013-05-11 06:40:54	Parsi	Gennadius: may I ask which state do you live in?
2013-05-11 06:41:02	Gennadius	illinois

2013-05-11 06:41:22	@chabibi	?
2013-05-11 06:41:58	@zocky	Gennadius, yes, people from the dinaric alps are incredibly tall, and slovenians are very tall too, though dinaric alps barely touch slovenia
2013-05-11 06:42:41	Gennadius	well, if the dinaric alps are incredibly tall, i would expect them to get gradually shorter as you radiate out
2013-05-11 06:42:48	Gennadius	people in the*
2013-05-11 06:42:54	@zocky	it's really herzegovinian and montenegrin highlands where EVERYBODY is freakishly tall
2013-05-11 06:43:12	@zocky	nah, lowlanders in those parts are rather short
2013-05-11 06:44:13	Gennadius	interesting. you spent a lot of time in the balkans?
2013-05-11 06:44:24	@zocky	Gennadius, the last 40 years
2013-05-11 06:44:31	Gennadius	who makes the best burek?
2013-05-11 06:44:52	@zocky	bosnia > macedonia > serbia > croatia >> slovenia
2013-05-11 06:45:01	Gennadius	no albania, i notice
2013-05-11 06:45:17	@zocky	albania is behind the iron curtain
2013-05-11 06:45:28	@zocky	and kosovo albanians make burek all over the place
2013-05-11 06:45:46	Gennadius	is criminality really that widely tolerated among albanians?
2013-05-11 06:45:50	Gennadius	compared with others
2013-05-11 06:46:03	@zocky	yes and no
2013-05-11 06:46:16	@zocky	albania is a lawless country, and so is kosovo
2013-05-11 06:46:36	@zocky	so a lot of people from there are involved in various criminal activities
2013-05-11 06:46:46	@zocky	but regular people are the same as everywhere else
2013-05-11 06:47:20	Gennadius	that makes sense, but there are different cultural responses to criminality. i wasn't sure where albanians fell.
2013-05-11 06:47:38	Gennadius	for example, in parts of the southern u.s., the moonshiner is still something of a cultural icon and hero
2013-05-11 06:48:04	Gennadius	as were the clever smugglers in england in early modern times
2013-05-11 06:48:26	Gennadius	and there were many songs glamorizing the exploits of bandits at one time, too

2013-05-11 07:00:03	Gennadius	the little boy ends up becoming a famous saint revered throughout england, and the object of veneration and pilgrimage

2013-05-11 08:46:02	qfr	:D
2013-05-11 08:46:06	@Spaceghost	Drugs.
2013-05-11 08:46:10	qfr	saimazoon, today I kinda finished the code for my thesis though
2013-05-11 08:46:20	qfr	And I have close to 3 weeks left until the final deadline
2013-05-11 08:46:29	qfr	So I'm confident
2013-05-11 08:47:15	@saimazoon	qfr: did you think about perhaps enrolling in an graduate programme
2013-05-11 08:47:57	qfr	saimazoon, nope
2013-05-11 08:48:04	qfr	Never occurred to me
2013-05-11 08:48:23	@saimazoon	or would you rather start living off your financial property full time
2013-05-11 08:48:36	@saimazoon	you said you had investments in the stock market
2013-05-11 08:48:38	qfr	I'd rather try out an office job
2013-05-11 08:48:41	qfr	Not anymore
2013-05-11 08:48:47	qfr	I got rid of that stuff a long time ago
2013-05-11 08:48:55	@saimazoon	an office job
2013-05-11 08:49:00	@saimazoon	where, in karlsruhe?
2013-05-11 08:49:04	qfr	Yes
2013-05-11 08:49:40	@saimazoon	aren't you interested in research
2013-05-11 08:49:44	@saimazoon	pursuing a career in academia
2013-05-11 08:49:46	qfr	No
2013-05-11 08:49:51	@saimazoon	why not
2013-05-11 08:49:59	qfr	That's really hard work and badly paid
2013-05-11 08:50:17	@saimazoon	even in germany?
2013-05-11 08:50:18	@saimazoon	no shit
2013-05-11 08:50:32	@saimazoon	researchers make less than gypsies sweeping the streets in madrid
2013-05-11 08:50:33	qfr	Nobody does it for the money
2013-05-11 08:50:43	qfr	And I mostly despise the field
2013-05-11 08:50:51	@saimazoon	but i wouldn't think germany is pretty much the same
2013-05-11 08:50:51	@Parsi	saimazoon: it's same here
2013-05-11 08:51:03	qfr	Most of it is so disconnected from the things I care about
2013-05-11 08:51:09	qfr	And you can't really do the research you want
2013-05-11 08:51:17	qfr	It's dictated mostly
2013-05-11 08:51:22	qfr	By the faculty you work for
2013-05-11 08:51:39	@saimazoon	you can go do research in a faculty working in the field that interests you
2013-05-11 08:51:46	qfr	And you are constantly pressured to release more shitty papers
2013-05-11 08:51:51	qfr	To meet stupid quotas
2013-05-11 08:52:01	qfr	Even if you have no results yet
2013-05-11 08:52:05	@saimazoon	because the quality and amount of your work in academia is measured in terms of your paper output
2013-05-11 08:52:20	@saimazoon	so as to make it easier for your department boss to get more state funds
2013-05-11 08:52:28	qfr	Well, it's measured in citations usually
2013-05-11 08:52:44	qfr	If you can get like 50 citations a year you're doing pretty well in your field
2013-05-11 08:52:50	@saimazoon	i can imagine citation counting applications available for download
2013-05-11 08:53:02	@saimazoon	qfr: sounds a bit like attention whoring
2013-05-11 08:53:06	@saimazoon	if you can get everyone to look at you
2013-05-11 08:53:08	qfr	saimazoon, they are part of every online outlet
2013-05-11 08:53:12	qfr	Like IEEE, ACM et
2013-05-11 08:53:12	qfr	c
2013-05-11 08:53:23	@saimazoon	seems like it's just another game
2013-05-11 08:53:24	qfr	Don't even need homebrew solutions
2013-05-11 08:53:26	@saimazoon	and you don't like its rules
2013-05-11 08:53:28	qfr	It is somewhat
2013-05-11 08:54:14	@saimazoon	i can imagine many depressed people working in research
2013-05-11 08:54:19	@saimazoon	in stuff that doesn't interest them
2013-05-11 08:54:21	@saimazoon	with shitty pays
2013-05-11 08:54:22	qfr	Yes...
2013-05-11 08:54:49	qfr	All the ones I talked to were constantly under pressure and seemed stressed out about something
2013-05-11 08:54:58	qfr	Except for one or two
2013-05-11 08:55:06	@saimazoon	i've already put up with enough stress as an undergraduate student
2013-05-11 08:55:09	@saimazoon	with deadlines and exam dates
2013-05-11 08:55:13	@saimazoon	being all crammed into the same week
2013-05-11 08:55:24	@saimazoon	after i graduate myself
2013-05-11 08:55:30	@saimazoon	i don't want responsibilities of any kind
2013-05-11 08:55:40	the9th	responsibilities suck
2013-05-11 08:55:59	qfr	They were always moaning about deadlines
2013-05-11 08:56:13	qfr	Or being forced to work on shit they don't care about
2013-05-11 08:56:14	@saimazoon	doesn't sound much different than people working in company projects
2013-05-11 08:56:22	qfr	True
2013-05-11 08:56:25	qfr	Except the pay is shit
2013-05-11 08:57:34	@saimazoon	i'll be applying for DAAD's grant next year
2013-05-11 08:57:35	qfr	Actually it's this one faculty that was particularly bad about this I think
2013-05-11 08:57:38	qfr	The other ones were more relaxed
2013-05-11 08:57:38	@saimazoon	i need to take a german profficiency test
2013-05-11 08:57:41	@saimazoon	but it's just a B1 level
2013-05-11 08:58:06	@saimazoon	qfr: but yours is the most prestigious one in germany
2013-05-11 08:58:08	@saimazoon	or so i've read
2013-05-11 08:58:17	@saimazoon	best computer science school in germany
2013-05-11 08:58:33	qfr	Is it still?
2013-05-11 08:58:36	qfr	I thought it dropped
2013-05-11 08:58:39	qfr	To like rank 5-10
2013-05-11 08:58:42	qfr	But I could be wrong
2013-05-11 08:58:53	@saimazoon	last time i looked it up, i think it was still at the top
2013-05-11 08:58:57	@saimazoon	but i don't remember how long ago  this was
2013-05-11 08:59:08	@saimazoon	anyway, qfr
2013-05-11 08:59:15	@saimazoon	i'll be doing a master's degree only if i get paid for it
2013-05-11 08:59:17	@saimazoon	with a grant
2013-05-11 08:59:25	@saimazoon	otherwise, i'll kill myself
2013-05-11 08:59:27	neuro_sys	will you immediately apply for a job after you're done with your university stuff?
2013-05-11 08:59:35	@saimazoon	i will
2013-05-11 08:59:56	qfr	neuro_sys, no, I need to wait for my university to process my degree etc first
2013-05-11 09:00:01	qfr	Sometimes that shit takes like 3 months
2013-05-11 09:00:05	qfr	Until I get my diploma
2013-05-11 09:00:08	neuro_sys	I'm curious with what sorts of job you'll apply for
2013-05-11 09:00:13	qfr	Development

2013-05-11 15:15:15	@saimazoon	qfr: do you understand the wording of the poncaire conjectre
2013-05-11 15:15:27	@qfr	No
2013-05-11 15:15:29	@B-rat	what's not to understand
2013-05-11 15:15:31	@B-rat	it's barely 34 pages
2013-05-11 15:15:34	@qfr	I have no knowledge of topology
2013-05-11 15:16:37	@qfr	B-rat, uh, I don't think you're referring to the conjecture now
2013-05-11 15:16:44	@qfr	You're referring to Perelman's proof
2013-05-11 15:17:27	@B-rat	oh ,yeah
2013-05-11 15:17:42	@B-rat	i'm not really paying that much attention
2013-05-11 15:18:54	@saimazoon	topology seems to be that field of mathematics that almost every mathematician likes working in
2013-05-11 15:19:02	@saimazoon	but that remains virtually untaught in engineering disciplines
2013-05-11 15:19:07	@B-rat	is there a difference between a sample average and an estimator for the population average
2013-05-11 15:19:08	@B-rat	because
2013-05-11 15:19:15	@B-rat	these statistics textbooks are like arcane tombs
2013-05-11 15:19:34	@B-rat	saimazoon, not a whole lot of it can be applied
2013-05-11 15:19:44	@saimazoon	a sample average is one example of estimator function, B-rat
2013-05-11 15:19:47	@saimazoon	but you could think of others
2013-05-11 15:19:55	@saimazoon	and anyway that only works for point estimation
2013-05-11 15:19:56	@B-rat	sure
2013-05-11 15:19:57	@B-rat	but
2013-05-11 15:20:01	@B-rat	why even have a name for them
2013-05-11 15:20:09	@B-rat	it's just sample foobar instead of population foobar
2013-05-11 15:20:16	@B-rat	for the most part
2013-05-11 15:20:22	@saimazoon	naming conventions in statistics are bullshit
2013-05-11 15:20:24	@B-rat	i really despise their terminology
2013-05-11 15:20:25	@B-rat	yeah
2013-05-11 15:20:25	@saimazoon	names like "random variable"
2013-05-11 15:20:31	@saimazoon	i feel like shitting on them
2013-05-11 15:20:34	@B-rat	same
2013-05-11 15:20:45	@B-rat	it's even worse when translated into slovene
2013-05-11 15:21:05	@saimazoon	it's even worse when translated into spanish
2013-05-11 15:21:11	@B-rat	:>
2013-05-11 15:21:14	@saimazoon	because they translate "mathematical expectation" as "esperanza matematica"
2013-05-11 15:21:27	@saimazoon	which to the untrained ear sounds like "mathematical hope"
2013-05-11 15:21:28	@B-rat	haha
2013-05-11 15:21:30	@B-rat	yeah
2013-05-11 15:21:42	@B-rat	statistical bias in slovene sounds like statistical favoritism
2013-05-11 15:21:45	@saimazoon	which on a first reader leaves the student completely hopeless
2013-05-11 15:21:48	@B-rat	to me at least
2013-05-11 15:21:58	@saimazoon	ah, not in spanish
2013-05-11 15:21:59	@B-rat	which you know, makes sense in a way
2013-05-11 15:22:00	@saimazoon	sesgo estadistico
2013-05-11 15:22:01	@B-rat	but really
2013-05-11 15:22:05	@B-rat	that is a terrible term for it
2013-05-11 15:22:19	@B-rat	why even have that term when error works fine
2013-05-11 15:22:44	@saimazoon	seriously the worst name in discrete probably was random variable
2013-05-11 15:22:47	@saimazoon	which is not a variable
2013-05-11 15:22:48	@saimazoon	but a function
2013-05-11 15:22:54	@saimazoon	that's pretty much like calling a penis a vagina
2013-05-11 15:23:04	@B-rat	also the symbols they use seem more or less completely random
2013-05-11 15:23:27	@saimazoon	statissticss makes a lot more sense if you approach it formally, B-rat
2013-05-11 15:23:32	@saimazoon	namely, first taking a course in measure theory
2013-05-11 15:23:37	@B-rat	sure
2013-05-11 15:23:46	@saimazoon	but that's painful ass torture
2013-05-11 15:23:47	@B-rat	but i'm doing someone else's statistics report
2013-05-11 15:23:49	@saimazoon	and boring to no end
2013-05-11 15:23:56	@B-rat	i dont really care about statistics
2013-05-11 15:24:01	@B-rat	except maybe probabilistic game theory
2013-05-11 15:24:05	@B-rat	but that's much cleaner
2013-05-11 15:24:15	@saimazoon	math methods in AI are statistical for the most part
2013-05-11 15:24:22	@B-rat	sure
2013-05-11 15:24:30	@B-rat	it's mostly regression
2013-05-11 15:24:41	@saimazoon	i had a course in markov chains and queue theory
2013-05-11 15:24:45	@saimazoon	stochastic processes
2013-05-11 15:24:52	@B-rat	i dont get why anyone's still doing research in Marginally Better Regression For These Particular Problems
2013-05-11 15:24:58	@saimazoon	the introductory chapter began with borel sets and abstract algebra shit
2013-05-11 15:25:05	@saimazoon	which of course none of the students at the course knew anything about

It spread from china and Mongolia and it was then turned into a sport with a goat in Afghanistan, and in Persia they had a similar form of the game with something similar to a puck instead of a

2013-05-11 19:17:34	@neuro_sys	teh_almarar: I don't think so.
2013-05-11 19:17:54	@neuro_sys	I don't know any mutually intelligible languages with Turkish except some asian Turkic languages.
2013-05-11 19:18:21	@neuro_sys	Even they're removed far from the one we speak here, mixed with farsi and arabic words.

2013-05-12 06:05:13	@saimazoon	you said you've never had sex, i assume that that means you've never been into a romantic relationship with a woman

2013-05-12 06:05:34	@saimazoon	one thing doesn't preclude the otheer, because they pertain to different life domains of physical enjoyment

2013-05-12 06:09:31	Gennadius	yeah, when i don't remember, it's usually because i deemed their answers uninteresting
2013-05-12 06:09:32	@saimazoon	if i throw qfr a few question over his sex life, it's very unlikely i'll bother trying to remember them in the long run

2013-05-12 07:28:00	@Bucketphase	with 50 camels i'm sure one of those would be equally ravishing

2013-05-12 07:28:06	qfr	So far he has claimed to be from at least 4-6 countries in my presence

2013-05-12 07:29:19	@almar	this is not pleasant for me, but if you want me daughter the Superangebot stands
2013-05-12 07:29:44	@the9th	perhaps we can agree on 20 camels?

2013-05-12 07:45:13	@almar	lol Eldgamla Ísafold is a highly romantic nationalistic poem
2013-05-12 07:45:20	@the9th	Do you like Cubase? Or you just plan to stick with it?
2013-05-12 07:45:24	@almar	there was a small scene of nazi punks in our small town
2013-05-12 07:45:27	@the9th	Thoughts on Pro Tools or Reaper?
2013-05-12 07:45:27	qfr	Cubase is good
2013-05-12 07:45:32	qfr	I mean it's pretty much the industrial standard
2013-05-12 07:45:34	@almar	so we decided to mock them with romantic poetry.
2013-05-12 07:45:38	@almar	it worked wonders. the nazi scene died
2013-05-12 07:45:39	@almar	and yes
2013-05-12 07:45:41	qfr	Never used Pro Tools
2013-05-12 07:45:41	@the9th	Cubase isn't the industry standard
2013-05-12 07:45:43	qfr	Not familiar with Reaper
2013-05-12 07:45:44	@almar	this is all recorded on Cubase

2013-05-12 07:47:04	@almar	I must get them in order
2013-05-12 07:47:06	@the9th	So, you disbanded? Or did the other two move with you -- and the band is in tact?
2013-05-12 07:47:11	@almar	no well
2013-05-12 07:47:13	@almar	that's the stupid part.
2013-05-12 07:47:18	@almar	we never really befriended the drummer
2013-05-12 07:47:19	qfr	I recorded some new guitar tracks recently but I'm not sure if I'm going to continue working on them
2013-05-12 07:47:20	 *	the9th braces for the stpuid
2013-05-12 07:47:25	@almar	the guitarist and I are childhood friends
2013-05-12 07:47:31	@the9th	qfr: You should continue working on them.
2013-05-12 07:47:31	@almar	and we met in a small country school
2013-05-12 07:47:38	@the9th	almar: That's cute.
2013-05-12 07:47:40	@almar	the drummer was one year younger and we just got him to play
2013-05-12 07:47:47	@almar	because he played drums, and we were few
2013-05-12 07:47:49	qfr	the9th, they are different genres though
2013-05-12 07:47:51	@almar	but he never became our friend
2013-05-12 07:47:54	qfr	I was evaluating different styles
2013-05-12 07:48:02	@almar	we were really active
2013-05-12 07:48:06	@almar	in may 2009 we played 17 gigs
2013-05-12 07:48:06	qfr	One is more black metal, the other one is more death metal
2013-05-12 07:48:13	@almar	it was ridiculous fun, and we were like 16 at the time ð
2013-05-12 07:48:22	qfr	developing them both into one release would be... inconsistent
2013-05-12 07:48:25	@the9th	qfr: You should venture out to some other genres besides these two
2013-05-12 07:48:31	qfr	No, definitely not
2013-05-12 07:48:33	@almar	but shortly after that, the drummer stopped answering our phone calls very often
2013-05-12 07:48:34	qfr	I've done that in the past
2013-05-12 07:48:35	@the9th	Then you're a fool
2013-05-12 07:48:37	qfr	Not interested
2013-05-12 07:48:39	qfr	No
2013-05-12 07:48:42	qfr	This is good
2013-05-12 07:48:43	@almar	and somehow he stopped interacting with us
2013-05-12 07:48:44	@the9th	Close-minded
2013-05-12 07:48:56	@almar	the process of recording the third album took a year or so
2013-05-12 07:49:03	@almar	during which we played only 3 shows
2013-05-12 07:49:11	@almar	but in 2009 we played like 60
2013-05-12 07:49:15	@almar	crazy year.
2013-05-12 07:49:21	@almar	same year i started doing drugs.
2013-05-12 07:49:22	@the9th	almar: You know why he left?
2013-05-12 07:49:23	@almar	lol
2013-05-12 07:49:26	@almar	he's a dick
2013-05-12 07:49:28	qfr	the9th, you make it sound as if I had control over what I like
2013-05-12 07:49:29	@the9th	He probably joined some other band
2013-05-12 07:49:30	qfr	But I don't
2013-05-12 07:49:37	@the9th	Drummers are a dime a dozen, drummers are hard to find
2013-05-12 07:49:38	@almar	the9th: he started making youtube videos
2013-05-12 07:49:43	@almar	and we weren't making any money
2013-05-12 07:49:45	qfr	It's just... innate
2013-05-12 07:49:47	@the9th	Oops,
2013-05-12 07:49:51	@almar	he thought he could make money by making videos on youtube
2013-05-12 07:49:57	@the9th	Guitarists/bassists* are a dime a dozen, drummers are hard to find
2013-05-12 07:50:01	@almar	he made some drum covers of songs and got good view counts
2013-05-12 07:50:05	qfr	Yeah drummers are the rarest
2013-05-12 07:50:11	@the9th	almar: How many views?
2013-05-12 07:50:11	@almar	yup.
2013-05-12 07:50:15	@almar	well
2013-05-12 07:50:21	@almar	the first video got like 30,000
2013-05-12 07:50:21	@the9th	It's like... 100,000 views = 100 dollars
2013-05-12 07:50:25	@almar	so he became super motivated
2013-05-12 07:50:30	@the9th	So, all-in-all, that strategy is not a good one
2013-05-12 07:50:31	@almar	so he made more drum covers
2013-05-12 07:50:41	@almar	made one of a justin bieber cover...
2013-05-12 07:50:46	@almar	and got like 600,000 views
2013-05-12 07:50:51	@almar	so
2013-05-12 07:50:51	@almar	well
2013-05-12 07:50:52	@the9th	Wow, he became a prostitute
2013-05-12 07:50:53	@almar	nothing really
2013-05-12 07:50:55	@almar	yes.
2013-05-12 07:50:57	@almar	so
2013-05-12 07:50:58	@almar	uhh
2013-05-12 07:51:04	@almar	the moral... and everything... was just weird
2013-05-12 07:51:13	@almar	so i left that town and became a rootless cosmopolitan
2013-05-12 07:51:19	@almar	much like my good friend qfr
2013-05-12 07:51:22	@the9th	Did you have fun though?
2013-05-12 07:51:28	@almar	so much fun
2013-05-12 07:51:38	@almar	i feel like a burnt-out rockstar now
2013-05-12 07:51:39	@the9th	Well, you and qfr should get together and have fun together. You know what I mean?
2013-05-12 07:51:41	@almar	ready to do other stuff
2013-05-12 07:51:55	@almar	yeah, we could smoke some DMT together
2013-05-12 07:51:56	qfr	the9th, you mean artistically? That won't work
2013-05-12 07:52:05	qfr	We don't operate in the same genres at all
2013-05-12 07:52:23	@the9th	qfr: As buddies as well. Viability of artistic collaboration can be determined later.
2013-05-12 07:53:09	@the9th	almar: Did you play in bars? Where were the gigs you got?
2013-05-12 07:53:20	qfr	Plus I don't like live music
2013-05-12 07:53:21	@almar	we were not old enough
2013-05-12 07:53:27	@saimazoon	sex
2013-05-12 07:53:29	@almar	but later we played in some bars
2013-05-12 07:53:31	@almar	and got drinks
2013-05-12 07:53:33	qfr	I was invited to play at some event in Poland once
2013-05-12 07:53:37	@almar	lol, we were too socially awkward to get much sex
2013-05-12 07:53:41	qfr	They didn't know that I'm "studio only"
2013-05-12 07:53:49	@the9th	almar: Are you still awkward?
2013-05-12 07:54:08	@almar	nah
2013-05-12 07:54:17	@almar	all that rock and roll changed it
2013-05-12 07:54:22	@almar	lots of friends and booze and stuff

2013-05-12 07:58:47	@almar	the9th: it was more of a childhood isolation thing...
2013-05-12 07:58:54	@almar	the fact i spent more time here in #linguistics than among people
2013-05-12 07:59:01	@almar	then that happened again when i became an immigrant
2013-05-12 08:00:17	@saimazoon	a filthy immigrant mooching off the german welfare state

2013-05-12 08:00:33	@the9th	almar: That's no good. One should definitely not spend a lot of time in #linguistics than among people.
2013-05-12 08:00:49	@almar	do you like people?
2013-05-12 08:00:54	@almar	how's your business going?
2013-05-12 08:01:12	@the9th	I love people. Basically, I'm a people person. My business is excellent, my profit margins are better than they've ever been.
2013-05-12 08:01:21	@the9th	almar: How's the job situation for the youth in Iceland?
2013-05-12 08:01:23	@almar	and you work from home?
2013-05-12 08:01:28	@almar	bad.
2013-05-12 08:01:31	@the9th	I work from home correct.
2013-05-12 08:01:36	@almar	i want to do that
2013-05-12 08:01:39	@the9th	Almar: Was that a reason to you leaving Iceland?
2013-05-12 08:01:41	@almar	very much
2013-05-12 08:01:46	@almar	nah i had a job
2013-05-12 08:01:46	@the9th	almar: Then do that.
2013-05-12 08:01:46	@almar	lol
2013-05-12 08:01:49	@almar	i hated it
2013-05-12 08:01:50	@almar	very much
2013-05-12 08:02:06	@almar	well, i spent like 7 hours on reddit and facebook while getting paid
2013-05-12 08:02:11	@almar	but i hated that
2013-05-12 08:02:17	@the9th	What was the job?
2013-05-12 08:02:21	qfr	Sounds great
2013-05-12 08:02:28	qfr	Although I have no idea why you would use facebook
2013-05-12 08:02:30	@almar	my shifts were 12 hours though, from 7:30-19:30, and very frustrating at times
2013-05-12 08:02:33	@almar	i was a hotel receptionist
2013-05-12 08:02:40	@the9th	You should learn RoR or something, and do freelance webdev. Good money, work from home, and so on.
2013-05-12 08:02:40	@almar	and the hotel manager was extremely lazy
2013-05-12 08:02:48	@almar	so i was in care of bookings and stuff
2013-05-12 08:02:56	qfr	Ew RoR
2013-05-12 08:03:00	qfr	I do most of my webdev in C# nowadays
2013-05-12 08:03:06	@almar	hipster
2013-05-12 08:03:07	@the9th	qfr: Ew PHP, but if you want money you follow the tides.
2013-05-12 08:03:11	qfr	?
2013-05-12 08:03:14	qfr	PHP?
2013-05-12 08:03:18	@almar	the9th: that's exactly what i want
2013-05-12 08:03:19	qfr	I fucking hate PHP
2013-05-12 08:03:33	Parth	PHP FTW
2013-05-12 08:03:33	qfr	the9th, http://siyobik.info.gf/misc/black-white-red/php.jpg
2013-05-12 08:03:41	@the9th	Yeah, so do I, doesn't stop me from coding in PHP.
2013-05-12 08:03:41	qfr	I'm disgusted that you would suggest that I was promoting PHP over Ruby
2013-05-12 08:03:50	@the9th	If it gets me money, I do it.
2013-05-12 08:03:50	qfr	I've done a lot of web dev in Ruby although never with RoR
2013-05-12 08:04:00	qfr	I was using a custom framework running on top of Thin
2013-05-12 08:04:01	Parth	PHP+MySQL kills all.
2013-05-12 08:04:02	Parth	:)
2013-05-12 08:04:06	qfr	PHP is shit
2013-05-12 08:04:14	qfr	MySQL is... inferior to alternatives
2013-05-12 08:04:29	qfr	But it's not utterly terrible
2013-05-12 08:04:34	@the9th	Is Facebook a technically shitty application, in your eyes, as it's been coded in PHP?
2013-05-12 08:04:40	Parth	well it's the most supported so I unless I see Postgre or some other crap widely available I don't care :P
2013-05-12 08:05:00	qfr	the9th, it's written in a bad language then
2013-05-12 08:05:10	qfr	I mean you can still write decent code in a bad language
2013-05-12 08:05:20	qfr	But I've never seen their code so I can't tell you
2013-05-12 08:05:32	@the9th	qfr: Okay, so what matters is the results being delivered. We agree
2013-05-12 08:05:52	@the9th	Now, if there exist seasoned frameworks in PHP, that a noobie can take charge of and bake a nice webapp
2013-05-12 08:05:55	qfr	the9th, no, I don't agree
2013-05-12 08:05:56	@the9th	What's it to you? PHP is fine
2013-05-12 08:06:07	qfr	There is no excuse for using it in the first place
2013-05-12 08:06:23	@almar	lol.
2013-05-12 08:06:24	qfr	And it will always be unstable
2013-05-12 08:06:33	@the9th	I mean, I'm the first one to bitch about PHP, but the fact of the matter is it's a better decision for a lot of folks who're new to the game
2013-05-12 08:06:35	qfr	Parth, who gives a crap about shared hosting
2013-05-12 08:06:55	qfr	the9th, do you approve of my drawing
2013-05-12 08:07:52	@the9th	The deployment operations are nil. Get an FTP client, code it up, upload that shit to a host -- done. With something like... say, Django... you buy a VPS, you manage Apache in a hands-on way, get mod_wsgi working (a fucking pain in the ass), write up fabric scripts or whatever, or vagrant or chef scripts... it's a full time job basically.

2013-05-12 08:08:12	qfr	How is it a pain
2013-05-12 08:08:14	qfr	It's pretty simple
2013-05-12 08:08:14	@the9th	You need two people by then: one to do devops, and one to do code.
2013-05-12 08:08:28	qfr	Nah it's pretty harmless
2013-05-12 08:08:42	@the9th	Then you're not understanding that the average noobie is unlike you: unfamiliar with intricacies of sysadmining
2013-05-12 08:08:57	@the9th	You've been doing command line probably for what.. 10 years, right?
2013-05-12 08:09:06	@the9th	You're not realizing how difficult it might be for the unexperienced
2013-05-12 08:09:08	qfr	Hm
2013-05-12 08:09:15	qfr	I'm not sure honestly
2013-05-12 08:09:20	qfr	Around 14 maybe
2013-05-12 08:09:29	@almar	lol i used to learn some php when i was like 14 years old
2013-05-12 08:09:31	@almar	never got very far
2013-05-12 08:09:36	qfr	I've written a lot of PHP
2013-05-12 08:09:56	@almar	when i learned html i felt übermensch
2013-05-12 08:10:02	@almar	but i was probably 8 years old.

2013-05-12 19:55:31	@Mike_H	For U.S. Census purposes, Tampa is part of the Tampa-St. Petersburg-Clearwater, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area. The four-county area is composed of roughly 2.9 million residents, making it the second largest metropolitan statistical area (MSA) in the state, and the fourth largest in the Southeastern United States, behind Miami, Washington, D.C., and Atlanta.[14]

2013-05-12 19:56:03	@Mike_H	In 2008, Tampa was ranked as the 5th best outdoor city by Forbes.[17] A 2004 survey by the NYU newspaper Washington Square News ranked Tampa as a top city for "twenty-somethings."[18] Tampa is now ranked as a "Gamma" world city by Loughborough University. According to Loughborough, Tampa ranks alongside other world cities such as Phoenix, Santo Domingo, and Osaka.[19]

2013-05-12 19:56:11	@Mike_H	In recent years Tampa has seen a notable upsurge in high-market demand from consumers, signaling more wealth concentrated in the area.[20] Tampa hosted the 2012 Republican National Convention.[21]

2013-05-12 19:58:05	@chabibi	One whose leg was in need of amputation was faced with the difficulty of surgery without anesthesia. He was offered alcohol to help decrease the pain he would undoubtedly feel but he refused saying: Cut it off while I am in prayer. The amputation was completed while he was in Sujood.

2013-05-13 16:35:10	@orgthingy	but Iranians usually make fun of the accent

2013-05-13 16:36:33	@HannesP	i don't wanna contaminate my iranian persian with dari
2013-05-13 16:36:39	@orgthingy	kehoea, I could take formal lessons instead in Shiraz or wherever
2013-05-13 16:36:40	@kehoea	Narguess Farzad's Teach Yourself Modern Persian is also good
2013-05-13 16:36:59	@orgthingy	Kuwait has direct flights to Kish Island, Shiraz, Mashhad, and Tehran..good stuff
2013-05-13 16:37:01	@orgthingy	I like that
2013-05-13 16:37:11	@orgthingy	kehoea, I was about to go to Kuwait University persian courses
2013-05-13 16:37:19	@orgthingy	but cancelled it last minute since I've temporarily lost my
2013-05-13 16:37:25	@orgthingy	wallet, therefore I couldn't pay for the course
2013-05-13 16:37:31	@kehoea	I've been using Rosetta Stone version 3; version 4 may well have actual contact with natives
2013-05-13 16:37:50	@orgthingy	kehoea, I'm not very optimistic about Rosetta Stone
2013-05-13 16:37:56	@orgthingy	kehoea, have you tried Assimil?
2013-05-13 16:38:03	@HannesP	i'm not impressed with rosetta stone
2013-05-13 16:38:04	@HannesP	at all
2013-05-13 16:38:09	@orgthingy	they've got a course, but for Francophones
2013-05-13 16:38:11	@kehoea	no, orgthingy
2013-05-13 16:38:28	@orgthingy	kehoea, Assimil impresses me, it's really good
2013-05-13 16:38:41	@orgthingy	kehoea, but in the case of Persian, it's only available in the french version of their courses
2013-05-13 16:38:55	@kehoea	HannesP, they try to sell it as a complete learning solution, whereas it really isn't, you need to be consulting textbooks too
2013-05-13 16:39:08	@orgthingy	http://www.amazon.co.uk/Le-Persan-Superpack-Assimil/dp/2700580184/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1368455934&sr=8-1&keywords=Assimil+persian  kehoea
2013-05-13 16:39:10	@HannesP	yeah but in my experience it kinda becomes redundant once you have a good textbook
2013-05-13 16:39:30	@kehoea	but for *drilling*, especially, I find it easier to do that on a computer than on paper
2013-05-13 16:39:52	@kehoea	HannesP, which text do you use?
2013-05-13 16:40:05	@orgthingy	kehoea, what Iranian cities have you visited?
2013-05-13 16:40:15	@HannesP	well i don't have an actual textbook, but i do have an excellent grammar with loads of examples
2013-05-13 16:40:31	@HannesP	and learning through reading short phrases has worked well for me traditionally
2013-05-13 16:40:41	@orgthingy	kehoea, have a look at Assimil, I've never heard a complaint about Assimil courses
2013-05-13 16:41:10	@kehoea	good, HannesP
2013-05-13 16:41:20	@kehoea	not enough of them, orgthingy
2013-05-13 16:41:21	@orgthingy	I still haven't got a grasp on Persian grammar, all I know that it's a SOV language with adjectives coming after nouns
2013-05-13 16:41:41	@orgthingy	kehoea, Esfahan nisf jihan, though I haven't visited it, loads seem to love it
2013-05-13 16:41:45	@HannesP	every now and then i try to read and understand wikipedia articles, my success is ludicrously limited but i get a couple of new words every time
2013-05-13 16:42:03	@orgthingy	HannesP, read BBC Persia instead
2013-05-13 16:42:19	@orgthingy	the lack of online material is really frustrating
2013-05-13 16:42:20	@HannesP	and i firmly believe that vocabulary is crucial, so i spend quite some time on that
2013-05-13 16:42:24	@HannesP	ah good idea orgthingy
2013-05-13 16:42:27	@B-rat	Bogdan__, i dont know
2013-05-13 16:42:47	@Bogdan__	B-rat, he's the mayor of Split.
2013-05-13 16:42:50	@orgthingy	HannesP, since you've used Pimsleur, did it give you a good base on grammar?
2013-05-13 16:43:03	@HannesP	not really
2013-05-13 16:43:15	@HannesP	pimsleur actually refrains form using grammatical terminology and such
2013-05-13 16:43:19	@qfr	orgthingy, why is it that Shi'a verbally pay tribute to the members of ahl al bayt much more than Sunni do? Is this a development linked to the historical disagreement over succession, where the Shi'a sided with ahl al bayt instead of letting the ummah decide?
2013-05-13 16:43:23	@HannesP	and as a linguist i find that quite limited
2013-05-13 16:43:32	@B-rat	Bogdan__, that explains it
2013-05-13 16:43:34	@HannesP	i totally get the point but it's not optimal for me
2013-05-13 16:43:54	@orgthingy	qfr, they consider everything polytheistic, therefore this is a reaction to their "LOLOLOLO MONOTHEISM EVERYTHING ELSE IS BANNED" actions
2013-05-13 16:43:57	@HannesP	s/limited/limiting
2013-05-13 16:44:02	@orgthingy	qfr, we have different ideas on monotheism and what not
2013-05-13 16:44:08	@kehoea	do you know Persian speakers in .sv, HannesP?
2013-05-13 16:44:13	@kehoea	.se, even!
2013-05-13 16:44:16	@qfr	You didn't answer my question
2013-05-13 16:44:24	@HannesP	kehoea: sure, i know a couple
2013-05-13 16:44:32	@orgthingy	qfr, I explained 'why'
2013-05-13 16:44:39	@orgthingy	that's exactly why :P
2013-05-13 16:44:57	@orgthingy	and the answer to the second question is "yes"
2013-05-13 16:45:01	@orgthingy	if that's what you're looking for
2013-05-13 16:45:06	@HannesP	but one of them is terrible annoying, and the other one has so little confidence in her ability to speak her mother tongue
2013-05-13 16:45:09	@HannesP	for some weird reason
2013-05-13 16:45:11	@kehoea	are you getting help from them with your Persian, HannesP? are you at parties where Persian is the usual language?
2013-05-13 16:45:13	@kehoea	ah, OK
2013-05-13 16:45:17	@qfr	A different approach to taw7iid does not explain why Shi'a go wild at public events whenever Mu7ammad or Ali or Imaam Hussain are mentioned
2013-05-13 16:45:33	@qfr	the historical attitude towards the succession would, though

2013-05-13 16:51:39	@saimazoon	so they came and laught and burnt and murdered and took away and went off
2013-05-13 16:51:45	@zocky_	burdand = something like "packed that horses"

2013-05-13 16:52:01	@qfr	Was the same phrase applied to the Iran Iraq war
2013-05-13 16:52:04	@saimazoon	as kushtand sounds like koshtand in modern tehrani persian
2013-05-13 16:52:07	@saimazoon	it means "to take away"

2013-05-13 17:43:06	Mike_HH	(CNN) -- Longtime ABC News personality Barbara Walters will retire from TV journalism in 2014, ABC reported late Sunday, closing a chapter on one of the most storied careers in broadcast journalism history.
2013-05-13 17:43:06	Mike_HH	She is expected to make the announcement Monday on "The View," a daytime talker she created in 1997.
2013-05-13 17:43:06	Mike_HH	Walters, 83, will remain executive producer of that show.
2013-05-13 17:43:08	Mike_HH	hrm
2013-05-13 17:44:05	Mike_HH	At ABC, she began "The Barbara Walters Specials" and "10 Most Fascinating People," which has become a regular year-end program.
2013-05-13 17:44:06	Mike_HH	Walters has interviewed every U.S. president and first lady since Richard and Pat Nixon.

2013-05-13 21:14:22	Mekhitar	in an increasingly digitized world, the tactile experience, the smell of objects, and the satisfaction of looking at something created by your own hand are that much more pronounced
2013-05-13 21:14:23	@B-rat	i'm p sure oxford frowns on the use of sophisticated and hippy in the same sentence
2013-05-13 21:14:27	@almar	CASSOWARIES: the genetic abortion
2013-05-13 21:14:30	@almar	to overcome your laziness
2013-05-13 21:14:31	@CASSOWARIES	are you referring to my impending sex change
2013-05-13 21:14:37	@CASSOWARIES	oh that
2013-05-13 21:14:37	@almar	oh, and that too
2013-05-13 21:14:45	@B-rat	CASSOWARIES, does it take much when you have a cloaca
2013-05-13 21:14:47	@almar	when will you get your vagina?
2013-05-13 21:14:48	@CASSOWARIES	it didn't work, I am still lazy
2013-05-13 21:15:08	@CASSOWARIES	B-rat, yeah they basically just velcro the intracloacal penis there
2013-05-13 21:15:08	Mekhitar	if it were not prohibited by my religion, i think castration might be prudent
2013-05-13 21:15:11	@CASSOWARIES	and problem solved
2013-05-13 21:15:28	@CASSOWARIES	no more embarrassing erections
2013-05-13 21:15:31	@HannesP	Mekhitar: sweden isn't know for its well-working school system so fuckups are to be expected
2013-05-13 21:15:39	@HannesP	i think my school did extremely well generally
2013-05-13 21:15:41	@almar	CASSOWARIES: so you have boobs and all ready?
2013-05-13 21:15:42	@HannesP	in comparison
2013-05-13 21:15:47	@B-rat	i once dreamt that my penis was detachable
2013-05-13 21:15:56	@B-rat	it was so exciting, you would not believe
2013-05-13 21:15:59	@almar	and did you stick it in your ass?
2013-05-13 21:16:06	@B-rat	dont be silly
2013-05-13 21:16:08	@CASSOWARIES	almar: birds don't have boobs
2013-05-13 21:16:12	@B-rat	i stuck it in my mouth first
2013-05-13 21:16:13	Mekhitar	i had a dream once that i bought dried human penises from a street merchant
2013-05-13 21:16:23	@B-rat	Mekhitar, that wasnt a dream, you were in china
2013-05-13 21:16:46	Mekhitar	not only that, CASSOWARIES, but androgen exposure is probably a major contributing factor to the difference in lifespan between men and women
2013-05-13 21:17:01	@CASSOWARIES	are you claiming china isn't fictional
2013-05-13 21:17:06	@CASSOWARIES	also are you gennadius
2013-05-13 21:17:45	@B-rat	i like to imagine the difference is because men lose life energy with each ejaculation
2013-05-13 21:17:51	Mekhitar	if we want to live as long as possible, we should probably get castrated and adopt an ultra low-calorie diet (near starvation) to reduce metabolism, while reducing exposure to free radicals and eliminating certain foods like grains
2013-05-13 21:17:58	@B-rat	that's why i make sure to get my fair share back, orally
2013-05-13 21:18:00	Mekhitar	that's very taoist of you, B-rat
2013-05-13 21:18:10	@B-rat	the tao of b
2013-05-13 21:18:24	@Parth	lmao
2013-05-13 21:18:30	@B-rat	why would i want to live as long as possible with nothing to look forward to
2013-05-13 21:18:31	Mekhitar	caloric restriction works to extend lifespan of rats, so does castration
2013-05-13 21:18:33	@B-rat	such as food and sex
2013-05-13 21:18:42	@B-rat	which are easily in my top 10 things to have
2013-05-13 21:18:42	Mekhitar	you can still eat food, just not in large quantities
2013-05-13 21:18:47	@B-rat	lame
2013-05-13 21:18:59	@B-rat	i'm gonna go eat a doughnut and strawberries
2013-05-13 21:19:03	Mekhitar	and you can still pursue man's highest calling: the contemplation of virtue
2013-05-13 21:19:16	@B-rat	how is mental masturbation different from physical masturbation
2013-05-13 21:19:47	@B-rat	i thought man's highest calling was to watch more AMC series
2013-05-13 21:20:50	Mekhitar	there was a population study done using the birth/death data of a group of korean court eunuchs, comparing them to other males who lived a similar lifestyle
2013-05-13 21:20:56	Mekhitar	the eunuchs lived considerably longer
2013-05-13 21:21:07	@B-rat	how would other males ever live a similar lifestyle
2013-05-13 21:21:50	@B-rat	i guess they could look at linux kernel developers
2013-05-13 21:22:17	Mekhitar	well, in terms of having access to a similar sort of diet, etc., during the same period
2013-05-13 21:22:37	Mekhitar	so, korean gentlemen-scholars and aristocrats and the like
2013-05-13 21:22:40	@B-rat	was it done with 10k people
2013-05-13 21:22:45	@B-rat	10k eunuchs that is
2013-05-13 21:22:46	Mekhitar	several hundred
2013-05-13 21:22:48	Mekhitar	i think
2013-05-13 21:22:54	@B-rat	i dont see how that's statistically significant
2013-05-13 21:22:55	@B-rat	at all
2013-05-13 21:23:26	@B-rat	how come there are no broad studies anymore
2013-05-13 21:23:27	Mekhitar	not even that, 81 :(

2013-05-13 21:23:41	Mekhitar	The average lifespan of eunuchs was 70.0 ± 1.76 years, which was  14.4–19.1 years longer than the lifespan of non-castrated men of similar  socio-economic status.
2013-05-13 21:24:13	Mekhitar	anyway, there are also animal studies that demonstrate the same basic point, using larger sample sizes
2013-05-13 21:24:46	@CASSOWARIES	Bucketecaf: I want to know your progress vis-a-vis the armpit farts
2013-05-13 21:25:17	Mekhitar	 CASSOWARIES are you really transgendered?
2013-05-13 21:25:21	@B-rat	will brown sugar taste good with strawberries
2013-05-13 21:25:28	@B-rat	or should i try to find white sugar
2013-05-13 21:26:02	Mekhitar	brown sugar has a higher molasses content, which would affect the flavors. it might taste funny, but probably not bad
2013-05-13 21:26:09	Bucketecaf	i exceeded the recommendation  CASSOWARIES
2013-05-13 21:26:28	@B-rat	Mekhitar, you do realise that things taste differently combined than separate right?
2013-05-13 21:26:36	@CASSOWARIES	Mekhitar: I don't know if being composed of ratites of multiple genders counts or not
2013-05-13 21:26:48	@CASSOWARIES	Bucketecaf: uh oh are you going to be ok
2013-05-13 21:27:11	Mekhitar	i'd test it with one strawberry, and if you don't like it, stop

2013-05-13 21:29:24	Mekhitar	yeah, basically.

2013-05-13 21:29:55	Mekhitar	ugh, don't get me started on taize. i am anti-ecumenical

2013-05-13 21:30:23	@CASSOWARIES	I had a question but I've forgotten it now
2013-05-13 21:30:39	Mekhitar	a really alarming bangladeshi guy was bothering me with girl questions
2013-05-13 21:30:52	@CASSOWARIES	oh that happens
2013-05-13 21:30:57	Mekhitar	i entertained him for a little bit, but i didn't have the nerve to ask him to stop
2013-05-13 21:31:14	Mekhitar	so i told him i had to use the bathroom, logged off, and used a different handle
2013-05-13 21:31:27	Mekhitar	it wasn't a one-time thing. he would bother me every time i logged on
2013-05-13 21:31:36	Mekhitar	i also didn't have the nerve to use /ignore on him

2013-05-13 21:32:22	Mekhitar	you wouldn't believe the questions he asked, though. he showed me the facebook pages of girls, pictures of their mothers, family members, and asked me to predict how and where they would gain weight based on family members, which one is the best to marry,
2013-05-13 21:32:27	Mekhitar	how their features would combine with his
2013-05-13 21:32:36	@CASSOWARIES	B-rat, very existential

2013-05-13 21:33:13	@CASSOWARIES	was it like an exam
2013-05-13 21:33:15	@CASSOWARIES	did you pass?
2013-05-13 21:33:36	@B-rat	i was considering living in an apartment in the building to the left of the collapsed one
2013-05-13 21:33:37	Mekhitar	no, it wasn't an exam. i think he was using me to masturbate

2013-05-13 21:34:05	@CASSOWARIES	oh right, the earthquake
2013-05-13 21:34:07	@B-rat	no
2013-05-13 21:34:10	@B-rat	this was out of the blue

2013-05-13 21:34:19	@B-rat	no one was in it
2013-05-13 21:34:29	@B-rat	it took 2-3 hours before anyone reported it to the authorities
2013-05-13 21:34:29	@B-rat	heh
2013-05-13 21:34:32	@CASSOWARIES	why is there a bmw logo on that pink pub-looking thing

2013-05-13 21:35:03	@B-rat	this was on the way to the russian store where i bought the candy
2013-05-13 21:35:07	Mekhitar	I would say things like: "Based on these photos, she has an 'hour-glass'-type build, and she would gain weight primarily in the area of the breasts and thighs/buttocks. Weight gain in the waist area would be secondary. When you gain weight, you do not actually gain new fat cells, but existing ones expand. By analogy with her heavy-set sister, I also think she would have a much fuller neck as she gains weight."
2013-05-13 21:35:19	@zocky	it has been there since well before WWII
2013-05-13 21:35:33	@B-rat	i like girls that gain weight in the thighs/buttocks area
2013-05-13 21:35:35	@CASSOWARIES	Mekhitar, whoa, warn us before you paste explicit content

2013-05-13 21:35:46	@B-rat	my friend pointed out some girl on the street that we were passing by
2013-05-13 21:35:51	@B-rat	saying that she used to be of acceptable weight
2013-05-13 21:35:57	@B-rat	he's kind of in worse shape than she was
2013-05-13 21:35:59	@B-rat	comparably
2013-05-13 21:36:20	Mekhitar	"Given that she is an amateur softball player, it would be appropriate to feed her a diet that is energy-rich, such as pasta, and sources of protein (fish, chicken) are also appropriate to facilitate the building of muscle tissue."
2013-05-13 21:36:24	@B-rat	and also i thought she had pretty good curves
2013-05-13 21:36:31	@CASSOWARIES	Mekhitar, I can see why he bothered you about it though
2013-05-13 21:36:32	@B-rat	not like, fat fat
2013-05-13 21:36:44	Mekhitar	because i'm a pushover, CASSOWARIES?

2013-05-13 21:47:49	@zocky	here's the truth: in another universe, physics could be different, but mathematics would be the same. QED.
2013-05-13 21:48:44	@zocky	i think I'll start using res ipsa loquitur more often in casual conversation
2013-05-13 21:49:09	Mekhitar	is music rational?
2013-05-13 21:49:43	@zocky	it's based on fractions, so yes :)
2013-05-13 21:49:56	@B-rat	music has very little in terms of predictable patterns
2013-05-13 21:50:16	@B-rat	describable, sure
2013-05-13 21:50:30	Mekhitar	st. thomas aquinas actually articulated something of a philosophy of music
2013-05-13 21:51:44	Mekhitar	describing it as an entirely autonomous rational science based on numbers, akin to logic and philosophy
2013-05-13 21:52:09	@B-rat	numbers are pretty limited
2013-05-13 21:52:11	@zocky	music is an abuse of the non-verbal communication circuitry
2013-05-13 21:52:40	@zocky	animal calls are based on intervals, not frequencies, because those are easier both to produce and detect accurately
2013-05-13 21:52:44	Mekhitar	i like that suggestion, zocky
2013-05-13 21:53:12	@zocky	so those calls i.e. intervals evoke emotions
2013-05-13 21:53:45	@zocky	and music overloads those functions and you get fine emotional control

2013-05-13 22:10:49	@Mekhitar	interesting, crculver. what's your opinion on the controversy about hungarians in romania? i read something from hungarian nationalists that indicated their cultural autonomy is being undermined
2013-05-13 22:11:26	@crculver	Mekhitar, Hungarians are wiping themselves out by marrying Romanians and having children that only speak Romanian.
2013-05-13 22:11:43	@Mekhitar	so pushback is expected then from some quarters
2013-05-13 22:11:46	@crculver	Mekhitar, There's no organized government attempt to undermine their culture. They do it just fine on their own

2013-05-13 22:12:06	@crculver	Mekhitar, No. Here in Cluj most Hungarians are Unitarians, I believe.

2013-05-13 22:41:15	@Parth	Mekhitar: it's partly true. I can see how a lot of schools are relying more and more on federal funding for scholarships instead of actually trying to, oh my gosh, have fair tuition costs

2013-05-13 22:42:03	zfe	as long as it depends on federal/govt/whatever public funds
2013-05-13 22:42:04	@Mekhitar	well, Parth: tuition has risen far faster than the overall inflation rate, and faster than the wages of academics

2013-05-13 22:45:55	@Parth	zfe: it should just stop. put them back in their places.

2013-05-13 22:46:20	zfe	i'm pretty sure you are gonna find funds somehow
2013-05-13 22:46:44	@Mekhitar	Parth: i think that a restoration of free market dynamics, including individual cost, would be helpful in driving down the cost of education. but it isn't that simple, and even if we were to discover a convenient solution. there is an entire paradigm that is self-sustaining, and will continue until it buckles under its own weight
2013-05-13 22:47:44	@Mekhitar	Parth: i was impressed to learn that students studying in the u.s. from other countries sometimes have interesting arrangements to pay for their education. some indian students are actually sponsored by private companies, who invest in their education---they are required to keep certain grades, study certain subjects---and in the end, they are given employment with the sponsoring firm

2013-05-13 22:49:40	@Mekhitar	anyway, zfe, i was talking earlier about CULTURAL ATTITUDES regarding the aim of education, and the content of education
2013-05-13 22:49:41	zfe	if they spent them to eradicate that level of poverty
2013-05-13 22:49:48	@Mekhitar	it used to be a feature of even the working classes

2013-05-13 22:50:20	@Mekhitar	of a book published a few years

2013-05-13 22:50:28	zfe	i hope there is some hard data
2013-05-13 22:50:35	zfe	and it is not a "oh tempora oh mores" kind of book

2013-05-13 22:51:44	zfe	i'm afraid finding it in istanbul

2013-05-13 22:51:52	@Mekhitar	oh
2013-05-13 22:52:08	@Parth	:P
2013-05-13 22:52:36	@Mekhitar	anyway, it's a good book, and it dispels many myths that we have about the industrial working class being culturally deprived or backward
2013-05-13 22:52:46	@Mekhitar	"high culture" wasn't only for the rich
2013-05-13 22:52:49	zfe	what would it be?
2013-05-13 22:52:54	zfe	can you make an example?
2013-05-13 22:53:25	@Mekhitar	 A Nottingham hosiery worker, remembering his childhood at the beginning  of the 20th century, wrote: "We loved nothing so much when I was a kid  as going to my auntie's and listening to her records - the  Messiah ,  the 'Triumphal March' from  Aida,  Il Trovatore. And a lot of people  read Shaw, the pamphlets and the plays, Robert Blatchford, HG Wells,  Dickens, Thackeray."
2013-05-13 22:53:54	zfe	well, wasn't that obvious
2013-05-13 22:54:03	zfe	i mean, in the past 2 centuries
2013-05-13 22:54:08	zfe	culture was available pretty much to everybody
2013-05-13 22:54:14	zfe	i mean, recordings
2013-05-13 22:54:16	zfe	and such
2013-05-13 22:54:24	zfe	even books have been pretty cheap for like 120-130 years
2013-05-13 22:54:34	@Mike_HH	.wik Greeneville, Tennessee

2013-05-13 22:55:11	@Mekhitar	that's true, zfe. i'm talking specifically about industrial england
2013-05-13 22:55:24	@Mekhitar	as for literate rural culture, that's much more difficult
2013-05-13 22:55:59	@Mekhitar	but there are examples of that too. almar: are you here? i seem to remember reading something before that icelanders in general have a long and rich history of literacy, even during periods they were poor farmers. books were written out by hand, and circulated in that manner
2013-05-13 22:56:11	@BadAtom	paperback book companies like Puffin and Penguin were developed nearly 100 years ago to supply literature to the common rabble in pocket form for the same price as a packet of cigarettes to encourage them to read
2013-05-13 22:56:20	zfe	obviously if you don't have the time and the money to spend 1 year in the states
2013-05-13 22:56:34	zfe	you are not gonna write "democracy in america"
2013-05-13 22:56:49	@Mekhitar	"to encourage them to read" seems a bit of a reach, BadAtom. more like, "to supply demand"
