2013-04-02 14:15:29	wei_	how would you set up cljs to build a module inside of a requirejs project?
2013-04-02 14:36:43	kalasjohnny2000	wei_, try to set the output of your lein cljsbuild auto of your cljs-module in whitespace mode and the let requirejs take care of the advanced compilation of the whole project_
2013-04-02 14:36:45	kalasjohnny2000	?
2013-04-02 14:37:14	kalasjohnny2000	and make sure the output file (.js) is somewhere where requirejs can reach it
2013-04-02 14:37:57	wei_	i see, thanks.
2013-04-02 14:37:58	kalasjohnny2000	I think  the (ns some.thing) just converts to a goog.provide("some.thing")...
2013-04-02 14:38:24	wei_	does that conflict with the package manager for requirejs?
2013-04-02 14:39:57	wei_	also, why not advanced compilation? if you let requirejs take care of minification, then you lose the Closure Library/Closure compiler coupling right?
2013-04-02 14:49:02	kalasjohnny2000	I don't know much about requirejs but according to the website it seems to use google closures mechanism of package managing (the same as clojurescript). RequireJS can use Google Closure Compiler, so if you use it, you can do the whole project minification in requirejs.
2013-04-02 14:49:34	kalasjohnny2000	Don't use any other minification there, if you want to do that, use advanced mode directly in cljsbuild... :)
2013-04-02 14:51:50	kalasjohnny2000	I mean you really want to do advanced compilation somewhere, but do it as late as possible, so you get as much code deleted as possible

2013-04-09 19:17:20	foeniks	so I have this clojurescript html5 canvas game
2013-04-09 19:17:33	foeniks	at least with some fantasy you could call it a game ;)
2013-04-09 19:18:21	foeniks	think of it like a Jump n run game or something alike
2013-04-09 19:18:44	foeniks	I tried to write it to be as stateless as possible but there are a few state variables that I was not able to eliminate
2013-04-09 19:19:07	foeniks	namely the position of the player, viewport, a "zoom" factor, etc.
2013-04-09 19:19:46	foeniks	I put them into a "global/" namespace
2013-04-09 19:20:09	foeniks	but I wonder if there is a functional, idiomatic way to handle global state in such cases
2013-04-09 19:20:59	foeniks	maybe I lack "real" clojure education since I switched to Clojurescript directly without detour via clojure which seems to be the usual way

2013-04-21 11:20:25	deg	I've just started playing with CLJS (coming with some CLJ background, and near-zero web-dev experience of any kind).
2013-04-21 11:20:31	deg	 On the whole, I'm loving the experience; I have my first small app up-and-limping-along already, guided mostly by magomimmo's modern-cljs tutorial.  My next challenge is to figure out how to develop/debug more efficiently.
2013-04-21 11:21:25	deg	Are there any tutorials on how to setup an Emacs environment to give me NREPL-level interaction in a project with a Compojure back-end and CLJS front-end?
2013-04-21 11:28:02	deg	I guess the pieces I'm looking for are include NREPL interacting with a Compojure/Ring server; another Emacs-hosted REPL dealing with the browser; and something that knows to direct compilation of clj files to one and  cljs files to the other.
2013-04-21 11:29:46	Zerker	Have you tried LightTable?
2013-04-21 11:44:30	deg	Nope. Taking a look at it now.
2013-04-21 11:45:45	deg	Hmm, looks VERY interesting. But, looks like it will force me to jump out of Emacs into yet-another-IDE.  Intriguing, but I'm not sure.
2013-04-21 11:46:58	Zerker	I believe it can bind to running emacs instance, thought that may just be a planned feature
2013-04-21 11:47:04	Zerker	a*
2013-04-21 11:47:24	deg	Cool. I will definitely play with it.
2013-04-21 11:48:00	deg	Is LightTable already the standard "best practice" for CLJS dev, or are most folks working in Emacs+NREPL or something else?
2013-04-21 11:48:54	Zerker	It's still in Alpha, so I expect not
2013-04-21 11:49:11	deg	Certainly, anything is better than what I'm doing now:  "lein ring server-headless" in one shell and "lein cljsbuild auto" in another, and stopping the server every time I change the CLJ code.
2013-04-21 11:49:57	deg	Are you using LightTable?
2013-04-21 11:51:00	Zerker	For any Clojure/Cljs stuff I do, that's been a total of about 30 hours so far though :P
2013-04-21 11:51:34	deg	Puts you about 25 hours ahead of me.  :-)
2013-04-21 11:52:18	Zerker	Ah, so your "some Clojure background" is about as formal as mine then?
2013-04-21 11:52:42	deg	Ah, I meant 5 hours in CLJS.  I've been playing with Clojore for a few months, part-time.
2013-04-21 11:53:27	deg	Still not very formal, and I'm still not thrilled with my tool-chain in CLJ either, but at least there I'm past all the learning humps and am reasonably productive in NREPL.
2013-04-21 11:55:03	deg	Did you find it was straightforward to get started in LightTable, or are there setup head-aches?
2013-04-21 11:56:52	Zerker	My exploration has been confined to basic HelloWorlding culminating in a JNI keylogger, and in that scope it's certainly as easy as switching over to instarepl and watching your function's results appear on the right half.
2013-04-21 11:57:09	Zerker	functions'*
2013-04-21 11:58:05	deg	Sounds good.  On the whole, I've been very pleased at how easy it is to config most of the Clojure tools.
2013-04-21 11:58:56	deg	I had some hiccups in the beginning, trying to work in Eclipse on Windows, but once I jumped to a Ubuntu VM and Emacs, the toolchain has been pretty smooth and free of surprises.
