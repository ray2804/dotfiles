2013-08-31 11:01:23	s4muel	sojacques: if you're looking for Clojure's "Rails", no, there isn't one -- and it wouldn't really be very idiomatic.
2013-08-31 11:02:00	sojacques	I'm not looking for rails, but as I saw compojure and korma, I thought that maybe someone made something to generate code
2013-08-31 11:02:17	sojacques	I'm against the idea of a monolithic framework, and more looking for simple tools

2013-08-31 14:12:58	llasram	sheldonh: Because the `& b` means "accept any number of additional arguments and return them as a list".  So each call is (effectively) wrapping the second argument in a second layer of list
2013-08-31 14:13:31	sheldonh	llasram: argh! like a splat in the languages i'm used to. okay thanks!
2013-08-31 14:13:54	llasram	sheldonh: Np.  Something else to note in your function is that Clojure has what's called "nil punning"
2013-08-31 14:14:19	--	kofno_ is now known as kofno
2013-08-31 14:14:20	llasram	The `nil` value isn't *identical* to an empty list (like it is in some Lisps), but you can generally treat it as one
