 *  For example, if we have the following training data:
 *
 *  LABEL       ATTR1   ATTR2   ATTR3   ATTR4   ATTR5
 *  -----       -----   -----   -----   -----   -----
 *  1           0       0.1     0.2     0       0
 *  2           0       0.1     0.3    -1.2     0
 *  1           0.4     0       0       0       0
 *  2           0       0.1     0       1.4     0.5
 *  3          -0.1    -0.2     0.1     1.1     0.1
 *
 *  and bias = 1, then the components of problem are:
 *
 *  l = 5
 *  n = 6
 *
 *  y -&gt; 1 2 1 2 3
 *
 *  x -&gt; [ ] -&gt; (2,0.1) (3,0.2) (6,1) (-1,?)
