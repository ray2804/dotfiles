2013-08-31 11:01:23	s4muel	sojacques: if you're looking for Clojure's "Rails", no, there isn't one -- and it wouldn't really be very idiomatic.
2013-08-31 11:02:00	sojacques	I'm not looking for rails, but as I saw compojure and korma, I thought that maybe someone made something to generate code
2013-08-31 11:02:17	sojacques	I'm against the idea of a monolithic framework, and more looking for simple tools

2013-08-31 14:12:58	llasram	sheldonh: Because the `& b` means "accept any number of additional arguments and return them as a list".  So each call is (effectively) wrapping the second argument in a second layer of list
2013-08-31 14:13:31	sheldonh	llasram: argh! like a splat in the languages i'm used to. okay thanks!
2013-08-31 14:13:54	llasram	sheldonh: Np.  Something else to note in your function is that Clojure has what's called "nil punning"
2013-08-31 14:14:19	--	kofno_ is now known as kofno
2013-08-31 14:14:20	llasram	The `nil` value isn't *identical* to an empty list (like it is in some Lisps), but you can generally treat it as one

2013-09-02 07:34:58	callen	Raynes: Korma is fine.
2013-09-02 07:35:04	Raynes	So is SQL.
2013-09-02 07:35:10	Raynes	So why not just write SQL? :(
2013-09-02 07:35:56	ddellacosta	callen: so, sounds like we know about the same amount about it…d'oh.
2013-09-02 07:36:04	Raynes	The thing about these crazy ass DSLs is that they're designed to provide flexibility that nobody actually uses.

2013-09-02 07:36:35	ddellacosta	Raynes: the answer is that it is handy to have a DSL to generate SQL for you when you are repetitively doing something specific for your domain model
2013-09-02 07:36:46	callen	I need to down a few shots of scotch and then I'll be okay, just give me a minute.
2013-09-02 07:36:53	ddellacosta	callen: hehe
2013-09-02 07:36:59	Raynes	You don't need a DSL for that, you need mustache.

2013-09-02 07:37:46	ddellacosta	now now you two
2013-09-02 07:37:50	aaelony	fwiw, I typically  leave SQL as a string but have different functions for potential where clauses
2013-09-02 07:37:52	Raynes	It's a perfectly suitable solution to this problem.
2013-09-02 07:38:09	ddellacosta	Raynes: it leaves out a lot of the stuff in between, like, validation
2013-09-02 07:38:12	callen	Raynes: mustache is not an acceptable way to structure or manage SQL queries.
2013-09-02 07:38:34	Raynes	I certainly don't think writing it in a Clojure DSL is a suitable way either.

2013-09-02 14:13:55	manutter	I think it's just a convenience. The "dirtiness" of global vars comes from bugs that arise when different parts of the system change the global in different ways

2013-09-02 14:14:09	manutter	but the system in this case doesn't even know about the var
2013-09-02 14:14:26	manutter	It's only ever referenced from the repl, by the developer.
2013-09-02 14:14:51	noidi	yeah, maybe it's ok to think of it as a constant
2013-09-02 14:15:04	manutter	I think of it as a developer tool rather than as code

2013-09-03 18:08:44	technomancy	you can embed nrepl in an application easily enough though
2013-09-03 18:08:52	futile	Basically I'm wondering if I can deploy just an uberjar (per your mailing-list email on Aug 19) and still use lein repl in production.
2013-09-03 18:09:18	technomancy	futile: you would do `lein repl :connect $PORT` rather than `lein repl` but it should still work
2013-09-03 18:09:28	technomancy	or `grench repl` =)

2013-09-03 19:21:53	dnolen	lynaghk: your notes re: analyzer/compiler are a good start but very broad. would like be nice to get smaller actionable chunks. cleaning up closure.clj would be a good start. closure.clj is meant be consumed so solidifying things there would be great. As far as exposing analyzer.clj and compiler.clj I think we need some file above them that provides tooling
