2013-04-19 18:35:16	@bogdan	I'm lucky I follow the right people on Facebook, so I get all the appropriate etymology discussions on current events
2013-04-19 18:35:17	supersym	can someone tell me, what is "starting at", when talking about prices... is that like a quantifier or?
2013-04-19 18:35:43	@msk	bogdan: are you friends with tsarnaev
2013-04-19 18:35:51	@qfr	supersym, it means you start at a certain value and go up from there
2013-04-19 18:35:56	@qfr	Greater or equal to that value
2013-04-19 18:36:07	@qfr	"We have child prostitutes starting at 6 years"

2013-04-19 18:37:52	@msk	why do you want a name for it
2013-04-19 18:37:59	supersym	yeah.. 
2013-04-19 18:38:03	@qfr	I'm not sure there's a mroe specific linguistic name

2013-04-19 18:38:25	@bogdan	msk, no, some Romanian guy.
2013-04-19 18:38:25	supersym	I thought it just had quantifier-like properties since it limits the possible amount of something
2013-04-19 18:38:44	@qfr	Somewhat, but it implies more than that
2013-04-19 18:38:57	supersym	true
2013-04-19 18:39:21	@msk	doesn't stop it from being a quantifier
2013-04-19 18:40:11	supersym	anyway never knew there was a linguistics channel so I thought I'd just ask :) 
2013-04-19 18:40:19	@msk	i don't think it's one though
2013-04-19 18:40:29	@msk	otherwise you could replace it with another quantifier and still make sense
2013-04-19 18:40:35	supersym	I could have also just put it through the berkeley parser I just realised =.

2013-04-23 21:29:22	@Bogdan_	B-rat, then there's the different in pheromones, but that's not really "smell" as you can't feel them conciously.

2013-04-24 07:43:24	@lingbot	the B word: usually used to abbreviate the word bitch to avoid profanity, this expression can also be used by non-committals in reference to avoidance of the term boyfriend. Used in this way emphasizes word boyfriend as being more difficult to say than the word bitch, which if your a bit of a commitmentphobe who is hard-pressed for a relationship commitment is quite likely.

2013-04-24 07:44:52	@lingbot	the Y word: The Y.O. (Yonkers) is one of the chillest places in New York. It&#x27;s basically the Reno of the East Coast because it has a casino, prostitutes, and retarded cops. Every single person from Yonkers is an O.G. So the entire population is O.G., Proof: DMX, Jadakiss, Mary J Blige, and James Blake are all from Yonkers and the guy who invented FM radio, so without the Y.O. there would be no Hot 97. Conclusion: Yonkers is ball

2013-04-24 09:59:45	@saimazoon	well, if you're unsure, just ask me
2013-04-24 09:59:53	@saimazoon	or look it up in an etymological dictionary

2013-04-24 10:02:48	@saimazoon	zfe: turks didn't come up with a written language of their own until the foundation of the republic
2013-04-24 10:03:02	@saimazoon	prior to that point, it was a pastische of persian, arabic and a bit of turkish syntax
2013-04-24 10:03:10	@zfe	i know saimazoon
2013-04-24 10:03:15	@saimazoon	for the sultan's enjoyment, who i'm sure was always illiterate in both of them
2013-04-24 10:03:31	@zfe	i keep thinking though
2013-04-24 10:03:41	@zfe	that the structures taken by persian
2013-04-24 10:03:43	@zfe	could have been kept
2013-04-24 10:03:51	@zfe	as they are far less fucked up
2013-04-24 10:04:46	@zfe	anyway, i'm getting through it
2013-04-24 10:04:52	@zfe	still have some problems with "evidentiality"
2013-04-24 10:04:55	@saimazoon	that's only so if you've got an indo-european language background
2013-04-24 10:05:04	@zfe	but they have the same problems with our "imperfect"
2013-04-24 10:05:05	@saimazoon	zfe: basque has evidentiality markers too
2013-04-24 10:05:10	@saimazoon	and is left-branching, like turkish
2013-04-24 10:05:11	@zfe	and i can understand that it will take years to master it
2013-04-24 10:05:49	@saimazoon	zfe: many languages in the world are left-branching
2013-04-24 10:06:00	@zfe	saimazoon: even latin is rectum-regens
2013-04-24 10:06:02	@saimazoon	japanese and chinese are among the most widely-spoken
2013-04-24 10:06:03	@zfe	which is no big deal
2013-04-24 10:06:11	@zfe	that's the least of problems with turkish
2013-04-24 10:06:12	@saimazoon	i don't know any latin
2013-04-24 10:06:35	@saimazoon	what do you mean by "imperfect"
2013-04-24 10:06:39	@saimazoon	praeteritum imperfectum?
2013-04-24 10:06:49	@saimazoon	ego amaba, tu amabas, el amabat?
2013-04-24 10:07:02	@saimazoon	or the subjunctive
2013-04-24 10:07:06	@zfe	indefinite you must call it in spanish
2013-04-24 10:07:30	@saimazoon	preterito indefinido
2013-04-24 10:07:36	@saimazoon	that's like the simple past tense
2013-04-24 10:07:52	@saimazoon	it's a perfective tense, says the action is finished, and that it happened in the past
2013-04-24 10:08:08	@saimazoon	yo dije = söyledim
2013-04-24 10:08:23	@zfe	what's the difference in spanish then
2013-04-24 10:08:25	@zfe	between
2013-04-24 10:08:31	@zfe	yo he olvidado
2013-04-24 10:08:33	@saimazoon	yo decıa = söylüyordum
2013-04-24 10:08:38	@zfe	and yo olvidaba
2013-04-24 10:08:48	@saimazoon	yo he olvidado = yo olvide
2013-04-24 10:08:55	@saimazoon	people in the north tend to use the simple form more often
2013-04-24 10:08:57	@zfe	exactly the same?
2013-04-24 10:09:02	@saimazoon	and people in centre and south of spain, the compound tense
2013-04-24 10:09:02	@saimazoon	yes
2013-04-24 10:09:06	@saimazoon	it's pretty much like in german
2013-04-24 10:09:06	@zfe	that's curious
2013-04-24 10:09:14	@saimazoon	ich haben gesehen and ich sah
2013-04-24 10:09:19	@zfe	how do you say "when i was young i went to school blablabal"
2013-04-24 10:09:20	@saimazoon	or in romanian
2013-04-24 10:09:34	@saimazoon	eu am zis and .... i don't remember how to use the simple past in romanian, because it's very bookish
2013-04-24 10:09:38	@saimazoon	oh
2013-04-24 10:09:39	@saimazoon	yeah
2013-04-24 10:09:41	@saimazoon	that's quite another thing
2013-04-24 10:09:46	@saimazoon	yo he olvidado and yo olvide are perfective tenses
2013-04-24 10:09:53	@saimazoon	they tell you the action is done and finished
2013-04-24 10:09:54	@zfe	that's what i wanted to mean
2013-04-24 10:10:03	@zfe	turks have hard time understanding
2013-04-24 10:10:07	@zfe	indefinite past
2013-04-24 10:10:12	@Lysandros	"he olvidado" does not have the same uses as "olvidaba"
2013-04-24 10:10:13	@saimazoon	imperfective, "yo olvidaba" is more like "i was forgetting" or "I kept forgetting"
2013-04-24 10:10:20	@zfe	which at least in italian and latin mean
2013-04-24 10:10:25	@saimazoon	zfe: i don't think they do
2013-04-24 10:10:28	@zfe	1. routine actions in the past
2013-04-24 10:10:39	@saimazoon	i think turkish as tenses that translate pretty smoothly into spanish conjugations
2013-04-24 10:10:39	@zfe	and here they get it, cause turkish has a similar form
2013-04-24 10:10:47	@saimazoon	unuttum = yo olvidé
2013-04-24 10:10:47	@zfe	you use aor+past
2013-04-24 10:10:50	@zfe	gelirdim
2013-04-24 10:10:59	@zfe	giderdim
2013-04-24 10:11:00	@zfe	and such
2013-04-24 10:11:06	@saimazoon	unutuyordum = yo olvidaba
2013-04-24 10:11:16	@zfe	that would translate more like
2013-04-24 10:11:20	@zfe	"i was forgetting"
2013-04-24 10:11:26	@zfe	not "i used to forget"
2013-04-24 10:11:36	@saimazoon	that isn't the imperfective, zfe
2013-04-24 10:11:40	@saimazoon	gelirdim is the 'aorist'
2013-04-24 10:11:50	@zfe	saimazoon: turkish has no concept of "imperfective"
2013-04-24 10:11:52	@zfe	whatsoever
2013-04-24 10:12:07	@zfe	that's why they have problems, just like we have problems understanding the whole range of meanings and uses of mish
2013-04-24 10:12:16	@saimazoon	zfe: let's use an english example as a translation basis for this
2013-04-24 10:12:25	@saimazoon	"when you came by i was having a shower"
2013-04-24 10:12:33	@saimazoon	sen gelince ben dus aliyordum
2013-04-24 10:12:37	@Lysandros	"he olvidado dónde dejé las llaves" I forgot where I put my keys "olvidaba dónde había dejado las llaves" I had forgotten/~was forgetting were I had put the keys [but not anymore]
2013-04-24 10:13:05	@zfe	weird Lysandros
2013-04-24 10:13:11	@zfe	for the second case italian wouldn't use imperfective
2013-04-24 10:13:29	@Lysandros	we can use "había olvidado" in the second case too
2013-04-24 10:13:36	@Lysandros	maybe imperfective is an informal/less correct use
2013-04-24 10:13:45	@zfe	we use the second imperfective
2013-04-24 10:13:45	@saimazoon	I had told you not to go to work = isyerine gitmemeni sana soylemistim
2013-04-24 10:13:48	@zfe	"avevo dimenticato"
2013-04-24 10:15:21	@saimazoon	zfe: mapping turkish tenses to romance ones is fairly smooth in my view
2013-04-24 10:15:27	@saimazoon	it's way harder with other languages, even IE ones
2013-04-24 10:15:28	@saimazoon	like russian
2013-04-24 10:15:30	@zfe	it is not saimazoon
2013-04-24 10:15:31	@saimazoon	which only have two tenses
2013-04-24 10:15:36	<--	Quix0te (~Quix0te@unaffiliated/quix0te) has quit
2013-04-24 10:16:00	@zfe	i had ~1000h teaching itaian to turks by now
2013-04-24 10:16:16	@saimazoon	but you teach plebs, zfe
2013-04-24 10:16:18	@saimazoon	what do you expect
2013-04-24 10:16:29	@zfe	no, i teach to people coming from the best education you can get in this country
2013-04-24 10:16:33	@BadAtom	I thought he taught bored rich brats
2013-04-24 10:17:04	@saimazoon	and you taught yourself turkish using european learning sources
2013-04-24 10:17:04	@saimazoon	the turks you teach are trying to learn your language using sources written in turkish
2013-04-24 10:17:05	@saimazoon	you just can't compare
2013-04-24 10:17:14	@saimazoon	<BadAtom> I thought he taught bored rich brats
2013-04-24 10:17:22	@saimazoon	BadAtom: because that's what he said at some point
2013-04-24 10:17:54	@saimazoon	zfe:
2013-04-24 10:17:58	@saimazoon	imagine a turk learning english
2013-04-24 10:18:03	@saimazoon	fucked up spelling
2013-04-24 10:18:05	@zfe	no, my students are not using turkish resources
2013-04-24 10:18:21	@saimazoon	a host of loan words imported from latin that just don't fit in the overall language feeling
2013-04-24 10:18:38	@saimazoon	turkish is always left-branching, but english places adjectives before words
2013-04-24 10:18:45	@saimazoon	and relative clauses after other nouns
2013-04-24 10:18:50	@saimazoon	does that seem coherent to you?
2013-04-24 10:19:00	@zfe	saimazoon: i'm not accusing turkish of not being coherent
2013-04-24 10:19:25	@zfe	indeed, the language is so coherent that it seems obvious that it was taken from a dialect spoken by people from all around a vast area
2013-04-24 10:19:42	@saimazoon	vast area = istanbul
2013-04-24 10:19:44	@zfe	it seems they patched together the minimum level
2013-04-24 10:19:52	@saimazoon	even the old dialect of ankara sounded closer to azeri
2013-04-24 10:20:02	@saimazoon	they had both q and x
2013-04-24 10:20:03	@zfe	saimazoon: with people getting in from  all around the empire
2013-04-24 10:20:13	@zfe	saimazoon: modern ankara dialect, sivas dialect and such
2013-04-24 10:20:24	@zfe	are closer, if we take the russian loans out, to azeri than to istanbul turkish
2013-04-24 10:20:48	@zfe	if we can call them dialects
2013-04-24 10:21:07	@saimazoon	i'm sure you can understand azer without serious difficulty
2013-04-24 10:21:14	@zfe	spoken no
2013-04-24 10:21:17	@zfe	written yes
2013-04-24 10:21:46	@saimazoon	zfe: removing both the 'q' and 'x' sounds from the spoken standard was a blunder in my opinion
2013-04-24 10:22:00	@saimazoon	because many people in central and eastern turkey still use them
2013-04-24 10:22:05	@zfe	well, x is not exactly removed
2013-04-24 10:22:07	@zfe	even in istanbul dialect
2013-04-24 10:22:16	@saimazoon	and all turkic languages in central asia have them anyway
2013-04-24 10:22:18	@zfe	pay attention to how they say gelmek vs almak
2013-04-24 10:22:28	@zfe	the k in almak is rather an x
2013-04-24 10:22:36	@zfe	ops q
2013-04-24 10:23:08	@saimazoon	when a word has only  front vowels and ends in 'k', that sound is usually palatalised
2013-04-24 10:23:10	@saimazoon	in fact it always is
2013-04-24 10:23:28	@zfe	just like they have two L
2013-04-24 10:23:32	@zfe	and they obviously don't write it
2013-04-24 10:23:52	MrQuist	dru
2013-04-24 10:24:03	@saimazoon	they don't bother doing it because palatalised vs non-palatalised pronunciation isn't phonemic
2013-04-24 10:24:17	@saimazoon	and their occurrence is predictable
2013-04-24 10:24:25	@saimazoon	palatalisation happens in words with front vowels
2013-04-24 10:24:34	@zfe	you should see how hard it is
2013-04-24 10:24:36	@zfe	to remove the back L
2013-04-24 10:24:36	@saimazoon	just as the velarised L occurs in words with back vowels
2013-04-24 10:24:40	@zfe	while they are speaking italian
2013-04-24 10:24:54	@saimazoon	zfe: the english do right the same thing when they speak spanish
2013-04-24 10:25:03	@saimazoon	they can't get rid of the velarised 'l'
2013-04-24 10:25:13	@saimazoon	and if you try to explaion to them what they're doing 'wrong', they just don't understand
2013-04-24 10:25:50	@zfe	i use a section of the palate
2013-04-24 10:25:54	@zfe	to show them what they do
2013-04-24 10:25:57	@zfe	they usually ge it

2013-04-24 10:52:25	@B-rat	was it
2013-04-24 10:52:29	@BadAtom	it was?
2013-04-24 10:53:12	@B-rat	i remember having to upload shit online and then fetch it on the phone's abismal browser
2013-04-24 10:53:14	@msk	yes
2013-04-24 10:53:21	@B-rat	now i just connect it via usb
2013-04-24 10:53:27	@msk	back in the day you could just connect it via usb and transfer files like a normal device
2013-04-24 10:53:39	@B-rat	msk is benjamin button
2013-04-24 10:53:58	@msk	then they invented MTP and ruined everything
2013-04-24 10:54:09	@B-rat	i can still transfer it via USB
2013-04-24 10:54:27	@B-rat	i just needed to install drivers first cause apparently phone manufacturers are too dumb to learn how usb drives normally work
2013-04-24 10:54:33	@Lysandros	my shitty mobile is connected via USB and seen as an external drive if needed
2013-04-24 10:54:46	@B-rat	and i think that's just cause i dont have an sd card
2013-04-24 10:54:59	@msk	my new phone needs an app to transfer files
2013-04-24 10:55:02	@B-rat	the internal memory cant be accessed normally because of safety issues
2013-04-24 10:55:05	@msk	sadly the app doesn't work on os x
2013-04-24 10:55:07	@BadAtom	now you can just transfer via wifi
2013-04-24 10:55:09	@B-rat	you should've gotten a better phone
2013-04-24 10:55:11	@Lysandros	brand?
2013-04-24 10:55:12	@BadAtom	or bluetooth
2013-04-24 10:55:19	@B-rat	you could also just install dropbox on it
2013-04-24 10:55:26	@msk	i tried wifi but it doesn't work either
2013-04-24 10:55:27	@B-rat	or your preferred sync software
2013-04-24 10:55:42	@msk	plus it's ridiculous to have to use wifi when you have physical access to the computer
2013-04-24 10:56:13	@msk	it's also ridiculous to have to transfer files to the cloud and then back
2013-04-24 10:56:17	@msk	esp. when it's music
2013-04-24 10:56:33	@BadAtom	how is that more ridiculous than using wifi when your computer has physical access to your router
2013-04-24 10:56:44	@msk	but it doesn't
2013-04-24 10:56:58	@B-rat	buy a better phone
2013-04-24 10:56:58	@msk	and that'd be ridiculous, yes
2013-04-24 10:57:01	@BadAtom	it's not transferring files to the cloud, it's a LAN connection
2013-04-24 10:57:10	@msk	i meant the dropbox suggestion
2013-04-24 10:57:13	@B-rat	my sister's htc just acted like a usb storage device
2013-04-24 10:57:28	@B-rat	now she's got some kind of weird unbreakable phone, dunno if it works the same with that one or not
2013-04-24 10:57:32	@msk	my old phone was like that as well
2013-04-24 10:57:40	@msk	but no, that was too simple
2013-04-24 10:57:43	@B-rat	xcover or something
2013-04-24 10:57:51	@B-rat	does it have an sd card, msk
2013-04-24 10:57:59	@msk	yes

2013-04-24 10:58:28	@msk	i did but i thought that problem had been solved
2013-04-24 10:58:32	@BadAtom	so why can't you just use USB to transfer files
2013-04-24 10:58:34	@B-rat	hahaha
2013-04-24 10:58:41	@msk	because there's no way to do that

2013-04-24 15:38:47	@neeku	why should something happen to them buying something qfr ?
2013-04-24 15:38:49	@zfe	now i have this doubt
2013-04-24 15:38:52	@zfe	is listerine haram?
2013-04-24 15:38:57	@talib	haha
2013-04-24 15:38:58	@zfe	cause "islamic shops" here don't sell it
2013-04-24 15:38:59	@talib	yes
2013-04-24 15:39:33	@qfr	neeku, because use of tampons is not compatible with leaving the hymen intact
2013-04-24 15:39:39	@neeku	why do you hang out in islamic shops zfe ? :D

2013-04-24 15:40:14	@talib	qfr, you didn't like my jail link? :(
2013-04-24 15:40:30	@neeku	qfr, yes, but nothing special happens if someone walks to store and picks one. also nothing happens if they use them, except that they lose the hymen. but that can have side effects later when they want to marry
2013-04-24 15:40:54	@neeku	i see zfe . jk. :)
2013-04-24 15:41:02	@talib	qfr, they probably just use pads, if that's a concern

2013-04-24 15:42:30	@neeku	so they use pads.

2013-04-24 15:44:52	@zfe	neeku: it's the obvious sign
2013-04-24 15:44:56	@zfe	of the existence of god
2013-04-24 15:45:01	@neeku	(from both theist and atheist aspects)

2013-04-24 15:46:14	@Lysandros	neeku, I believe some theories claim it's a protection against bacteria
2013-04-24 15:46:44	@neeku	hahahaha zfe . it does, with very detailed, step-by-step ones. but that's a religious way of thinking which does not exist on your side of the world. so how would an atheist would explain it?
2013-04-24 15:46:45	@Lysandros	but I don't know how scientific that is
2013-04-24 15:46:47	@neeku	yes hamid

2013-04-24 15:47:23	@qfr	I'm not sure there's consensus on the evolutionary significance of the human hymen

2013-04-24 15:47:31	@qfr	Apparently we're the only mammal that has it
2013-04-24 15:47:43	@zfe	why people misunderstand evolutionism so much?
2013-04-24 15:47:46	@Lysandros	zfe, it would protect BEFORE having sex, obviously, but I don't know, really, it's just something I remember reading a while ago

2013-04-24 15:47:55	@Lysandros	maybe it was on 4chan and I don't remember the details

2013-04-24 15:48:54	@qfr	They only have it in fetuses

2013-04-24 16:01:03	@neeku	because here's an islamic country with an islamic government

2013-04-24 16:10:55	@neeku	if a couple want to get diverced during engagement, if the woman has the hymen, she gets half the money from the man, and the man's name is removed from the woman's birth certificate to prove that she's never married!

2013-04-24 16:12:40	@talib	if the woman doesn't have the hymen, she gets stoned to death.
2013-04-24 16:12:52	@neeku	that's why having sex even during marriage is not allowed!
2013-04-24 16:13:05	@Clint	hooray for marriage
2013-04-24 16:13:21	@talib	neeku, do women smuggle dildoes into the country?
2013-04-24 16:13:44	@neeku	no talib but the man has the right to divorce her just because she does not have the hymen, which can be lost during some accident, but not even sex!

2013-04-24 17:37:15	bogdan	qfr, the rate of mutation is pretty much the same.
2013-04-24 17:37:49	bogdan	qfr, which is how they can tell when HIV started infecting humans (decades before AIDS being noticed).
2013-04-24 17:38:02	@qfr	bogdan, Wikipedia says y chromosomes have a far higher rate of mutation than the other human chromosomes
2013-04-24 17:39:17	bogdan	qfr, it talks about the total mutation rate, not that due to background radiation.
2013-04-24 17:39:38	@qfr	Isn't mutation to radiation very rare
2013-04-24 17:39:43	@qfr	I thought it was mostly errors during copying

2013-04-24 17:42:35	@qfr	So with y haplogroups it's basically just small markers that somehow survived the faulty process

2013-04-25 06:13:17	@lingbot	soft cock: A person, usually a man, who lacks strength of character, or who is an easy touch for a sob story, or who cannot be relied on to take decisive action. Usually a sycophant.

2013-04-25 07:52:33	@Spaceghost	Well, maybe that sensation I had when I was reading Demian, maybe ever the end was bad in comparision to its plot.

2013-04-25 07:54:24	@Spaceghost	In Spanish, why the question?
2013-04-25 07:54:49	@BadAtom	just curious, because Hesse is usually considered advanced reading
2013-04-25 07:55:51	@Spaceghost	Being German I didn't find much sense reading it at English but also I never read a serious book in English, I would like try with Orwell.

2013-04-25 09:57:47	@msk	they don't have a masculine and a feminine
2013-04-25 09:58:21	@msk	haha
2013-04-25 09:58:21	@msk	A subtler strategy of gender-neutralizing pronouns is the replacement of man (which means either man or one, as in: One ought to gender-neutralize pronouns) with en (which, literally translated, means one). Fact is that en is already used in some dialects and contexts as a replacement for man and some native speakers of Swedish would thus consider the word as belonging to regional or low-prestige

2013-04-25 10:02:36	@msk	According to the PCIG proposal, Spanish and Portuguese speakers can pronounce the at-sign using the phoneme /ɔ/ and the ligature with /ɛ/.
2013-04-25 10:02:39	@msk	oh dear
2013-04-25 10:02:50	@msk	However, some Spanish speakers are concerned that this proposal is unlikely to be adopted, since the Spanish language does not distinguish /ɔ/ and /ɛ/ from /o/ and /e/ respectively, and most of its speakers would therefore not even notice a difference in pronunciation.
2013-04-25 10:03:15	@msk	that'd be hard to do in portuguese as well
2013-04-25 10:03:28	@msk	[O] is something we only do in stressed syllables
2013-04-25 10:03:54	@msk	The phoneme [ɔ] is between the [a] characteristic of feminine nouns and the [o] characteristic of masculine nouns in the scale of vowel height, which can be characterized symbolic of gender inclusion. Analogously, the "gender-inclusive" [ɛ] is intermediate step between the "feminine" [a] and the "masculine" [e].

2013-04-25 10:09:11	@BadAtom	"One part of bringing hen into the Swedish language is by publishing a gender neutral book for children. It’s called “Kivi och monsterhund” (Kivi and monster dog) and is written by Jesper Lundqvist. It’s filled with hens, mappor (Mother = mamma, Father = pappa) morbroster (Uncle = morbror, Aunt = moster)  and bröstrar (Brothers = bröder, Sisters = systrar)."

2013-04-25 10:14:18	@msk	there's also Gebrüder which apparently isn't used anymore
2013-04-25 10:14:54	@BadAtom	ge + schwester, to form an aggregate noun
2013-04-25 10:15:29	@msk	what's up with ge
2013-04-25 10:15:48	@BadAtom	the scandinavian languages have something similar, swedish syskon and icelandic systkin, sister-kin
2013-04-25 10:20:25	@B-rat	So instead we might say, "Every child has their monkey," even though it's not grammatically correct.

2013-04-25 10:26:59	@B-rat	Yoette - A young black female. Unlike "yo", the term doesn't refer to the individuals as criminals. Not very gender neutral.
2013-04-25 10:28:12	@B-rat	"As far as the whole 'yo'-option is concerned, from the clips played, the kids sounded a lot more like they were speaking a dialect of 'Smurf' with 'Smurf' replaced with 'yo' rather than specifically addressing the pronoun issues English had (in the past)."

2013-04-25 11:37:11	@msk	There is no reason other than massive taxation of more than 50 percent and consumer naivete that thinks paying the sticker price of a BMW X5 is the same value as buying a Cherokee.  Sorry, Brazukas…there is no status in a Toyota Corolla, Honda Civic, Jeep Grand or Dodge Durango. Don’t be fooled by the sticker price. You’re definitely getting ripped off.

FSI would be "start out with 3 sets of 10 reps at X pounds three times per week, and run Y miles per day."

2013-04-25 14:45:21	@B-rat	if a company only sells some phones with a contract (at least as advertised on their site), can you still buy them without one and pay the full price
2013-04-25 14:45:24	@B-rat	i'm assuming you probably can
2013-04-25 14:45:35	@talib	yes
2013-04-25 14:45:37	@talib	of course
2013-04-25 14:45:44	@talib	you can buy the phone outright
2013-04-25 14:46:15	@B-rat	i dont know why the manufacturers dont just sell the phones themselves
2013-04-25 14:46:23	@B-rat	all this contract business is confusing
2013-04-25 14:48:04	@B-rat	msk, did you get a new phone when you got there or what
2013-04-25 14:48:17	@msk	no, i got it a few weeks ago
2013-04-25 14:48:34	@B-rat	what did you do before then
2013-04-25 14:48:52	@msk	i already had a phone
2013-04-25 14:48:54	@B-rat	use your phone from brazil, how did the carrier fees etc affect you across continents
2013-04-25 14:49:08	@msk	i bought a sim card and put it in my phone
2013-04-25 14:49:20	@B-rat	so like a prepaid thing
2013-04-25 14:49:21	@no-n	http://eatliveburp.net/2012/12/28/masala-coke/
2013-04-25 14:49:23	@msk	i have a contract now but it's not tied to the phone
2013-04-25 14:50:03	@B-rat	some phones are apparently locked as far as network providers go
2013-04-25 14:50:14	@B-rat	that seems like a silly idea
2013-04-25 14:50:14	@msk	yes
2013-04-25 14:50:15	@msk	it's not a silly idea
2013-04-25 14:50:21	@msk	it allows them to sell phones for $1
2013-04-25 14:50:25	@B-rat	mine isnt afaik, when i was in italy and croatia it just told me i was on a vodafone partner network
2013-04-25 14:50:38	@msk	that's not what being locked means
2013-04-25 14:50:39	@B-rat	and my fee was like, not a whole lot different than normal
2013-04-25 14:50:42	@B-rat	well
2013-04-25 14:50:47	@msk	being locked means that if you put a different sim card it won't work
2013-04-25 14:50:47	@B-rat	if there werent a vodafone partner there
2013-04-25 14:50:55	@B-rat	oh
2013-04-25 14:50:58	@B-rat	wot
2013-04-25 14:51:11	@B-rat	but it doesnt come with a sim card when you buy it
2013-04-25 14:51:16	@B-rat	or does it
2013-04-25 14:51:30	@msk	it does if you buy it in these crazy $1 deals
2013-04-25 14:51:33	@B-rat	or are sim cards vendor locked or something
2013-04-25 14:51:39	@B-rat	i bought my phone for 1€
2013-04-25 14:51:41	@talib	B-rat, yeah, network locking does occur
2013-04-25 14:51:46	@B-rat	i'm using my... 10 year old? sim card
2013-04-25 14:52:04	@msk	they don't come vendor-locked but the phone company can do that
2013-04-25 14:52:06	@B-rat	this is all so ridiculous, talib
2013-04-25 14:52:22	@B-rat	phones should be separate from sims and that should be separate from network providers
2013-04-25 14:52:23	@talib	B-rat, just buy the phone outright, then you can use it with any network
2013-04-25 14:52:24	@B-rat	like, completely
2013-04-25 14:52:29	@B-rat	yeah
2013-04-25 14:52:36	@talib	that's what i've always done
2013-04-25 14:52:39	@B-rat	bit expensive but worth it
2013-04-25 14:52:43	@talib	fuck being locked to contracts
2013-04-25 14:52:55	@msk	i don't know what the status of this is in brazil now, i think it's illegal
2013-04-25 14:53:05	@msk	before that they were allowed to lock it for 1 year
2013-04-25 14:55:00	@msk	it should've been illegal all along anyway
2013-04-25 14:55:06	@msk	since product tying is illegal
2013-04-25 14:56:07	@B-rat	hmm optus doesnt give you an option on their site for buying the phone outright if it's one that comes with a plan
2013-04-25 14:56:15	@talib	fuck optus
2013-04-25 14:56:31	@talib	unless you're certain you want them

2013-04-25 17:17:23	Bogdan_	but somehow, Montenegro is outside of it.
2013-04-25 17:18:08	@zocky	Bogdan_, maybe slovenia too, so maybe it's "western balkans" with albania and montenegro treated as italian provinces

2013-04-25 17:20:08	@B-rat	Speed, i heard the only gay bar in ljubljana has plenty of fights all the time because some people are apparently huge douchebags
2013-04-25 17:20:16	@B-rat	and that one time someone threw a brick through a window or something

2013-04-25 17:21:18	@zocky	B-rat, yeah, but the bar is a more common target than individual gay people

2013-04-25 21:29:39	@msk	Die "New York Daily News" folgerte sogleich, Paltrow sei "commando" unterwegs - eine englische Umschreibung für fehlende Unterwäsche. Das Boulevardblatt scheint derzeit ohnehin mit der Schauspielerin auf Kriegsfuß zu stehen. Auf ihre Wahl zum schönsten Menschen reagierte die Zeitung mit einer eigenen bitterbösen Liste: "Fünf Gründe, warum Gwyneth Paltrow nicht die schönste Frau der Welt
2013-04-25 21:29:39	@kehoea	»Der Name ist keltischer Herkunft. Er setzt sich zusammen aus gwyn ‚weiß, schön‘ und dolen ‚Bogen, Kreis‘. Gwendolin ist ein in walisischen Sagen beliebter Name von Frauen und Feen. Der Bestandteil dolin kann im Walisischen auch mit ‚Blume‘ übersetzt werden, der Name würde dann ‚weiße Blume‘ oder auch ‚schöne Blume‘ bedeuten, was in Zusammenhang mit der Feennamensgebung einen tieferen Sinn ergibt.«

2013-04-25 21:42:59	@pwca	my impression is that most people who build muscle do so to compensate for something.
2013-04-25 21:43:21	@pwca	either they've no personality and build muscle to have some defining characteristic.
2013-04-25 21:43:30	@pwca	or they were picked on as a child.
2013-04-25 21:43:40	@pwca	or they're really terrified of other people.
2013-04-25 21:43:41	@msk	that's a terrible excuse not to build muscle

2013-04-26 00:22:32	norf	I love how people invariably react to totalitarianism by going totalitarian in the other way.
