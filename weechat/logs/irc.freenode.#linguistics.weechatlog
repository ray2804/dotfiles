2013-04-19 18:34:46	@bogdan	it means "jewel".
2013-04-19 18:34:49	@msk	it's still a republic
2013-04-19 18:35:16	@bogdan	I'm lucky I follow the right people on Facebook, so I get all the appropriate etymology discussions on current events
2013-04-19 18:35:17	supersym	can someone tell me, what is "starting at", when talking about prices... is that like a quantifier or?
2013-04-19 18:35:43	@msk	bogdan: are you friends with tsarnaev
2013-04-19 18:35:51	@qfr	supersym, it means you start at a certain value and go up from there
2013-04-19 18:35:56	@qfr	Greater or equal to that value
2013-04-19 18:36:07	@qfr	"We have child prostitutes starting at 6 years"
2013-04-19 18:37:04	supersym	@qfr: ah I know that... I was talking the classification in linguistics for those type of words
2013-04-19 18:37:13	@qfr	Oh.
2013-04-19 18:37:26	@qfr	Verb and preposition? ;o
2013-04-19 18:37:35	supersym	in treebank I guess?? Im no linguist :) and no idea how to google it
2013-04-19 18:37:52	@msk	why do you want a name for it
2013-04-19 18:37:59	supersym	yeah.. 
2013-04-19 18:38:03	@qfr	I'm not sure there's a mroe specific linguistic name
2013-04-19 18:38:04	supersym	god... dont ask :D
2013-04-19 18:38:25	@bogdan	msk, no, some Romanian guy.
2013-04-19 18:38:25	supersym	I thought it just had quantifier-like properties since it limits the possible amount of something
2013-04-19 18:38:44	@qfr	Somewhat, but it implies more than that
2013-04-19 18:38:57	supersym	true
2013-04-19 18:39:21	@msk	doesn't stop it from being a quantifier
2013-04-19 18:40:11	supersym	anyway never knew there was a linguistics channel so I thought I'd just ask :) 
2013-04-19 18:40:19	@msk	i don't think it's one though
2013-04-19 18:40:29	@msk	otherwise you could replace it with another quantifier and still make sense
2013-04-19 18:40:35	supersym	I could have also just put it through the berkeley parser I just realised =.
