2013-04-23 20:49:39	jParkton	I can understand to an extent but when someone corrects English it should not be simply "Haha you say wrong, you dumb foreigner" it should be more for clarity, ask questions don't just point and laugh

2013-04-23 21:04:06	GarethAdams	the key to tabular data is that every item in a column, and every item in a row, are related in some way
2013-04-23 21:04:11	Qbix1	tables for layout is one thing. But why do people go out of their way to use divs and li's for things that clearly have several fields?

2013-04-24 22:02:55	yoshie902a	Hi all, emergency. we just launched a website and now we are getting calls that it does not work in IE 8 and before.   Are there resources to run tests on what code is incompatible?  Also, is there a way to extract the rendered CSS directly from the browser to eliminate any media queries?
2013-04-24 22:02:57	Cow_woC	aFeijo: Not sure, but you could use JS to remove the transition before fading back on, then re-set the transition again.

I have used debug tools for firefox/chrome on mac (my machine) and was hoping for a tool to down load a rendered version of the CSS, with the media query stuff removed and only show the CSS specific to the current view.  Is there any way to do this?

2013-04-25 00:58:51	jParkton	ohai
2013-04-25 00:59:08	Cow_woC	What's a good way to implement a fixed-size column on the right, and a dynamic-sized column on the left that grows to fill the remaining space?

2013-04-25 00:59:19	Cow_woC	reisio, jParkton: Hi guys :)
2013-04-25 00:59:34	Cow_woC	I tried http://stackoverflow.com/q/16201617/14731 but as you can see I ran into some nasty bugs.
2013-04-25 01:00:04	Cow_woC	Is there a way to implement this without some hacky margin-right?

2013-04-25 01:02:32	jParkton	no clue really, as with all things programming if $A doesnt work as expected use $B
2013-04-25 01:02:58	reisio	Cow_woC: ordinary float: http://css.maxdesign.com.au/floatutorial/
2013-04-25 01:03:26	Cow_woC	reisio: I tried that, but it doesn't jive well with max-width/height on the left column
2013-04-25 01:03:58	reisio	how so?
2013-04-25 01:04:14	Cow_woC	reisio: Meaning, when you shrink the window horizontally, eventually the float needs to squeeze the left column but instead one just goes into one row and another into another row.

2013-04-25 01:05:36	Cow_woC	reisio: I want the columns to always extend from top to bottom. The left column fills the remaining space (down to 0). The right column always keeps its width.

2013-04-25 01:06:58	Cow_woC	The right column should have a width from say 200px down to 0px. It should also shrink as the window shrinks, but it should only begin shrinking after the left column has a width of 0.

2013-04-25 01:08:21	Cow_woC	I just changed my mind :) Okay... so I guess what I want is *both* columns to shrink to fit the screen... kind of like left column has 80%, right column 20%, but I also want to cap the maximum size of the right to say 200px. Is it possible to mix width: 20%, max-width: 200px?
2013-04-25 01:09:41	Cow_woC	Hmm, that worked :)
2013-04-25 01:10:07	reisio	gj
2013-04-25 01:10:17	Cow_woC	Sorry, nevermind then. I only thought about the 80/20% thing a few minutes ago. I was trying to use fixed width on the right before without giving the left a width.

2013-04-25 07:29:11	AMcBain	The silly thing is there's a picture-hosting site for a certain interest group built on frames and tables ... it didn't have keyboard navigation and someone asked a dev to do it. I managed to whip it up in Greasemonkey and it worked cross-frame, so focus in another meant left/right still worked as expected ... but the site dev wouldn't do it because it was "insecure" ... even worse, really, was that if any of the markup changes, either (
2013-04-25 07:29:11	AMcBain	I think) of those scripts will die.
2013-04-25 07:29:30	AMcBain	There's no class names or IDs on the appropriate things. It's "find the 3rd tr on this page, and if it has one or two anchors in it, we found the right place"
2013-04-25 07:29:46	AMcBain	Without tables, that would be so much easier and less fragile.

2013-04-25 07:30:34	AMcBain	and the script to do it is incredibly short.

2013-04-25 10:17:24	AMcBain	Schonert, what I suggest is either a) black out around it so the letter boxing isn't obvious, b) design around the letter boxing so it looks better, c) use some media queries (if possible?) or JavaScript to determine which dimension is smaller. Set that one to 100%.

2013-04-25 11:14:45	alex___	When you float an element to wrap around it some text, something, you want the rest of the content not to write
2013-04-25 11:15:18	alex___	you use clear on the next element you don't want to wrap, and that works
2013-04-25 11:16:03	alex___	but when the element parent is delimited with a background-color or border, it does not consider the floatted element which overflow and that sucks
2013-04-25 11:16:22	alex___	that is why many designer add this at the end of the parent div :
2013-04-25 11:16:23	alex___	<p style="clear:both">&nbsp;</p>

2013-04-25 23:32:36	herbnerder	and the other (admittedly small) is that user zoom is taken into account. so if somebody were to bump the font size up manually your media queries would account for that
2013-04-25 23:32:54	reisio	hrmm?
2013-04-25 23:32:59	herbnerder	but, that's a pretty small benefit

2013-04-25 23:34:06	reisio	yeah?
2013-04-25 23:34:17	herbnerder	if the user bumps up their font size so much that the 3 column media query is no longer true, it will use the tablet based layout

2013-04-30 10:44:30	hawtin	anymore :)
2013-04-30 10:44:46	reisio	doesn’t matter, because Lady_Aleena hasn’t even found something IE8 doesn’t support to use yet
2013-04-30 10:45:15	hawtin	really?
2013-04-30 10:45:25	hawtin	i can't even support my sprites
2013-04-30 10:45:32	hawtin	cause they are doubling every image
2013-04-30 10:45:33	reisio	pardon?
2013-04-30 10:45:35	hawtin	in IE8:))
2013-04-30 10:45:51	reisio	I’m not sure what you just said, but it doesn’t matter, because Lady_Aleena isn’t using sprites
2013-04-30 10:45:55	Lady_Aleena	reisio, I tried "aside", and when I went to style it in the <style> tag, IE8 didn't display "aside" as I wished.
2013-04-30 10:46:19	hawtin	IE8 doesnt do alot of things
2013-04-30 10:46:21	Lady_Aleena	Sprites?
2013-04-30 10:46:24	hawtin	so x_x
2013-04-30 10:46:25	hawtin	yes
2013-04-30 10:46:34	hawtin	put all your images in one
2013-04-30 10:46:40	reisio	Lady_Aleena: that’s unfortunate, but the aside element is just a glorified <p class="aside">

2013-04-30 10:47:07	hawtin	not big images

2013-04-30 10:47:15	reisio	Lady_Aleena: you could also have tried applying CSS to it to make it appear as you wish, as frequently even without supporting an element by default, a browser will style it if you tell it to
2013-04-30 10:47:18	Lady_Aleena	I don't use images on my site.
2013-04-30 10:47:33	reisio	fewer http requests is overrated
2013-04-30 10:47:37	hawtin	lol
2013-04-30 10:47:41	hawtin	overrated my ass
2013-04-30 10:47:59	hawtin	so is having your css in one row ?

2013-04-30 10:48:26	reisio	having your css in one way isn’t overrated, it’s overused (in that it’s used at all)

2013-04-30 10:50:37	hawtin	to make a site only for IE8 and lower

I am currently using Wordpress and i need to add a different image class to a shortcode, currently the theme is the retailer and i want it so that when using the shortcode [banner_simple] the image is gray but goes to color on hover, in functions.php it has the image set to background-image:url('.$bg_image.')" could i define a specific class to just the background image?

2013-05-01 03:44:17	Selvvir	sinistersnare, Always provide a link to a *live* page or pared-down testcase so we can see the problem in action. Looking at code or images alone usually isn't very effective. Also see `paste and `testcase.

2013-05-01 05:26:42	AMcBain	preaction, nope, worse. First, it defaults to IE7 compatibility view rendering. Next, if you want to change that you either have to disable it for all applications or tell it per application executable file name what you want it to be forced to compatibility mode render it as (or the default "latest standards mode" rendering of whatever you have installed)

So you're forced to do it on the fly and run some line of This.That.Foo.GetWhatever().Name to get your current executable file name.

2013-05-01 06:11:20	AMcBain	petey, well if you moved #youtube before #welcome, youtube could be floated right. instead of the "span7" "span5" stuff they both have right now.
2013-05-01 06:11:22	petey	im recreating the website
2013-05-01 06:11:40	petey	im just looking at the way bootstrap grids work and that's what they tell me to do
2013-05-01 06:11:53	AMcBain	because there's something wrong with the current one?
2013-05-01 06:12:04	petey	yes
2013-05-01 06:12:13	AMcBain	Which is?
2013-05-01 06:12:20	petey	its been hijacked old designer is gone and no one knows how to get into the concrete5 installation

2013-05-01 06:13:24	TheCowboy	petey, one thing you can try is putting the middle in a box of 940px with overflow hidden, and taking off the -20px margin and see if that does it

2013-05-01 06:14:28	TheCowboy	but usually it's better(when using bootstrap) to just size your graphics within the widths bootstrap sets than toying with it
2013-05-01 06:14:39	petey	amcbain because we just want to get it up and running as fast as possible and everyone likes the current layout

2013-05-01 06:16:14	petey	i guess ill just start with restructuring everything and i guess i will resize the background images to fit
2013-05-01 06:16:38	TheCowboy	i'd resize the header and footer images to the width of the containers

2013-05-01 07:26:42	iaj	i got 2 questions.. would you solve something like this http://is.gd/jRqNRw, eg the whole conatiner here. with images or pure css?
2013-05-01 07:26:59	iaj	and the second thing, is... checkbox styling is rather tricky in css right?
2013-05-01 07:27:54	AMcBain	You can get the cut corners with CSS, if you don't mind cheating and fooling the user.
2013-05-01 07:28:21	gavilan2	iaj: you can do everything with css3...
2013-05-01 07:28:23	iaj	AMcBain: would you advice on doing so?
2013-05-01 07:28:30	iaj	or rather stick to css?
2013-05-01 07:28:34	iaj	arg.. images. sorry
2013-05-01 07:28:35	gavilan2	but if you want a lot of browser compatibility, it's probably a bad idea
2013-05-01 07:28:45	gavilan2	olders browsers don't work well with that stuff...
2013-05-01 07:28:49	AMcBain	gavilan2, CSS triangles worked before CSS3.
2013-05-01 07:29:14	gavilan2	AMcBain: which css version then?
2013-05-01 07:29:14	AMcBain	iaj, all depends on you, really. The corners could be covered by up pseudo-elements styled as CSS triangles.
2013-05-01 07:29:23	RingtailedFox	heya, guys... i have some css questions... i have one css file that contains these following lines: @font-face { font-family: "Square 721 BT"; src: url("Square721BT.TTF"); } body {background: #000000; color: #FFD700; font-family: "Square 721 BT";} h1 {background: #000000; color: #FFD700; font-family: "Square 721 BT";} p {background: #000000; color: #FFD700; font-family: "Square 721 BT";}...  but i would like to incorporate them into

2013-05-01 07:29:40	gavilan2	nice...

2013-05-01 07:30:09	AMcBain	iaj, checkboxes are also similarly a trick, you can't really style them for reasons of being "replaced content" elements. However, you can cover them up.
2013-05-01 07:30:14	AMcBain	with whatever you want.
2013-05-01 07:30:30	gavilan2	AMcBain: You can also implement your own checkbox
2013-05-01 07:30:54	AMcBain	True, but if you intend to submit it as an actual form, then having real elements might be nice.

2013-05-01 07:32:21	gavilan2	iaj: images are good!
2013-05-01 07:32:25	AMcBain	This is an example I have of styling radio buttons: http://temp.asmcbain.net/htmlcss/form-2/form-2.html
2013-05-01 07:32:35	AMcBain	Same could be done for checkboxes.

2013-05-01 07:33:19	AMcBain	iaj, so do it as part of the background and break the background up into multiple pieces.

2013-05-01 07:33:39	AMcBain	CSS3 added support for multiple background images. If you need support back further than that (such as in IE), then use pseudo-elements for the end caps.
2013-05-01 07:33:42	AMcBain	That will get you down to IE8.

2013-05-01 07:34:00	iaj	So I'm using multiple backgrounds for the surrounding div.
2013-05-01 07:34:17	AMcBain	The link I gave you for the radio buttons (also applicable to the checkboxes) should work down to IE8.

2013-05-01 07:45:47	AMcBain	You can't just grab a font off your own system and host it, as it is most likely one you need to buy from the foundary to use, and not licensed for the web in any case.

2013-05-01 07:51:56	paulvd	why is fond rendering (google fonts) so poor in some browsers or websites
2013-05-01 07:51:59	AMcBain	Well, not quite. The problem is fonts can be downloaded from your server by people or applications other than the browser. There's not really any good way to protect from that. So the net effect is that someone could get it for free.

2013-05-01 08:14:55	AMcBain	airco, well ... I'd figure out why the relative path fails first.
2013-05-01 08:15:02	AMcBain	It's definitely more preferable than using a full path.
2013-05-01 08:15:08	AMcBain	Less work if things change.
2013-05-01 08:15:43	AMcBain	It seems to work just fine as "button0.png" for the path, so I would use that. Perhaps the first time around you had the wrong file name.
2013-05-01 08:16:55	Lady_Aleena	I would just use plain text "buttons". ">" for play, "||" for pause, "<<" for rewind, ">>" for fast forward, and "0" for stop or something. Then again, I decided to go completely image free for my site.

I need the submenu to have a 100% width while the parent menu maintain a specific menu.. the submenu is a row which pops up on top of the menu (if that makes sense). Is this possible with css, since the sub list will always inherit the width of the parent when using % right?

2013-05-01 22:21:23	lakcaj	reisio, I posted this yesterday and the only solution was to add a margin-top to the right column.  I would like the text in both columns, regardless of font size, to be aligned at the top, but maintain the line-height: 1.4 for aesthetics.  The problem with applying a margin is it will vary depending on the difference in font sizes.  I was wondering if you maybe had a better solution?  Here's a link: http://jsfiddle.ne

I'm guessing it's because one of the parents doesn't have it's position set but I haven't been able to identify which one. Yes, the html is pretty shitty and has errors. Not my fault and I don't have full time to fix it for him yet… so please, any help without sarcasm would be much appreciated.

2013-05-02 05:06:22	AMcBain	FreezingCold, but my comment wasn't on whether or not you could get CSS table styles to do what you want, but that if you wanted them to be equal width, the list + regular non-table CSS styles would have been a better end goal.

2013-05-02 05:19:43	AMcBain	If it's not, then left or right align it and fill the extra space with something useful.

2013-05-02 06:52:00	mezzie911	and i think it's because while it's all the left it can go the wrapper is too narrow
2013-05-02 06:52:18	cheshirecatspazz	are you using float or align?

2013-05-02 07:44:48	AMcBain	paul_, nope! CSS3 builds upon the previous CSS specifications, so nothing special. However, given that, it also follows the same rules in that imcomplete, non-standard, or wrong/improper implementations of features should be prefixed.
2013-05-02 07:45:19	AMcBain	As it stands, I believe WebKit and Opera require prefixes.

2013-05-02 07:47:41	paul_	well i had my "a" element set to "width : 200px" , and under "a:hover", i forgot to set a "width 220px" for the "transition: width 2s;" to actually function on
2013-05-02 07:47:56	AMcBain	AH.
2013-05-02 07:47:57	AMcBain	Ah*
2013-05-02 07:48:26	paul_	there's no way to affect other elements (using just css) with "uniqueId:hover", right?
2013-05-02 07:48:31	AMcBain	I should also note, not saying that you did, that the transition declaration generally needs to be on the base state in order to work in both directions.
2013-05-02 07:48:59	AMcBain	So if you put transition: ...; inside a :hover, it may only work when you hover the element, but snap back when you move the mouse off.
2013-05-02 07:49:17	AMcBain	paul_, nope, you totally can, as long as they're selectable from that element.
2013-05-02 07:49:41	paul_	but how could i select an element outside of it? I was thinking of selecting the siblings
2013-05-02 07:49:42	AMcBain	#element1 ~ div -> all divs that are siblings and past #element1 on the DOM.
2013-05-02 07:49:56	AMcBain	#element1 + blah -> any blah immediately following a #element1.
2013-05-02 07:50:00	AMcBain	Just add :hover, :active, whatever.

2013-05-02 21:16:35	scar	Just  curious on people's opinion
2013-05-02 21:16:58	acr0	scar, I do use them
2013-05-02 21:17:05	acr0	FernandoBasso, http://css-tricks.com/examples/hrs/
2013-05-02 21:17:48	FernandoBasso	acr0: I came across that one too. Very nice indeed.
2013-05-02 21:17:55	acr0	FernandoBasso, if you still end up having trouble with <hr /> you could just use a div with a 1px height
2013-05-02 21:18:01	acr0	maybe not the best semantic solution, but it works :)
2013-05-02 21:18:24	FernandoBasso	Sure.

2013-05-03 00:17:12	nemo	RabSimpson: and we own what we do with ourselves
2013-05-03 00:17:27	RabSimpson	nemo: we're made up of stuff which was here billions of years prior and will remain for billions after we're gone, we don't own that
2013-05-03 00:17:29	RingtailedFox	besides, that does not answer my question of "do i become debt-free if i give all my money to seomeone else?"

2013-05-03 00:18:37	RabSimpson	look, if you guys don't get it that's not my responsibility. go learn how fiat banking works and you'll find out what you do and don't own.

2013-05-03 04:08:46	paul_	is there a way to have a parent (such as a navbar), be somewhat opaque (opacity:0.8;) for eg, but have the child be at 1.0 opacity?

2013-05-03 04:10:45	AMcBain	paul_, use rgba or hsla as a background color instead of the opacity property.
2013-05-03 04:11:09	paul_	but wouldn't that take away the effect of opacity??
2013-05-03 04:12:10	AMcBain	The 'a' in rgb*a* is alpha. transparency. opacity. whatever you want to call it.

2013-05-03 04:13:35	AMcBain	With the opacity property, nothing can be more opaque than 1. Since such is the case, children cannot be more opaque than their parent. Thus you cannot have a child appear opaque if a parent has an opacity < 1. Just so you know.

2013-05-03 06:55:18	AMcBain	Probably a z-index issue.
2013-05-03 06:55:35	Heist	How do I use z-index to push those images back
2013-05-03 06:55:46	Heist	so that they don't kill my drop downs :(
2013-05-03 06:56:02	AMcBain	It would probably be easier to make the container of the menus have a higher z-index than the content (or the default assigned to the content) than to fix all the possible content.
2013-05-03 06:56:32	Heist	The higher the Z-index the farther back they go?
2013-05-03 06:56:41	MrGate	Heist it looks super simple
2013-05-03 06:56:54	Heist	It's very elementary. Just a simple database
2013-05-03 06:56:54	MrGate	remove the underline on log in
2013-05-03 06:56:55	AMcBain	Heist, no.
2013-05-03 06:57:01	AMcBain	Heist, higher z-index = closer to the top.
2013-05-03 06:57:12	AMcBain	Generally.
2013-05-03 06:57:24	AMcBain	There is some stuff with parents that have a z-index and stacking rules, etc. but overall that's kinda it.
2013-05-03 06:57:28	Heist	So go into the css, and change the menu to a higher Z than the content in the menu?
2013-05-03 06:57:52	MrGate	just the container your using for the navigation
2013-05-03 06:57:55	AMcBain	Why would that help? Isn't the overlapping content from the main content area of the layout?
2013-05-03 06:58:02	MrGate	then anything in it should have the same z-index
2013-05-03 06:58:21	MrGate	but i recommend removing the underline on login
2013-05-03 06:58:32	MrGate	it looks like a 2 year old did that

2013-05-03 13:34:57	xec	and it sort of looks like you're on a wild goose chase. i'm not sure what style.php is, maybe a generated file over what's in the /styles folder? google gave me this http://area51.phpbb.com/docs/30x/coding-guidelines.html
2013-05-03 13:36:03	xec	Pangaea: the statement you started out with would indeed change from a solid color to an image. but the overriding rule is in style.php so you need to figure out what that is

2013-05-03 22:12:22	kopoba	samholmes but i dont see the proble there is 2 background  as he want
2013-05-03 22:12:32	samholmes	1. load this page http://jsbin.com/oritan/1 2. resize window width below 800px 3. scroll to the right. What I want to happen: header moves the the left when scrolling to the right. What happens: the header stays fixed and you cannot see the right side of the header when scrolling to the right.

2013-05-04 06:27:40	RNT	that`s good news :)
2013-05-04 06:27:47	AMcBain	Blink = fork of WebKit = same WebKit problems at the outset :P

2013-05-04 06:28:15	vaerros	yeah
2013-05-04 06:28:36	AMcBain	I fully expect them to introduce more WTFs while refactoring it like the promised.
2013-05-04 06:28:58	AMcBain	The good news is that because of the refactoring promise, they won't be able to send pull requests to WebKit, so the WTFness stays local.
2013-05-04 06:29:21	AMcBain	The incompatibility should at least be good for that.
2013-05-04 06:30:05	AMcBain	but I do have to give props to WebKit itself, it appears you can animate -webkit-transform now in more cases than I believe you used to be able to, if not anything. It works rather well.

2013-05-04 06:31:33	AMcBain	It has a backface issue too, but that can be fixed by turning them off if they shouldn't show up anyway./

2013-05-04 06:34:18	AMcBain	Some of which may or may not have been fixed, I recall letting them know about them. One was that outlines were resistant to opacity changes.
2013-05-04 06:34:36	AMcBain	I had some thing where I would fade them to 0 or whatever, and all would disappear but the outlines.
2013-05-04 06:35:09	RNT	i have another question too, i noticed many ppl using -moz-border-radius 2px; -webkit-border-radius:2px; border-radius:2px;
2013-05-04 06:35:15	RNT	what is the point?
2013-05-04 06:35:41	AMcBain	To not have one. It rounds the corners. :)
2013-05-04 06:35:47	RNT	because what i tested, i don't realy need to add 3 times the same shit, the result is the same anyway
2013-05-04 06:36:09	AMcBain	Ah, yes, all major browsers have unprefixed it.
2013-05-04 06:36:24	AMcBain	If you need to target Firefox 3.6.x, that's the last time you need -moz-
2013-05-04 06:36:33	RNT	i see
2013-05-04 06:36:44	RNT	so, i don't need to worry about it
2013-05-04 06:36:49	AMcBain	Nope.
2013-05-04 06:37:57	RNT	me, i think is your bussines to update your browser, not mine to make the web page compatible with your old browser
2013-05-04 06:38:01	jamesdotnet	RNT: I think you should change the background color to #C0FFEE
2013-05-04 06:38:01	RNT	i'm right?
2013-05-04 06:38:21	RNT	page background?
2013-05-04 06:38:32	RNT	or for that element?

2013-05-04 06:38:51	AMcBain	You should make sure that for a reasonable number of versions back the site is navigable.
2013-05-04 06:39:00	AMcBain	That means that you can at least view and read content, even if it's not the prettiest.
2013-05-04 06:39:25	AMcBain	It's not really such a big deal for other browsers, but IE. and there I think "2 back" is now IE8. So that's not so bad either.

2013-05-04 06:40:29	jamesdotnet	IE8 is the new IE6

2013-05-04 09:29:18	santori	i copy that markup into the child style.css

2013-05-04 12:13:59	linduxed	hey guys! i want to make a fixed header like the one found on http://www.gog.com/. i don't have a problem with the fixed part, i'm mostly concerned with how they do the centered menus
2013-05-04 12:15:05	linduxed	looking at the page in firebug, the header is called mainNav, and contains a right (empty) div, the menu div and a left (empty) div
2013-05-04 12:15:19	ravenzz	that's quite silly
2013-05-04 12:15:28	oksushi	they do it in a pretty shitty way, requiring two empty divs to 'fill out' the left and right sides
2013-05-04 12:15:45	linduxed	that's possible, i'm not so sharp on this stuff myself

2013-05-04 12:16:28	linduxed	just to have a nice fixed header, which limits its content to the width of the rest of the page
2013-05-04 12:16:32	ravenzz	and a load of padding negative left values
2013-05-04 12:16:47	ravenzz	linduxed you should paste your markup somewhere

2013-05-04 12:40:33	airwalker	Hi I have a trivial problem but my understanding of CSS is not fantastic.  http://jsfiddle.net/a8peT/  I am constructing a table, wrapping text causes other cells in the row to move down.  Firstly is using divs a correct way to construct the table? What about the inline block? Removing the spacing between inline block siblings using negative word-spacing.  Comments / advice appreciated please. :-)

2013-05-05 02:44:58	jamesdotnet	I was thinking more along the lines... To avoid duplicate content issues with example.com/home and example.com/HOME, you might decide to redirect all requests to lowercase, and then your example.com/camelCase.css URL would break if the server is case sensitive.

2013-05-05 03:23:38	bluesm	AMcBain: Ok. I got that. I should be relative to the width and height of font. So it is reasonable to set height with "ex" and width with "em"

2013-05-05 03:24:24	AMcBain	bluesm, depends on what you're doing. Sometimes you really do want a 300px wide box and text inside it should just wrap.

2013-05-05 03:25:43	AMcBain	If you want it proportional to the element itself, perhaps use the units of the height and width. If you always want it to be a fixed "roundedness" use pixels
2013-05-05 03:26:18	AMcBain	There's a lot of stuff on the web that's really dependent on what you want and what you're doing. Just like anything else, there's no silver bullet.

2013-05-05 06:02:34	AMcBain	boytoy_, if that's your reason for minifying, that's stupid. People can and will "pretify" it, and trace it out.
2013-05-05 06:03:01	boytoy_	AMcBain: it's one of many reasons
2013-05-05 06:03:04	AMcBain	Most minify to save on bandwidth / download costs and times.
2013-05-05 06:03:05	boytoy_	don't hate
2013-05-05 06:03:08	herbnerder	no it isn't
2013-05-05 06:03:56	AMcBain	boytoy_, if it's one of your reasons, it's stupid :) lets say you don't put a license, or claim the copyright on it, and you're from some place that doesn't recognize implicit copyright (or perhaps even if you are) on it. Someone comes along, unminifies it, understands it, and steals it. Now what?
2013-05-05 06:04:15	AMcBain	They could claim you didn't exert ownership over it and provided no means to protect it.
2013-05-05 06:04:31	boytoy_	hehe
2013-05-05 06:04:37	boytoy_	i expect that to happen
2013-05-05 06:04:38	AMcBain	Minifying something is like a speed bump. You might consider slowing down, but it won't stop you.
2013-05-05 06:04:58	boytoy_	but either way, even if they copy my js, my design will still remain superior
2013-05-05 06:05:13	AMcBain	It will? I think I remember the sort of stuff you create.
2013-05-05 06:05:14	boytoy_	copy that, and i have a reason to fuck you up in court
2013-05-05 06:05:23	lewix	so basically when its compiled you can't read the css even with firebugs?
2013-05-05 06:05:35	oksushi	lewix: no, you can 'read' any CSS easily
2013-05-05 06:05:37	AMcBain	lewix, no, Firebug is perfectly capable :)

2013-05-05 06:06:09	AMcBain	lewix, minified or generated CSS is only a potential parsing problem to humans. If the browser can understand it, then the browser developer tools can make it nicer for you to read.
2013-05-05 06:06:10	oksushi	…
2013-05-05 06:06:15	boytoy_	and we will pay you a "personal visit"
2013-05-05 06:06:20	AMcBain	boytoy_, you sound like an idiot.
2013-05-05 06:06:29	oksushi	boytoy_: your first mistake was thinking that anyone wants to copy your work
2013-05-05 06:06:29	lewix	ok thank you
2013-05-05 06:06:30	AMcBain	s/sound like/are/
2013-05-05 06:07:14	AMcBain	lewix, unless you've got really huge stylesheets (which is a bad thing in and of itself, probably) or a lot of them, there's no real need/point to minifying them.
2013-05-05 06:07:36	AMcBain	The generated ones are just from tools that some people find easier to work with to compose styles, such as SASS, LESS, Stylus, etc.
2013-05-05 06:08:05	lewix	ok
2013-05-05 06:08:22	boytoy_	oksushi: hehe
2013-05-05 06:08:26	boytoy_	wishful thinking i guess
2013-05-05 06:08:26	AMcBain	In the too-many-sheets scenario, if you concatenated them in the right order minified, a client would have to download one file and smaller.

2013-05-05 06:19:58	AMcBain	Why always put the shadow on the *outside* of the box? :)
2013-05-05 06:20:10	preaction	the code is already protected by copyright. it is illegal to copy/paste any part of it to your own work if you do not have a license. how hard is this to understand?
2013-05-05 06:21:01	AMcBain	preaction, not all countries have the same rules as the US. The US grants an implicit copyright to works you have created in lieu of other agreements (such as ownership of work done for companies, etc.), but I don't think everyone else.
2013-05-05 06:21:09	AMcBain	else? I meant does.
2013-05-05 06:21:24	preaction	if they're a signatory to the Berne convention on copyright, then yes they do
2013-05-05 06:21:40	AMcBain	It is still better in any case to explicitly claim it with a statment somewhere in the code or on the site.
2013-05-05 06:21:42	Havvy	Which is a faster selector?  .rare.common or .common.rare ?
2013-05-05 06:21:45	boytoy_	yeah
2013-05-05 06:21:54	preaction	Havvy, probably neither
2013-05-05 06:22:05	boytoy_	90% of the sites on the www belong to countries that adhere to the berne convention so
2013-05-05 06:22:53	boytoy_	i dont recall who made that estimate but
2013-05-05 06:22:58	boytoy_	some dude at mit
2013-05-05 06:23:02	AMcBain	Havvy, both are the same type of selector so I agree with preaction. The occurance ratio of them shouldn't affect speed of matching.
2013-05-05 06:24:02	preaction	don't even get me started on the "no-license" """"movement""""
2013-05-05 06:24:10	preaction	does four air-quotes make it more sarcastic?
2013-05-05 06:24:20	AMcBain	No, it makes it wiki markup ;)

2013-05-05 06:25:39	Havvy	AMcBain: I would think the occurrence ratio  could affect the speed of matching for false negatives.

2013-05-05 06:27:01	AMcBain	Havvy, unless they've got some "special cases" built in to the processor, it's still evaulated the same as any other selector. Reality is that it's going to vary by rendering engine and only empirical testing can tell you what you want to know.
2013-05-05 06:27:32	AMcBain	Shorter of it: CSS is a spec. How it's implemented, as long as it conforms, is not defined.

2013-05-05 06:29:54	AMcBain	I remember for work having to e-mail someone because there was no license listing for some code this guy did that for, probably not intentionally, so that we wouldn't have a chance of getting in trouble.
2013-05-05 06:30:26	boytoy_	Havvy: bsd doesnt hold that well either
2013-05-05 06:30:36	preaction	but without copyright, you truly could simply take everything that anyone ever did and copy it all you wanted and no artistic endeavor would ever make a dime and we'd be back to government patronage

2013-05-05 06:31:44	AMcBain	preaction, I believe one of the CC licenses might have made it to court, but I don't remember which, as they've got localized versions, and X variants ...
2013-05-05 06:32:14	boytoy_	preaction: yeah all cases have always been "third party"

2013-05-05 06:56:43	AMcBain	Yay! A CSS question.
2013-05-05 06:57:20	alphanumb	AMcBain, are you bored?
2013-05-05 06:57:44	AMcBain	alphanumb, no, but I think our previous conversation beat the dead horse to bloody bits.
2013-05-05 06:58:00	AMcBain	alphanumb, also, inline styles are bad.
2013-05-05 06:58:17	alphanumb	haha, I don't remember our previous conversation. and I know they're bad, but -.-
2013-05-05 06:58:52	alphanumb	AMcBain, solution?
2013-05-05 06:59:00	alphanumb	tried float, display:inline
2013-05-05 06:59:02	AMcBain	but what?
2013-05-05 06:59:08	AMcBain	If you know they're bad, why do you keep doing it? :)
2013-05-05 07:00:02	alphanumb	it's going in my sidebar as an ad manager, theres only a little code, so it's fine by me. in fact, if you help me solve this, i'll seperate style/content, hows that?
2013-05-05 07:01:41	alphanumb	so how do I get 125x400's side by side then <br /> followed by the 125x125's side by side?
2013-05-05 07:01:46	AMcBain	That's an empty promise. As soon as it is solved, there's no way for me to verify, and nor I would I care to chase after it. This is more for good practices.
2013-05-05 07:01:52	AMcBain	So you get in the habit of doing it right.
2013-05-05 07:01:57	AMcBain	and no, <br> is never a good idea.
2013-05-05 07:02:02	AMcBain	Unless you're writing poems.

2013-05-05 07:28:42	preaction	Havvy, XSLT is more of a template language. your data is XML. your XSLT can then render your XML as HTML. XML Stylesheet Language Transforms I think is what the acronym means

2013-05-05 07:29:24	AMcBain	The other bit is that I believe with HTML5 embedding SVG and MathML (both more XML oriented) is legal now.
2013-05-05 07:29:32	preaction	well, REST you can still have, but the content negotiation part is optional. you always get XML
2013-05-05 07:29:36	AMcBain	Even if you declared the document as text/html.
2013-05-05 07:29:42	preaction	yeah, that's kinda weird
2013-05-05 07:29:54	preaction	and why invent a new damned standard for that when XML covered it

And it's perfectly fine for the iPad, but when I navigate to a SINGLE post, like http://luzlol.me/bittorrent-sync/ it crashes =(((

2013-05-05 10:29:58	darkmutt	leonvv box-sizing : border-box will make your normal box layout in css work much more logically to be honest only the margin is outside the size
2013-05-05 10:31:06	leonvv	darkmutt: Yeah I just looked it up online, I'm very glad I found it because setting padding to elements to a 100% width is dramatic
2013-05-05 10:31:10	darkmutt	and security updates should be ESPECIALLY important for corporate environments even in browsers and especially in those connected to www
2013-05-05 10:31:57	darkmutt	leonvv i base all my websites on box-sizing:border-box cause it lets me set elements without thinking much about other elements with them and worrying if i set one new one itll screw up my entire lyout

2013-05-05 10:39:09	darkmutt	in my opinion the default box sizing has been built by a completely not logical person, reason? when you say an elements width is 100px and height is 100px then no matter WHAT else you set in that element the size SHOULD STAY 100X100px

2013-05-05 10:40:45	GoSox	ravenzz: i use display: table to make variable width page layouts, so i run into box-sizing issues more often than people who  make fixed with pages
2013-05-05 10:40:47	darkmutt	ravenzz but logic should be the MAIN thing in anything dealing with computers and the default is not logical i would go all for margin sizing if i had that possibility to be honest which i sadly don't
2013-05-05 10:40:48	herbnerder	indeed. I only use it on specific elements, usually when I want some pixel based border on a fluid box.

2013-05-05 10:54:17	GoSox	Mac OS actually saves screen shots as PNGs

2013-05-05 14:11:34	darkmutt	what's w.r.t.?? though most likely it is
2013-05-05 14:11:50	AMcBain	With respect to.
2013-05-05 14:12:18	darkmutt	uhum thanks :) Guddu the easiest answer would most likely be making table out of that form or part of it
2013-05-05 14:12:36	Guddu	darkmutt, AMcBain With respect to each other
2013-05-05 14:12:42	darkmutt	but i guess you could for example float inputs to right and text to left
2013-05-05 14:13:06	Guddu	darkmutt, Thanks...actually i was using a table until now but I have been told not to use tables for form layouts. Its not a good practise

2013-05-05 14:13:12	AMcBain	Guddu, easiest thing is to make the labels inline-block, give them all the same fixed width that's at least as large as the largest label, then using text-align.
2013-05-05 14:13:54	darkmutt	that should work too or floating them xD
2013-05-05 14:13:55	Guddu	darkmutt, I want the lable and fields to be horizontallly in centre of containing DIV and labels and input fields with same margin so tht it looks neat. So far I have only been able to achieve centre aligned....
2013-05-05 14:14:21	darkmutt	then do as AMcBain suggested that should work
2013-05-05 14:14:36	AMcBain	Floating them wouldn't do that. Would end up same as before.
2013-05-05 14:14:41	AMcBain	Except with floated elements.
2013-05-05 14:14:45	Guddu	AMcBain, IS there a way to say that the label should have only half the width of the containing DIV?

2013-05-05 14:15:18	darkmutt	not nesessarily if he made the input elements of a fixed width Guddu ugh i hate that nece blahblah word i ALWAYS get it wrong XD
2013-05-05 14:15:45	AMcBain	Guddu, sure, you could make them width: 50%; if they were inline-block, but that won't line them up like you think it will.
2013-05-05 14:16:24	AMcBain	Which is interesting ... because it shouldn't be doing what I'm seeing with your fiddle doing that.
2013-05-05 14:16:36	Guddu	AMcBain, Width of each should be 50% of containing DIV and within that Width I Can say left aligned ?
2013-05-05 14:16:51	Guddu	I am confused
2013-05-05 14:17:36	AMcBain	http://jsfiddle.net/4YAGz/9/
2013-05-05 14:17:41	AMcBain	I added my styles to the end.
2013-05-05 14:18:16	AMcBain	but you don't need to do it that way ... you could remove the block that left aligns (just before the label block) and set the label width to 125px. Would have about the same effect.
2013-05-05 14:18:35	AMcBain	darkmutt, did you figure out your reverse curves problem>
2013-05-05 14:18:41	AMcBain	s/>/?/
2013-05-05 14:19:06	Guddu	Thanks AMcBain This is what i was struggling with for a long time now :)
2013-05-05 14:19:45	darkmutt	actually with the suggestion of using :after and :before i did i didn't even think of those before cause i didn't even remember they existed for how rarely i use them xD
2013-05-05 14:21:48	AMcBain	Yes, but that's an empty response. It doesn't tell me if you actually figured out how to achieve what you wanted or not.

2013-05-05 14:23:16	Guddu	AMcBain, Yes. Now I am reading the changes u made and experimenting with them to understand this better.
2013-05-05 14:23:40	AMcBain	Well, that statement was aimed at darkmutt, but whatever.
2013-05-05 14:24:58	darkmutt	now it'll be easy to achieve or kinda cause i will have to make the border go around the after element and make it overlay the rest of it so should be simple enough, i was just wondering if it's possible before wasn't really interested in doing it yet at that point
2013-05-05 14:26:27	AMcBain	The way I thought about it, the trick is really doing that on the button element, not the box it appears to be.
2013-05-05 14:27:16	darkmutt	yep either would have worked i think
2013-05-05 14:27:50	AMcBain	In theory, but it gets more complicated doing it on the box it appears to be. As you only have two pseudo-elements, and 3 corners.
2013-05-05 14:28:02	AMcBain	So one corner has to be that of the button's parent.

2013-05-05 14:28:32	AMcBain	If you do it on the button, the button can be wrapped (as mentioned, some sort of parent) allowing you to use the parent's top left corner + the two pseudo-elements.
2013-05-05 14:29:00	AMcBain	Which also has the benefit that if you don't supply such a button/div wrapper thing, the original box looks normal.

2013-05-05 18:54:44	rockhardrooster	So... my short CSS code at http://pastebin.com/M43xSX0c doesn't behave like I except it to. I want to style a:link and a:visited, but I want it differently styled for the link of the page you're already on. But even though I think it has higher specificity, it doesn't override the first styling. What am I doing wrong?
2013-05-05 18:55:35	darkmutt	you can put in an !important to each property in that specifity, should overwrite everything rockhardrooster ]

2013-05-05 19:25:40	alphanum	i'm completely lost. i tried getting help yesterday about the same problem, but it's beyond my skill set--though all i need is guidence to fix it myself. the problem lies in one of my stubborn yet very beefy navigation lists on the navigation bar near the upper part of my site. the column is very long. the idea is to have every 10 <li>'s wrap back up to the top, aligning every new div's margin-top
2013-05-05 19:25:40	alphanum	with baseline so that it will look fluid and straight. I absolutely tried wrapping it many ways, but didn't know how to start. at first, I thought it was best doing it server side but upon looking in header.php, it looks like a single function is used to output the nav bar; i have therefore come to the conclusion that I should use a css-only solution. I know there is a cross browser solution for
2013-05-05 19:25:40	alphanum	this problem, and I need your help. pm or post here for live link & thanks for looking.

If into the CSS, how?

2013-05-06 01:40:26	AMcBain	The latter can be done with position: fixed;. It will stay static relative to the viewport. The former requires the idea of a "full height" layout.

2013-05-06 01:49:31	AMcBain	I have a small HTML5-based app for being a mini data-displaying app and stream player for a website. If I minify the entire thing, CSS and JS, it comes out to about or less than jquery, minified.

2013-05-06 01:58:17	AMcBain	Right, and to TheEternalAbyss's note, if you can do it cleanly in HTML/CSS by itself, do it. Don't involve JavaScript unless yo uhave to.

2013-05-06 02:03:52	TheEternalAbyss	though using z-index does remove those block elements from their natural flow

2013-05-06 02:04:37	reisio	AMcBain: to draw looks, I'm guessing
2013-05-06 02:04:47	Ultraviolence	so if you set something to z-index: 1; that makes it the header? or index: 1; for that div

2013-05-06 14:49:03	BorjaGVO	Hi all. I'm trying to follow an example (http://www.onextrapixel.com/2011/06/03/how-to-create-a-horizontal-dropdown-menu-with-html-css-and-jquery/) for creating menus. However, when I try it on IE9 it doesn't work as expected. I read some of the issues people had but not sure how to fix it. This is what I exactly have in source: HTML: http://pastebin.com/LRVV2SSP ; CSS:http://pastebin.com/db6WpHKX. I appreciate any help :-) Thanks!

2013-05-06 23:11:16	alphanum	ok

2013-05-06 23:11:43	JohnnyCache	the "!important" overrides

2013-05-06 23:49:53	JohnnyCache	any idea to change label css when i choose radio button?
2013-05-06 23:50:25	-->	sjeijk_ (~SJ@s529d26aa.adsl.online.nl) has joined #css
2013-05-06 23:50:35	JohnnyCache	like bolding <label for="option1"> <input type=radio id="option1" value="1"> text here </label>
2013-05-06 23:51:05	JohnnyCache	let's say i have 3 options, i want to bold the inner text of <label> when it's selected
2013-05-06 23:52:00	kamoricks	JohnnyCache: You want to nest the tags like: <input id="option1"> <label for="option1"> so that the input isn't part of its own label (css-wise). Then, you can use a selector like: input[type="radio"]:checked + label { font-weight: bold; }

2013-05-07 01:53:46	preaction_	also, your color scheme is a bit hard to focus on
2013-05-07 01:53:48	zapsoda	Also any design tips would be great, Im thinking a psycadellic background with a less transparent white container background

2013-05-07 01:55:41	preaction_	something that isn't bright
2013-05-07 01:55:49	preaction_	contrast is good
2013-05-07 01:56:16	preaction_	now what do you mean by "inline"? that word has a specific meaning in CSS that doesn't seem to apply here
2013-05-07 01:56:29	preaction_	like, do you want the text to flow around the image?

2013-05-07 04:46:34	Lobosque	I have a question about responsive css: how do I proportionally reduce an image size below a certain width? for example, after 800px width, the image will always have full size (lets say 400px). below 800px, it will reduce proportionally (so, for example, at 400px width, the image would be 200px wide)

Symptoms it's broke: when you hover a button on the backside appears in the upper right, and if you click the button in the upper left, it flips across itself instead of around, like you'd expect with perspective. Then shows the reverse (mirror) of the front side. It's not hiding the backfaces, even though it says "-webkit-backface-visibility: hidden".

2013-05-07 15:36:09	TankaTonka	Weird issues with media-queries right now, Sometimes the incorrect media-query is applied. But as soon as you do something to the browser window (open a file menu, resizing or something like that) the correct media-query is applied. Any idea what's up?
2013-05-07 15:36:39	TankaTonka	I'm creating a popup div and have some media queries based on min-height, which simply adjust the height of the popup
2013-05-07 15:36:59	TankaTonka	the queries are ordered from lowest to highest

2013-05-07 15:38:08	TankaTonka	Usually the problem only occurs the first time the popup is created. The media-query with lowest height is opened, even if you have a browser window of ~1000 px height. As soon as you change something in the browser, it "gets it" and applies another query
2013-05-07 15:38:13	TankaTonka	Same problem in both IE and Chrome

You need to have a username registered with nickserv, and currently be identified with it. 2) Just because we also do help for a web-related technology doesn't mean that it's right to assume that as such there might be PHP developers in here and you should come in and ask your question because the first channel wasn't able to help you.

2013-05-08 07:11:56	AMcBain	Well, as I noted earlier before even seeing it, you forgot some stuff.
2013-05-08 07:12:24	AMcBain	In order for overflow: hidden to have any effect, it can't be a float itself. You forgot the overflow: hidden; and the float: none;
2013-05-08 07:12:27	AMcBain	for #search.

2013-05-08 07:12:48	AMcBain	However, the selectors for the previous li are overly specific, so your existing simple selector #search isn't enough to "win".

2013-05-08 07:12:55	BaDaSs	still nothing

2013-05-08 07:13:47	AMcBain	The selectors that provide the float: left; win over the one that tells it none.
2013-05-08 07:14:04	AMcBain	"div#top-right-middle ul#nav > li" This is a selector for the non-#search li. You don't need all that.
2013-05-08 07:14:19	AMcBain	"#nav > li" would have suited.

2013-05-08 07:18:27	AMcBain	Well, some of the things that will get you close on the input are this: remove the height declaration. Add width: 100%; remove the margin-left, and add -moz-box-sizing: border-box; box-sizing: border-box;
2013-05-08 07:18:52	AMcBain	The box sizing stuff should go in the order listed in the stylesheet. So when Firefox finally unprefixes box-sizing, the spec and conforming impl will win.
2013-05-08 07:19:00	AMcBain	s/win/get used/
2013-05-08 07:19:34	AMcBain	border-box for box-sizing means that the width should be the width of the element, not the width of the element's content area.
2013-05-08 07:19:55	AMcBain	The latter means that if you add padding, the element gets larger. Anyone who ships packages a lot, knows this is a load of crock.

2013-05-09 02:25:28	Selvvir	sunbeam, a (pared-down) testcase is a page that isolates the problem with the minimum required markup, styling and scripting. See `paste for services that easily let you create such testcases for others to see.

2013-05-09 07:21:22	AMcBain	It does indeed.
2013-05-09 07:21:34	AMcBain	In the default box model, width is that of the content area of a box.
2013-05-09 07:21:43	AMcBain	So padding and borders make it larger.
2013-05-09 07:22:03	robonerd	yea i didn't like that style as much
2013-05-09 07:22:07	robonerd	which style do you prefer AMcBain ?
2013-05-09 07:22:09	AMcBain	With border-box box model, the width is of the entire box. Borders and padding. The content area gets smaller when you add padding or borders.
2013-05-09 07:23:01	AMcBain	I use what makes sense. Most times I stick with the default because I don't have to do anything and I'm okay at making it do what I want. If something I want to do doesn't work quite right with it, but easily does so with border-box, then I apply it.

2013-05-09 07:25:05	schnoodles-osx	Howdy all. I have a client predicament :\. I am creating a responsive website which is the usual but the client wants a 'wrapping image' so image to the left and the right of the layout which is position: fixed && height:100%. I am not sure the best way to do this or if its even possible.
2013-05-09 07:27:27	AMcBain	Do you happen to have an example of what you want (preferably live) or a live example of what you have now that doesn't work then point out, relative to that, what you really want?
2013-05-09 07:29:40	schnoodles-osx	Umm I might quickly try and create a mockup. Unfortunately its a PSD of client work that I cannot show :(
2013-05-09 07:30:39	AMcBain	test-cases and simple examples care not, just enough to demonstrate what you want
2013-05-09 07:31:11	AMcBain	but I can cut you off early: if it's a shadow, just use box-shadow. Quick, easy, customizable, and does what you want with no tricks.

2013-05-09 07:38:21	AMcBain	schnoodles-osx, check out http://temp.asmcbain.net/htmlcss/dropshadow-layout/dropshadow%20content.html . Now, your example isn't a shadow, but this one doesn't do it like a standard box-shadow. If I applied a box-shadow inset to #content, nav and Header sections would cover it up. As well as any real content extending out that far in the white area.
2013-05-09 07:38:47	AMcBain	Inspect #content and take a look at the pseudo-elements. Just do that, but make the appropriate left and right adjustments to be negative the width of the image.
2013-05-09 07:39:06	AMcBain	One useful thing you can employ is that the content property doesn't need to be "" if you don't intend to have text.

2013-05-09 08:07:28	AMcBain	I also don't quite get what you want ... however, an observation based on your CSS is that you made an element height: 100%; hid overflow, and then made a child larger than its effective height.
2013-05-09 08:07:50	AMcBain	So setting scroll on the html tag isn't going to do anything. Nevermind that one of the html/body elements scrolls by default when there's too much content anyway.

2013-05-09 11:16:29	SteveC	ravenzz: Making it a button makes no difference (other than making it 3D which I don't want!).  I can't accept that it would look bad in IE7,8 and only really fix it in IE9+ - so no, not much use.  It's annoying - I can get the cart to scale in a div that takes the whole screen and I can get a div that is only as big as the containing text.  I just can't get both to happen at once.
2013-05-09 11:17:13	fabioportieri	damn my pants are too tight i'm really uncomfortable

2013-05-09 12:32:19	esya	Hi guys. Anyone knows a way to write a css selector that finds if the attribute has a substring in it?
2013-05-09 12:32:30	esya	Problem is, *= doesnt work here
2013-05-09 12:32:48	oksushi	esya: testcase showing what you want to select?
2013-05-09 12:32:50	esya	Because i want 'test' to match the attribute value 'this is a test'
2013-05-09 12:32:55	oksushi	and what you tried?
2013-05-09 12:32:59	esya	Sure
2013-05-09 12:33:36	esya	[data-name*='word']
2013-05-09 12:33:50	oksushi	use $=
2013-05-09 12:34:01	esya	Nope, it can be in the middle as well

2013-05-09 15:33:38	introom	hi. css gurus. I am in a very standstill situation. I've know some basics about css. But whenver I myself write css, I found it cumbersome to put the elements in the way I like. I've gone a lot of basic css tutorials, but my skill doesn't go up. Do you have any recommendation, any tutorial on building a real website, instead of talking about the grammars of css ?

If you check it, the image should start from the top and end right before the white div, right now its like 23px down

I have a page with a menu bar, and then some content beneith. problem: the menu bar has dropdown submenus and those overflow from the menu (this is intented), however, when this overflow happens (i.e. submenu shows) it is placed under other content on the page, i tried fixing this with z-indexes, without succes. what am i doing wrong?

2013-05-09 18:03:36	dylukes	However, inline-block is whitespace dependent so the behaviour is only correct when there is proper spacing between <li> tags.

2013-05-10 04:50:59	OneTech	I do...
2013-05-10 04:51:02	ryan--	but in essence, you would link out to a .css, which contains all the css info to overwrite what's defined already, so cosmetically it would utilise that after
2013-05-10 04:51:23	ryan--	so go google how to create and link .css externally
2013-05-10 04:51:30	ryan--	but you should ask them permission first

It is marked up the same way as everything else and used to be in the right location but for some reason it is no longer where it should be on the Rx4 page compared to the rest of the website. http://www.innermindco.com/captcha/cac/rx4.html

2013-05-10 18:01:23	JoshuaJones	Media Queries lets you adjust the styling of elements if your device or browser window matches whatever you say
2013-05-10 18:01:43	SmashingX	ohh I think I know where that comes from
2013-05-10 18:01:47	JoshuaJones	so if you want the main div to start clipping to the left when it goes below, say 1024px, then you wrap that in a media query
2013-05-10 18:01:51	SmashingX	is in the PHP code isn't?

2013-05-10 18:02:12	JoshuaJones	SmashingX: are you using a cms to generate pages?
2013-05-10 18:02:18	SmashingX	yes
2013-05-10 18:02:34	JoshuaJones	then safe to assume the cms might be adding stuff inline

2013-05-10 18:02:42	JoshuaJones	that or any javascript plugins you may have
2013-05-10 18:02:49	SmashingX	yeah
2013-05-10 18:03:24	SmashingX	but I don't know why the heck when I add a new rule .container-12.clearfix {margin-bottom: 20px;}
2013-05-10 18:03:27	SmashingX	it looks ugly
2013-05-10 18:03:44	SmashingX	changes other regions of the page
2013-05-10 18:04:03	SmashingX	but If I add that property to the inline rule, it looks fine
2013-05-10 18:04:08	JoshuaJones	hunt down why the cms/js is adding that random line of styling?

2013-05-11 01:31:12	d3m0n	And kind defeats the purpose of "loading" if the gif is big in size.

2013-05-11 01:42:49	Streusel	Hi there, I was wondering how I'd highlight an entire row, I can currently highlight the text in a given row, but not the entire row
2013-05-11 01:42:54	Streusel	width: 100% isn't doing it for me
2013-05-11 01:43:21	Vasa	highlight? maybe it has to do something with select?
2013-05-11 01:43:30	RNT	i have another question, as i said, i want to load images in that div, and bcz is a delay until the image is loaded, i was forced to add background-color:black in the div to avoid a ugly aspect at the beginning
2013-05-11 01:43:33	Streusel	doesn't need to be selected or hovered
2013-05-11 01:44:15	RNT	i observed if i add background-color:black before background-image is ok,but i don't think is a proffessional way to fix the things
2013-05-11 01:44:19	RNT	any idea?
2013-05-11 01:45:17	RNT	the row is inside what?
2013-05-11 01:45:24	Vasa	doesn't seem like a bad solution to me
2013-05-11 01:45:45	RNT	is not bad, but unproffessional
2013-05-11 01:45:57	Vasa	well i am not a proffesional so :P
2013-05-11 01:46:12	Vasa	seems fine to me tho
2013-05-11 01:46:15	RNT	background-color MUSt be before background-image
2013-05-11 01:46:41	Vasa	but as you said, it is before
2013-05-11 01:46:47	RNT	yes :)
2013-05-11 01:46:49	Vasa	and i don't see why it matters the order
2013-05-11 01:47:01	d3m0n	o.O
2013-05-11 01:47:05	RNT	in this case is matter very much

2013-05-11 08:30:47	aliensky	i can center it now, but the menu items are not inline, i set the li to display inline and ul display block

2013-05-11 08:36:57	Mrono	Is it possible to make an element float but still take up space in it's original position
2013-05-11 08:37:07	Mrono	I have a floating menu at the top but want to ensure the spacing is correct
2013-05-11 08:37:15	Mrono	and things don't get covered up

2013-05-11 08:37:57	Mrono	not float, fixed
2013-05-11 08:37:58	oksushi	obviously not everything
2013-05-11 08:38:05	oksushi	aliensky: just start over using my example
2013-05-11 08:38:13	oksushi	remove all of your CSS that relates to the menu
2013-05-11 08:38:30	oksushi	Mrono: fixed pos is out of the flow.
2013-05-11 08:39:52	Mrono	oksushi: yeah, so i'll have to place in an empty space at the top of the page then?
2013-05-11 08:40:14	Jastori	i have a column that blocks automatically, such as a one_third, etc. I want to put a picturein the column but have the edges of the picture pushed to the edges of the blocked column
2013-05-11 08:40:29	oksushi	I don’t know what you’re trying to do. If you have a top fixed nav, try adding an equivalent padd-top to the next element
2013-05-11 08:40:32	oksushi	*padding
2013-05-11 08:40:44	Jastori	the issue is that the text below the pictute now gets pulled to the edges since the padding affects the entire column bloc instead of only where the picture is
2013-05-11 08:40:59	Mrono	oksushi: mmk, thanks :)

2013-05-11 09:55:53	oksushi	can you be specific?
2013-05-11 09:56:00	thomedy	in this example if i want to  move my content divs around to the right place i have to use padding but i sense long term problems
2013-05-11 09:56:19	thomedy	if you go to the url i linked it shows content containers
2013-05-11 09:56:25	darkmutt	thomedy, from what i see you only have a top and bottom margin specified for li's inside submenu

2013-05-11 10:01:32	oksushi	exactly. 'Reduce' a testcase

2013-05-11 10:01:37	Selvvir2	thomedy, a (pared-down) testcase is a page that isolates the problem with the minimum required markup, styling and scripting. See `paste for services that easily let you create such testcases for others to see.
2013-05-11 10:01:38	thomedy	i would do that but i dont know how to duplicate it.. because it only happens sometimes

2013-05-11 11:09:26	ravenzz	alphanum testimonials could be good for his "image"
2013-05-11 11:09:34	AMcBain	alphanum, if you're willing to suggest that buying Twitter followers is a good idea, then you were hooked by them. You are a sucker.
2013-05-11 11:10:08	AMcBain	Followers will appear if you have something worthwhile to say and have a good service. You don't need to buy fake people to pretend.

2013-05-11 11:10:26	AMcBain	darkmutt, uh, hi. I vaguely remember something ... inward rounded corners?

2013-05-11 11:10:58	AMcBain	alphanum, but it's NOT good. That's why you're a sucker. You're paying fro something that takes almost no work whatsoever and gains you noting.
2013-05-11 11:10:59	ravenzz	alphanum I mean even for free stuff is a bad idea to buy followers. You should care only about real users/customers who are really interested in your product

2013-05-11 11:16:24	hawtin	making it in IE
2013-05-11 11:16:35	alphanum	ok, what i'm saying is the fans are worthless, sure.. but if a person who doesn't know anything about hosting looks at his page and sees the facebook likes and twitter followers, it will give his hosting company authority with the viewer. an edge. the edge that may or may not make a viewer buy his hosting. which is important, to make sales. sales is key. how you are viewed is key. your credibility
2013-05-11 11:16:35	alphanum	with the customer, your image, is key. it is really important to 'look' credible, even if you have no substance to back it up. in fact, a highly-qualified customer will walk away even if he likes the price, likes the features, and was looking for the product if the customer thinks the seller has no credibility. this is why suggesting fake facebook fans and fake twitter fans is perhaps a good idea,
2013-05-11 11:16:35	alphanum	even though it may just be a show of valueless pomp.

2013-05-11 12:24:30	AMcBain	The old bot's page had a search on the page for filtering stuff out and loaded faster. Mine probably would too if I cached it.

2013-05-11 12:28:41	reisio	yeah that's tedious
2013-05-11 12:28:46	reisio	it's easy to find good names
2013-05-11 12:28:56	reisio	but you'll probably go through 50-75 before you come up with an unsquatted domain
2013-05-11 12:29:01	reisio	that'll all change after I buy a knife, though
2013-05-11 12:29:35	AMcBain	I don't really do anything that I feel is worth a full domain name. So far everything has lived as a subdomain just fine.
2013-05-11 12:29:53	darkmutt	xD reisio that is an awesome way to think i know a guy with a bazooka near his tv i can help if we pool up for a couple missiles XD
2013-05-11 12:29:56	reisio	yeah but you will, or you'll get out of the game altogether

2013-05-11 12:34:35	reisio	well, it keeps archive.org from being sued into oblivion

I have different styles (alternative stylesheets) right now, and I want to include them too. Some of them share code (it's one basic stylesheet and alternate colors). How can I reuse the shared code without repeating it (and increasing the file size)?

2013-05-11 18:14:27	AndreaRu_	danjones0108, you also shouldn't really be modifying CSS live in the WordPress editor.  You can, but it's cumbersome and has no undo, plus it takes longer and leaves you with no backups.

2013-05-11 21:24:02	AlbinoGeek	A p element's end tag may be omitted if the p element is immediately followed by an address, article, aside, blockquote, dir, div, dl, fieldset, footer, form, h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6, header, hgroup, hr, main, menu, nav, ol, p, pre, section, table, or ul, element, or if there is no more content in the parent element and the parent element is not an a element.
2013-05-11 21:24:11	AlbinoGeek	It all made sense until I read that.
2013-05-11 21:24:19	AlbinoGeek	HTML5 confirmed for Markdown
2013-05-11 21:24:20	yellowfish	ctienrsg, whats the simplest / most commonly used
2013-05-11 21:24:25	ctienrsg	You may put ur inputs into a fieldset, or u may put them into a paragraph
2013-05-11 21:24:32	ctienrsg	yellowfish: I think that is most easy
2013-05-11 21:24:40	AlbinoGeek	"Every end tag may be omitted if there is nothing more in the parent"

2013-05-12 01:24:00	RabSimpson	lakcaj: thanks for your reply but i've got it sorted, i ended up just using absolute positioning for the sidebar. the whole block was previously appearing below the #primary column but floated to the left.
2013-05-12 01:24:39	RabSimpson	lakcaj: i've since added in other elements which are moving the alignment about to appear how i want it aesthetically.

2013-05-12 01:57:58	Rainier	IRC is not always instantaneous.
2013-05-12 01:58:31	RabSimpson	my point was look at the level of conversation between the people joining and leaving - none
2013-05-12 01:58:54	RabSimpson	people are coming and going, but nobody is saying anything, almost like they're coming and going out of sheer habit

2013-05-12 02:00:08	Rainier	It's inane banter.
2013-05-12 02:00:43	RabSimpson	like you asked, who cares? it's better than dead silence. what's the point of being in an channel that's broadcasting dead air?

2013-05-12 02:01:07	Rainier	RabSimpson, then you don't have to be here at all, rather than commenting on it. There's nothing wrong with "dead air" in a channel.
2013-05-12 02:01:19	Rainier	IRC won't explode if it goes 20 minutes with nobody saying anything.

2013-05-12 02:02:10	Rainier	It's a waste of time? because I thought perhaps you had a real question, and were just asking to ask?
2013-05-12 02:02:18	RabSimpson	instead of bitching about someone saying something, how about you go see your local surgeon and have that stick pulled out?
2013-05-12 02:02:32	RabSimpson	i wasn't asking to ask.
2013-05-12 02:02:37	RabSimpson	i don't ask to ask.
2013-05-12 02:02:45	Rainier	After you, then, sir.
2013-05-12 02:03:03	RabSimpson	no no, after you, seeing as you're the one who started this crap.

2013-05-12 02:04:31	AndreaRu_	People don't come and go on IRC out of habit.  Most of us have clients that simply connect us to our selected channels when we sign on, and we leave them when we disconnect.  It's an automatic process, but connecting doesn't necessarily mean we have something specific to say in every single channel we join.

2013-05-12 07:01:06	paulvd	that br is not working, try changing it to a div and give it a height or you can use margin-bottom instead of br

2013-05-12 07:13:56	StoneGiant	Hello! I have a question for anyone who might be available. I have a <div> for my main content area, and in the layout I did in Photoshop I had flourishes in the top left and top right corners of the div which go slightly outside of the content area box. Is there a way to do reproduce this with HTML/CSS without just using an image file for the content box? http://i.imgur.com/uK1KM2H.jpg (this is
2013-05-12 07:13:57	StoneGiant	the layout, you can see the flourishes I'm trying to achieve), http://conquest.co.nf/ (this is what I have worked into html/css thus far). Any help would be greatly appreciated!
2013-05-12 07:16:17	AMcBain	StoneGiant, since there's only two of them, just use :before and :after elements.
2013-05-12 07:16:32	AMcBain	If you set the content property of them to url(...) they'll behave kind of as if they were img tags.
2013-05-12 07:16:49	AMcBain	Then just absolutely position them against the parent there just outside the edges.
2013-05-12 07:17:21	Jester	oksushi: back to square one with the text - but its close i think
2013-05-12 07:17:22	AMcBain	Make sure the item you apply the :before and :after to is set to a position value that's not static so that it will contain the pseudo-elements.
2013-05-12 07:17:33	AMcBain	relative will work if you don't want any other side-effects.

2013-05-12 14:47:22	platzhirsch	Munter_: no, not exactly. I could do that. But Bootstrap already defines some nice classes to color table rows ("success", "error", "alert", etc.). And I would like to use these classes to color my table cells <td> only and I wondered whether it is possible to make td inherit these class rules

2013-05-12 14:51:15	Munter_	platzhirsch: I guess not, unless they made them as a mixin. However having a mixin to apply a single color seems wrong. Why not just create those classes yourself and refer to the relevant less variables with the tble row colors?

2013-05-13 16:28:56	Camber	In my test case, there are two containers. Each contain two divs floating left. The first container contains divs which are 78px in width, plus another 2 px for the border. In the second container, I have removed the border to the divs, and added the 2 px back into the width of each of them. They seem to act similarly at 100% zoom. But if you zoom out in chrome or firefox (and possible IE, I'm yet to test), the divs with the borders clear left. Could anyone tell

2013-05-13 16:32:32	Camber	Just going to sum up my issue into a single message for clarity.
2013-05-13 16:32:36	Camber	Hi guys, I have a CSS issue here, which I'm sure is well documented, but I can't find anything on it... I guess I need pointing in the right direction. I have simplified it as well as I can here: http://jsfiddle.net/6J7sP/ In my test case, there are two containers. Each contain two divs floating left. The first container contains divs which are 78px in width, plus another 2 px for the border. In the second container, I have removed the border to the divs, and add
2013-05-13 16:32:37	Camber	2 px back into the width of each of them. They seem to act similarly at 100% zoom. But if you zoom out in chrome or firefox (and possible IE, I'm yet to test), the divs with the borders clear left. Could anyone tell me why?

2013-05-13 20:58:40	nemo	sunbeam: you can use it to do tricks like swapping order of inline elements, which is really an abuse of it I guess
2013-05-13 20:58:57	nemo	sunbeam: or maybe your text really should be rtl - can indicate that in unicode too ofc

2013-05-13 20:59:44	sunbeam	and not about the page object flow
2013-05-13 20:59:53	gkatsev	nemo: like, in my example, we have transistion-delay on both .bar and .foo:hover + .bar. When we hover on .foo, the "new" selector for .bar will be .foo:hover + .bar and when we un-hover, the "new" one will be just .bar again.

2013-05-14 02:18:33	m4ng0s	thats done by your httpd daemon
2013-05-14 02:18:43	m4ng0s	apache / nginx, w/e.
