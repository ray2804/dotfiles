2013-04-23 20:49:39	jParkton	I can understand to an extent but when someone corrects English it should not be simply "Haha you say wrong, you dumb foreigner" it should be more for clarity, ask questions don't just point and laugh

2013-04-23 21:04:06	GarethAdams	the key to tabular data is that every item in a column, and every item in a row, are related in some way
2013-04-23 21:04:11	Qbix1	tables for layout is one thing. But why do people go out of their way to use divs and li's for things that clearly have several fields?

2013-04-24 22:02:55	yoshie902a	Hi all, emergency. we just launched a website and now we are getting calls that it does not work in IE 8 and before.   Are there resources to run tests on what code is incompatible?  Also, is there a way to extract the rendered CSS directly from the browser to eliminate any media queries?
2013-04-24 22:02:57	Cow_woC	aFeijo: Not sure, but you could use JS to remove the transition before fading back on, then re-set the transition again.

I have used debug tools for firefox/chrome on mac (my machine) and was hoping for a tool to down load a rendered version of the CSS, with the media query stuff removed and only show the CSS specific to the current view.  Is there any way to do this?

2013-04-25 00:58:51	jParkton	ohai
2013-04-25 00:59:08	Cow_woC	What's a good way to implement a fixed-size column on the right, and a dynamic-sized column on the left that grows to fill the remaining space?

2013-04-25 00:59:19	Cow_woC	reisio, jParkton: Hi guys :)
2013-04-25 00:59:34	Cow_woC	I tried http://stackoverflow.com/q/16201617/14731 but as you can see I ran into some nasty bugs.
2013-04-25 01:00:04	Cow_woC	Is there a way to implement this without some hacky margin-right?

2013-04-25 01:02:32	jParkton	no clue really, as with all things programming if $A doesnt work as expected use $B
2013-04-25 01:02:58	reisio	Cow_woC: ordinary float: http://css.maxdesign.com.au/floatutorial/
2013-04-25 01:03:26	Cow_woC	reisio: I tried that, but it doesn't jive well with max-width/height on the left column
2013-04-25 01:03:58	reisio	how so?
2013-04-25 01:04:14	Cow_woC	reisio: Meaning, when you shrink the window horizontally, eventually the float needs to squeeze the left column but instead one just goes into one row and another into another row.

2013-04-25 01:05:36	Cow_woC	reisio: I want the columns to always extend from top to bottom. The left column fills the remaining space (down to 0). The right column always keeps its width.

2013-04-25 01:06:58	Cow_woC	The right column should have a width from say 200px down to 0px. It should also shrink as the window shrinks, but it should only begin shrinking after the left column has a width of 0.

2013-04-25 01:08:21	Cow_woC	I just changed my mind :) Okay... so I guess what I want is *both* columns to shrink to fit the screen... kind of like left column has 80%, right column 20%, but I also want to cap the maximum size of the right to say 200px. Is it possible to mix width: 20%, max-width: 200px?
2013-04-25 01:09:41	Cow_woC	Hmm, that worked :)
2013-04-25 01:10:07	reisio	gj
2013-04-25 01:10:17	Cow_woC	Sorry, nevermind then. I only thought about the 80/20% thing a few minutes ago. I was trying to use fixed width on the right before without giving the left a width.

2013-04-25 07:29:11	AMcBain	The silly thing is there's a picture-hosting site for a certain interest group built on frames and tables ... it didn't have keyboard navigation and someone asked a dev to do it. I managed to whip it up in Greasemonkey and it worked cross-frame, so focus in another meant left/right still worked as expected ... but the site dev wouldn't do it because it was "insecure" ... even worse, really, was that if any of the markup changes, either (
2013-04-25 07:29:11	AMcBain	I think) of those scripts will die.
2013-04-25 07:29:30	AMcBain	There's no class names or IDs on the appropriate things. It's "find the 3rd tr on this page, and if it has one or two anchors in it, we found the right place"
2013-04-25 07:29:46	AMcBain	Without tables, that would be so much easier and less fragile.

2013-04-25 07:30:34	AMcBain	and the script to do it is incredibly short.

2013-04-25 10:17:24	AMcBain	Schonert, what I suggest is either a) black out around it so the letter boxing isn't obvious, b) design around the letter boxing so it looks better, c) use some media queries (if possible?) or JavaScript to determine which dimension is smaller. Set that one to 100%.

2013-04-25 11:14:45	alex___	When you float an element to wrap around it some text, something, you want the rest of the content not to write
2013-04-25 11:15:18	alex___	you use clear on the next element you don't want to wrap, and that works
2013-04-25 11:16:03	alex___	but when the element parent is delimited with a background-color or border, it does not consider the floatted element which overflow and that sucks
2013-04-25 11:16:22	alex___	that is why many designer add this at the end of the parent div :
2013-04-25 11:16:23	alex___	<p style="clear:both">&nbsp;</p>

2013-04-25 23:32:36	herbnerder	and the other (admittedly small) is that user zoom is taken into account. so if somebody were to bump the font size up manually your media queries would account for that
2013-04-25 23:32:54	reisio	hrmm?
2013-04-25 23:32:59	herbnerder	but, that's a pretty small benefit

2013-04-25 23:34:06	reisio	yeah?
2013-04-25 23:34:17	herbnerder	if the user bumps up their font size so much that the 3 column media query is no longer true, it will use the tablet based layout
