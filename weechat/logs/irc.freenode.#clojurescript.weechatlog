2013-04-02 14:15:29	wei_	how would you set up cljs to build a module inside of a requirejs project?
2013-04-02 14:36:43	kalasjohnny2000	wei_, try to set the output of your lein cljsbuild auto of your cljs-module in whitespace mode and the let requirejs take care of the advanced compilation of the whole project_
2013-04-02 14:36:45	kalasjohnny2000	?
2013-04-02 14:37:14	kalasjohnny2000	and make sure the output file (.js) is somewhere where requirejs can reach it
2013-04-02 14:37:57	wei_	i see, thanks.
2013-04-02 14:37:58	kalasjohnny2000	I think  the (ns some.thing) just converts to a goog.provide("some.thing")...
2013-04-02 14:38:24	wei_	does that conflict with the package manager for requirejs?
2013-04-02 14:39:57	wei_	also, why not advanced compilation? if you let requirejs take care of minification, then you lose the Closure Library/Closure compiler coupling right?
2013-04-02 14:49:02	kalasjohnny2000	I don't know much about requirejs but according to the website it seems to use google closures mechanism of package managing (the same as clojurescript). RequireJS can use Google Closure Compiler, so if you use it, you can do the whole project minification in requirejs.
2013-04-02 14:49:34	kalasjohnny2000	Don't use any other minification there, if you want to do that, use advanced mode directly in cljsbuild... :)
2013-04-02 14:51:50	kalasjohnny2000	I mean you really want to do advanced compilation somewhere, but do it as late as possible, so you get as much code deleted as possible
