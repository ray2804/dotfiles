2012-12-27 20:35:29	terietor	hello
2012-12-27 20:36:09	terietor	I want to make an authenticated request with http.get
2012-12-27 20:36:31	terietor	my code works for non authenticated requests but not for authenticated ones
2012-12-27 20:36:36	terietor	this is my code, http://paste.kde.org/632390/

2012-12-27 20:39:37	Pickels	terietor: where does http.get come from?
2012-12-27 20:40:06	Pickels	Also are you writing some kind of framework cause the code looks a bit weird.
2012-12-27 20:40:36	terietor	Pickels what do you mean? do you mean where is the var http = require('http'); ?
2012-12-27 20:41:15	Pickels	ah so it's the http module.
2012-12-27 20:41:25	terietor	yes its the one from node.js
2012-12-27 20:42:21	Pickels	Seems you are wrapping some express logic which makes it hard to see what's wrong
2012-12-27 20:43:25	terietor	Pickels I believe that the issue is somewhere between the lines 38-40
2012-12-27 20:43:43	terietor	those are the lines in which I add the auth stuff for the request
2012-12-27 20:46:13	Pickels	Yeah, most likely.
2012-12-27 20:46:45	Pickels	Is there a reason you are using custom functions over just middleware?
2012-12-27 20:47:08	terietor	Pickels what do you mean? what kind of middleware?
2012-12-27 20:47:17	terietor	I have two web apps
2012-12-27 20:47:36	terietor	the first one is the server(its express) and the second one is the client(express)
2012-12-27 20:47:36	Pickels	Well it looks like you are passing req and res to functions that almost look like middleware.
2012-12-27 20:47:51	Pickels	the bodegamanager is the client I guess?
2012-12-27 20:47:57	terietor	yes
2012-12-27 20:49:57	terietor	I want to access the url example.gr/participant/info
2012-12-27 20:50:11	terietor	which needs auth
2012-12-27 20:50:14	terietor	so I tried
2012-12-27 20:50:25	terietor	this user:pass@example.gr/participant/info at the browser
2012-12-27 20:50:28	terietor	but it didn't workj
2012-12-27 20:50:32	terietor	*work
2012-12-27 20:51:05	terietor	in order to auth, I send a url like example.gr/auth?username=foo?password=foo2?device=foo3
2012-12-27 20:51:23	Pickels	and what error are you getting? 404?
2012-12-27 20:53:23	aandy	https:* hopefully :p
2012-12-27 20:53:29	terietor	I don't get any error. I receive a json reply(that's normal) which says unauthorized

2012-12-30 17:25:44	manuelbieh	anyone here who can tell me how i can get "subtemplates" (partials?) working in mustache with express?
2012-12-30 17:26:35	manuelbieh	i have 2 files: views/main.html and views/form.html. within the main template i have: {{> form}}
2012-12-30 17:27:02	manuelbieh	i actually thought mustache/express would show the content of form.html now. but it does not :(

2012-12-30 23:48:10	beeeviiz	can somebody explain that strange behavior?
2012-12-30 23:48:12	beeeviiz	http://pastebin.com/QCkqBhAY
2012-12-30 23:48:34	beeeviiz	when i enter a page for the first time, everything is correct
2012-12-30 23:49:35	beeeviiz	when i reload the page i get an error "Error: ENOENT, open /var/www/<!DOCTYPE html>.....</html>.html"
2012-12-30 23:50:19	beeeviiz	when I don't use the "parts" variable but pass the partials as option to the res.render() function instead, everything works fine
2012-12-30 23:51:37	danielsv	have you tried renaming "parts"?
2012-12-30 23:51:41	danielsv	maybe its reserved somehow
2012-12-30 23:52:23	beeeviiz	haha. when i put it in a closure it works fine
2012-12-30 23:52:41	beeeviiz	var parts = (function() { return { head: '_head', ....});
2012-12-30 23:53:01	beeeviiz	res.render('index.html', {partials: parts()})M
2012-12-30 23:53:03	beeeviiz	weird

2012-12-30 23:56:04	danielsv	seems like the rendered html is written to the parts object
2012-12-30 23:56:09	danielsv	still weird though

2013-01-01 14:03:25	manuelbieh	can anyone tell me how i can have an express app listening to two different hosts on the same port? is that possible?
2013-01-01 14:03:56	manuelbieh	i tried app.listen(8088, 'myhost.net'); app.listen(8088, 'myhost.com');

2013-01-02 18:19:15	warz	hi all. im trying to include some JSON in a jade template. in my template, i've got something like this, inside of a script tag:
2013-01-02 18:19:29	warz	var foo = '#{ JSON.stringify( ... ) }';
2013-01-02 18:20:11	warz	this works, but if an property of the Object im stringifying contains a single quote " ' "
2013-01-02 18:20:26	warz	it breaks in the browser which makes sense
2013-01-02 18:20:32	warz	but how can i do this, then?
2013-01-02 18:21:34	warz	i need to somehow escape it

2013-01-02 21:51:55	kaepora	Pickels: Nope, it's cookies
2013-01-02 21:52:02	kaepora	I deleted the cookie and the session reset
2013-01-02 21:52:11	Pickels	yeah but memory sessions also use cookies
2013-01-02 21:52:14	Pickels	all sessions uses cookies
2013-01-02 21:52:25	Pickels	that's why you need to cookieParser for any kind of sessions
2013-01-02 21:52:38	Pickels	but if you restart the server the server-side data gets removed
2013-01-02 21:53:13	kaepora	Aaah I see

2013-01-04 13:02:46	stagas	Deathspike: in the middleware you have access to req/res in scope

2013-01-04 13:07:48	Deathspike	stagas: Thanks for the feedback, but that is not what I am after. Every middleware that uses render and the template engine has to be intercepted to render the template client-side when this is possible. For this, I change app.render because all render calls pass through here. I want to check if the request is made with XHR, and if so, send the options as JSON instead of doing template rendering.
2013-01-04 13:07:48	Deathspike	This way the client-side framework can pick it up and render locally, preserving my server and bandwidth.
2013-01-04 13:08:00	Deathspike	Hence, I really need req/res access in app.render, but am clueless how to get it.

However when displaying this on another page p=some.variable seems that all newlines and spacing is stripped.  Going back into the edit page the values are still there. How do I get it to correctly display spacing?

2013-01-05 00:32:03	@tjholowaychuk	by accident kind of

2013-01-05 00:36:47	AntelopeSalad	how did you figure that out by accident
2013-01-05 00:37:17	@tjholowaychuk	he saw x-powered-by in their http -> https redirect server so i investigated the main app itself
2013-01-05 00:37:29	@tjholowaychuk	and the header field order lines up 1-to-1 with express
2013-01-05 00:37:37	@tjholowaychuk	and you can curl favicon.ico
2013-01-05 00:37:40	@tjholowaychuk	to see that as well
2013-01-05 00:37:43	@tjholowaychuk	favicon() middleware
2013-01-05 00:37:49	@tjholowaychuk	AND -X OPTIONS does not work
2013-01-05 00:37:54	@tjholowaychuk	so it's express 3.x
2013-01-05 00:37:59	@tjholowaychuk	because i removed that recently
2013-01-05 00:38:06	@tjholowaychuk	AND
2013-01-05 00:38:26	@tjholowaychuk	 Accept: text/plain on a redirect is supported and has the exact format res.redirect() does
2013-01-05 00:38:46	AntelopeSalad	seems like good enough evidence to me
2013-01-05 00:38:47	@tjholowaychuk	there's no escaping x-powered-by haha
2013-01-05 00:39:00	@tjholowaychuk	too many subtle things to pick up on
2013-01-05 00:39:01	AntelopeSalad	i didn't see the x-powered-by when i looked at the headers
2013-01-05 00:39:08	@tjholowaychuk	curl http://
2013-01-05 00:39:11	@tjholowaychuk	instead of https
2013-01-05 00:39:54	AntelopeSalad	HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
2013-01-05 00:39:54	AntelopeSalad	X-Powered-By: Express
2013-01-05 00:40:34	@tjholowaychuk	wonder if they will get mad if i add it to the site hahaha
2013-01-05 00:40:58	AntelopeSalad	don't do it
2013-01-05 00:41:09	@tjholowaychuk	yeah probably not a good idea
2013-01-05 00:41:18	AntelopeSalad	you need to think of the long term
2013-01-05 00:41:40	AntelopeSalad	you should patch in some really subtle security vulnerability, then get contact info from celebs and sell it on the black market
2013-01-05 00:41:50	@tjholowaychuk	hahahahah

2013-01-05 00:43:12	AntelopeSalad	i can't see them minding really though, worst case scenario they ask you to take it down
2013-01-05 00:44:17	@tjholowaychuk	just the security aspect but who knows, Drupal etc have very open policies about security flaws and they dont get into shit
2013-01-05 00:44:32	@tjholowaychuk	they email you when a new flaw is discovered haha so within the update window
2013-01-05 00:44:34	@tjholowaychuk	you coudl go hack
2013-01-05 00:44:36	@tjholowaychuk	a ton of sites
2013-01-05 00:44:46	AntelopeSalad	i think anyone who woke up one day and was like... it's time to hack myspace...
2013-01-05 00:44:48	@tjholowaychuk	it's a little odd but that's no different than an issue tracker really
2013-01-05 00:44:55	AntelopeSalad	they would find out it's using express in about 10 minutes

2013-01-05 00:45:07	@tjholowaychuk	maybe
2013-01-05 00:45:12	@tjholowaychuk	they're pretty subtle clues though
2013-01-05 00:45:26	@tjholowaychuk	other than the x-powered-by hahaha
2013-01-05 00:45:35	AntelopeSalad	yeah the powered by is a dead give away

2013-01-05 00:46:43	AntelopeSalad	that is really cool though, that would be the first really huge site using express then right?

2013-01-05 00:47:29	@tjholowaychuk	i have a big list to update the site with but i've been too lazy to take all the screens

2013-01-05 00:49:11	AntelopeSalad	i wonder what kind of traffic they are still getting
2013-01-05 00:49:40	@tjholowaychuk	not sure
2013-01-05 00:50:03	@tjholowaychuk	the profile page thing i checked had a ~250ms response but that would be all db shit
2013-01-05 00:51:12	AntelopeSalad	the signin page took 245ms here
2013-01-05 00:51:29	AntelopeSalad	most of the time was waiting for a response
2013-01-05 00:51:29	@tjholowaychuk	poor caching
2013-01-05 00:52:03	@tjholowaychuk	that's a pretty large delay for the signup page haha
2013-01-05 00:52:05	@tjholowaychuk	seeing as it does nothing
2013-01-05 00:52:06	AntelopeSalad	they have a response-time in the response header though, that's showing 15ms
2013-01-05 00:52:15	@tjholowaychuk	ah
2013-01-05 00:52:23	@tjholowaychuk	transfer then
2013-01-05 00:53:00	AntelopeSalad	that 15ms is what exactly? everything it took the server to create the response but not including the transfer?
2013-01-05 00:53:44	@tjholowaychuk	that's on writeHead basically
2013-01-05 00:55:18	AntelopeSalad	just going over the video preview now
2013-01-05 00:55:28	AntelopeSalad	ignoring traffic, the site itself looks like it has a ton of stuff

2013-01-05 20:09:55	@tjholowaychuk	all or nothing, however you can check if (!req.secure
2013-01-05 20:09:59	@tjholowaychuk	and redirect to https etc
2013-01-05 20:10:11	@tjholowaychuk	but the routes would be there for both
2013-01-05 20:11:40	plato	so, do I need to duplicate my entire application? and run the latter as https?

2013-01-05 21:51:56	Gracana	I am confused... In the expressjs FAQ, there is an example on how to prefix a pathname for serving static files. The example and the answer text seem totally unrelated. What am I missing?
2013-01-05 21:52:13	Gracana	Suppose if you wanted "GET /files/javascripts/jquery.js", you could mount the middleware at "/files", exposing "/javascripts/jquery.js" as the req.url allowing the middleware to serve the file:
2013-01-05 21:52:21	Gracana	app.use('/public', express.static('public'));
2013-01-05 21:52:36	Gracana	Where did public come from? Whaaa?
2013-01-05 21:52:49	@tjholowaychuk	Gracana what happens is the app.use() prefix is effectively just stripped (for that middleware only)
2013-01-05 21:52:58	@tjholowaychuk	so static() only sees req.url as "/javascripts/jquery.js"
2013-01-05 21:53:08	@tjholowaychuk	then adds that string to the path you specified with static(path)
2013-01-05 21:53:14	@tjholowaychuk	ignoring the prefix
2013-01-05 21:53:36	Gracana	Oh so the example just shows what you would do if you had previously mounted the middleware at /files somewhere else?
2013-01-05 21:54:14	@tjholowaychuk	static() just takes the req.url and sees if there's a file with that name
2013-01-05 21:54:36	@tjholowaychuk	so if you have GET /public/foo.js and it's mounted at '/'
2013-01-05 21:54:38	@tjholowaychuk	it'll try to do
2013-01-05 21:54:42	@tjholowaychuk	./public/public/foo.js
2013-01-05 21:54:48	@tjholowaychuk	mount it at /public to strip that prefix
2013-01-05 21:54:49	@tjholowaychuk	./public/foo.js
2013-01-05 21:55:01	Gracana	ahhhh
2013-01-05 21:55:09	@tjholowaychuk	it's really simple but a little hard to explain
2013-01-05 21:56:02	Gracana	I'm actually using restify, but the documentation there is somewhat incomplete, though it's supposed to be based on express, which is how I got to the FAQ.
2013-01-05 21:56:11	Gracana	but I think that explains my difficulties
2013-01-05 21:56:15	@tjholowaychuk	ah i see
2013-01-05 21:56:20	@tjholowaychuk	i have no clue if restify supports that or not
2013-01-05 21:56:36	@tjholowaychuk	it's not based on express though
2013-01-05 21:56:38	@tjholowaychuk	it's just a clone thing
2013-01-05 21:56:45	@tjholowaychuk	so it looks the same but it doesn't use express
2013-01-05 21:56:53	Gracana	yeah that is.. scary
2013-01-05 21:57:04	Gracana	not fully documented but sorta works the same :X
2013-01-05 21:57:19	@tjholowaychuk	you'd think joyent would want to contribute to their own ecosystem
2013-01-05 21:57:19	@tjholowaychuk	but hey

2013-01-05 22:00:13	hipsterslapfight	the amount of people reinventing express at the moment is scary
2013-01-05 22:00:40	@tjholowaychuk	oh well lol sometimes it's just people
2013-01-05 22:00:43	@tjholowaychuk	fooling around and learning
2013-01-05 22:01:45	hipsterslapfight	good point, it's a good way to learn i suppose. there's been a few reasonably large projects (*cough* npm website *cough*) lately though :v

2013-01-05 22:02:54	@tjholowaychuk	im still trying to figure out some best patterns for this component stuff then i might build a higher level thing
2013-01-05 22:02:57	@tjholowaychuk	on the two
2013-01-05 22:03:08	@tjholowaychuk	but it's really hard to write it in a non-leaky way
2013-01-05 22:03:15	@tjholowaychuk	that would work well for any app out there

2013-01-09 23:37:18	manuelbieh	i have a global function which returns "default" partials since express/consolidate obviously can't handle global partials
2013-01-09 23:38:39	manuelbieh	first of all you should move the app.get('*') part at the end as last route
2013-01-09 23:39:49	justin___	ok tryingthat now, but I feel i still have something fed up :/
2013-01-09 23:39:57	manuelbieh	2. you haven't defined a route for /login?!
2013-01-09 23:41:04	manuelbieh	app.post('/login', ...
2013-01-09 23:41:36	justin___	wait isn't this a route for login : app.get('/partials/:login', routes.login);

2013-01-09 23:42:00	manuelbieh	no
2013-01-09 23:42:25	justin___	i have this:
2013-01-09 23:42:26	manuelbieh	app.get('/partials/:login', routes.login) means
2013-01-09 23:42:26	justin___	app.post('/partials/:login',   passport.authenticate('mongoose', {     successRedirect: '/',     failureRedirect: '/login',     failureFlash: 'Invalid username or password.'   }) );
2013-01-09 23:43:02	manuelbieh	that routes.login is called when the user tries to access yourapp.com:3000/partials/something

2013-01-09 23:43:47	justin___	so how would i fix this?
2013-01-09 23:44:40	manuelbieh	and :login means that you can the part after /partials/ via req.params['something']
2013-01-09 23:44:40	manuelbieh	*can access*
2013-01-09 23:44:40	manuelbieh	try app.post('/login' instead of app.post('/partials/:login',
2013-01-09 23:44:50	justin___	i think i tried that before, but i'll try it again

2013-01-10 02:32:16	joshSzep	I'm having a strange issue with my stylesheet failing to load. Inspecting in the chrome debugger (and view source) I can see "<link ref="stylesheet" href="css/landing.css" />" is present in the header, but express logging is not reporting a GET for the resource. If i navigate explicitly to (host)/css/landing.css it does retrieve the stylesheet. Any ideas? I am also trying to use less-middleware
2013-01-10 02:35:14	hbeck	joshSzep: don't know less-middleware, but can you show a dpaste or something with a list of all the requests fired when you hit the page?
2013-01-10 02:35:36	hbeck	could be a path issue since you're doing relative instead of absolute, not sure

2013-01-10 21:05:46	jmar777	Deathspike: just saw your q. if your'e still looking for an answer, you can try req.headers.host
2013-01-10 21:06:18	jmar777	Deathspike: should give you something like 'localhost:3000" or 'localhost:4000'
2013-01-10 21:06:48	__underscore	jmar777: yeah TJ posted in here a few days ago, he figured out that new.myspace.com was using express through their headers
2013-01-10 21:07:09	__underscore	iirc they left the x-powered-by header on in a certain place too
2013-01-10 21:07:30	jmar777	__underscore: hm... i might make a chrome plugin that lets you know if it's an express app or not
2013-01-10 21:07:52	jmar777	__underscore: would be interesting to see how often it "lights up" (or whatever it does....)
2013-01-10 21:07:56	__underscore	that would be a cool idea. probably a lot of express sites still have that header set so in most cases it'd be really easy

2013-01-10 21:33:11	deedubs	and a 2 function calls every request ;)
2013-01-10 21:33:17	jmar777	.... and a middleware per req
2013-01-10 21:33:24	jmar777	^^ ya
2013-01-10 21:33:56	CoverSlide	o that was added in september
2013-01-10 21:34:02	CoverSlide	well glad he did that
2013-01-10 21:35:03	jmar777	i suffer from serious fanboism. tempted to add a `function (req, res, next) { req.headers['x-powered-by'] = 'Express, and proud of it!'; }`
2013-01-10 21:35:21	jmar777	err... and hopefully call `next()` in there at some point too...
2013-01-10 21:35:43	CoverSlide	req.headers['x-powered-by'] = '1 billion tiny hamsters'
2013-01-10 21:38:29	deedubs	x-powered-by: 'Rails 3.0.1 - Come at me bro'
2013-01-10 21:38:34	aandy	funny, i'm the opposite, this is standard in my express projects: app.use(function(q, s, n) { s.removeHeader('X-Powered-By'); s.header('X-Server-ID', NODE_ID })
2013-01-10 21:38:37	aandy	:p

2013-01-10 21:45:39	aandy	ah sorry. i do that myself on ssh/ftp banners, so i'm disappoint in myself i didn't catch it :(
2013-01-10 21:49:00	nlf	can i make trailing slashes in routes optional?
2013-01-10 21:49:25	aandy	/?
2013-01-10 21:49:31	aandy	if you're using regex
2013-01-10 21:50:48	aandy	e.g. app.get('/home/?', ...) will match both /home/ and /home
2013-01-10 21:50:56	nlf	turns out all i had to do was omit them from the route altogether
2013-01-10 21:51:04	nlf	app.get('/home' works for /home/ and /home
2013-01-10 21:51:12	aandy	:)
2013-01-10 21:51:14	nlf	but app.get('/home/' only works for /home/
2013-01-10 21:51:45	aandy	right, because "/home/" isn't part of "/home", but "/home" is part of both "/home" and "/home/"
2013-01-10 21:53:54	deedubs	by default they are optional
2013-01-10 21:54:37	deedubs	app.enable('strict routing'); to only allow exact matches
2013-01-10 21:58:36	timeturner	how can I match multiple routes
2013-01-10 21:59:19	timeturner	with a single page app all the routes basically just deliver the shell of the page
2013-01-10 21:59:26	deedubs	timeturner: to what end?
2013-01-10 21:59:48	timeturner	all of the routes deliver the html rendered from shell.jade
2013-01-10 21:59:54	timeturner	page.js takes over from there
2013-01-10 22:00:00	timeturner	so I basically need 3 or 4 routes
2013-01-10 22:00:04	timeturner	to match one callback
2013-01-10 22:00:14	timeturner	and then all my signup and confirmation stuff are separate routes
2013-01-10 22:00:19	deedubs	yeah I've been doing something like this https://gist.github.com/4505744
2013-01-10 22:00:39	deedubs	as the last middleware
2013-01-10 22:00:50	timeturner	brilliant
2013-01-10 22:00:54	timeturner	exactly what I needed :)
2013-01-10 22:00:58	timeturner	thanks
2013-01-10 22:01:31	deedubs	no problem. I haven't tested it extensively . It's what I use with angular though for now
2013-01-10 22:02:22	timeturner	I love how lean things get on the server when you render the actual page content on the client
2013-01-10 22:02:32	timeturner	server is literally just a rest service now
2013-01-10 22:03:00	timeturner	takes in ajax requests and broadcasts out to other users via websockets

2013-01-10 22:10:33	timeturner	that's the only problem
2013-01-10 22:11:05	timeturner	but the login/signup pages are rendered on the server for the most part anyways

2013-01-13 00:44:34	Lideln	Did someone already got the req.body variables "stack" ?
2013-01-13 00:46:39	--	runningskull is now known as zz_runningskull
2013-01-13 00:47:05	danielsv	did someone take your req.body?
2013-01-13 00:48:14	Lideln	Take ?
2013-01-13 00:48:59	Lideln	In fact the first time I submit in ajax, it works like a charm
2013-01-13 00:49:18	danielsv	i dont understand your question
2013-01-13 00:49:22	Lideln	But the second time (without killing the node.js app), the req.body values are doubled
2013-01-13 00:49:29	danielsv	ah
2013-01-13 00:49:39	Lideln	First time, req.body.address = '63 Rue de la Santé, 75013 Paris, France'

2013-01-13 00:50:36	Lideln	I also get plenty of "Can't set headers after they are sent." errors, and the request handler seems to be called twice
2013-01-13 00:50:51	danielsv	how is your ajax set up?
2013-01-13 00:50:57	Lideln	I get twice "POST /configuration/site/enregistrer 200 11ms - 438" for the same ajax request
2013-01-13 00:51:11	Lideln	It's a standard jquery $.post

2013-01-13 00:51:55	danielsv	is it doubled from the client side?
2013-01-13 00:52:15	Lideln	No it's not, I can see it in the Firebug network monitoring
2013-01-13 00:52:38	Lideln	I get a single Ajax POST request, but node.js (or express) seems to handle two identical http requests
2013-01-13 00:53:19	danielsv	what does the post handler look like?
2013-01-13 00:53:21	danielsv	server side
2013-01-13 00:54:20	Lideln	I can give you a link to my Stack Overflow forum post ?
2013-01-13 00:54:25	danielsv	sure
2013-01-13 00:54:36	danielsv	you could have started with that :P

2013-01-13 00:55:03	Lideln	Sorry didn't want to bother you with a long post
2013-01-13 00:55:09	Lideln	(I see I got an answer meanwhile)
2013-01-13 00:55:59	danielsv	i expected the same
2013-01-13 00:56:19	danielsv	your try setting up your post handler as he says
2013-01-13 00:56:26	danielsv	-your
2013-01-13 00:56:31	Lideln	I do it
2013-01-13 00:56:43	Lideln	But I set up the post and get handler to the same func
2013-01-13 00:57:36	Lideln		app.get('/configuration/site/modifier/:id', controller.sites_edit);
2013-01-13 00:57:36	Lideln		app.post('/configuration/site/enregistrer', controller.sites_edit);
2013-01-13 00:57:46	Lideln	And I differentiate using req.route.method
2013-01-13 00:58:47	Lideln	(actually I don't use the GET part of that function anymore, I was using it for a popup, but I'm doing it another way now)
2013-01-13 00:58:54	danielsv	have you tried simplifying the problem?
2013-01-13 00:59:00	danielsv	remove the GET part
2013-01-13 00:59:31	danielsv	only use app.post
2013-01-13 00:59:46	Lideln	http://pastebin.com/NJAgUnW3
2013-01-13 01:00:05	Lideln	Ok I don't mind doing it, please give me a sec
2013-01-13 01:01:26	Lideln	Same error
2013-01-13 01:01:41	danielsv	pastebin the new code?
2013-01-13 01:01:47	Lideln	I removed all the GET handling code in the function, and removed the 2 routes using GET for that function
2013-01-13 01:02:15	Lideln	http://pastebin.com/SsEZxuVH
2013-01-13 01:02:34	Lideln	(I slightly changed the function name, but I reflected the change in my router, don't worry)
2013-01-13 01:04:11	Lideln	I don't know if it's related, but when I GET my listing page, I get a "warning: possible EventEmitter memory leak detected. 11 listeners added." error
2013-01-13 01:05:28	Lideln	Actually it's weird: using ajax I GET the document data first, before modifying and POSTing it
2013-01-13 01:05:38	Lideln	And it goes well
2013-01-13 01:06:23	Lideln	But after POSTing the data, if I ever GET it again, I receive a lot of "Error: Can't set headers after they are sent.", and 2 GET requests in express.
2013-01-13 01:08:55	danielsv	gimme a sec, trying to help someone else too
2013-01-13 01:09:05	Lideln	Yes sure!
2013-01-13 01:11:44	danielsv	there is a lot of code, and you do many things i would have done differently
2013-01-13 01:11:48	danielsv	not saying it is wrong
2013-01-13 01:11:58	danielsv	in your app.post

2013-01-13 01:28:18	Lideln	So that you know, Line 9 of the pastebin only appears when I POST a second time using ajax. Otherwise it "stays" at Line 8.

2013-01-13 01:29:43	danielsv	try adding res.end()

2013-01-13 01:37:46	Lideln	Okay, thank you for your time Daniel
2013-01-13 01:37:55	danielsv	you just want to end up with a situation where your ajax post isnt received twice on the server
2013-01-13 01:37:59	Lideln	I'll try that later
2013-01-13 01:38:09	Lideln	Yes that part is weird
2013-01-13 01:38:26	danielsv	maybe even start a new project where you just $.post to a app.post
2013-01-13 01:38:42	Lideln	:'( Ok I will
2013-01-13 01:38:51	danielsv	not delete the old one :P

2013-01-13 01:40:28	Lideln	Thank you for your help Daniel
2013-01-13 01:40:36	Lideln	I'll try to update my Stack Overflow post
2013-01-13 01:40:40	danielsv	no problem
2013-01-13 01:41:07	danielsv	there is another stack overflow post where the guy has some duplicated headers
2013-01-13 01:41:57	danielsv	so i think there is something else in your code that writes headers in your app.post
2013-01-13 01:42:40	Lideln	But why doesn't it write the first time? It's so weird

2013-01-13 01:44:00	danielsv	it shouldnt really be a problem with ajax

2013-01-13 20:11:56	manuelbieh	ok. still dont get the partials working. seems as if hbs wants me to register every partial explicitly
2013-01-13 20:12:41	manuelbieh	consolidate.handlebars provides the possibility to load partials from files when specifying a {partials: {}} object
2013-01-13 20:13:00	defunctzombie	manuelbieh: we don't really do partials in handlebars
2013-01-13 20:13:06	defunctzombie	you are welcome to open an issue for it
2013-01-13 20:13:20	manuelbieh	is there a way to get hbs load partials automatically?!
2013-01-13 20:13:25	defunctzombie	but partials are not a really a feature of handlebars since you need to know where to load the partial
2013-01-13 20:13:34	defunctzombie	yea, you could write it in
2013-01-13 20:13:47	defunctzombie	I don't use partials so the support is probably lacking in that area
2013-01-13 20:14:16	manuelbieh	i like the idea of partials
2013-01-13 20:14:27	manuelbieh	and i like how consolidate handles them
2013-01-13 20:14:47	defunctzombie	depends what your use case is, so sure, go for it
2013-01-13 20:15:05	defunctzombie	after my initial page loads
2013-01-13 20:15:11	defunctzombie	I don't grab html from the server
2013-01-13 20:15:13	defunctzombie	I use apis
2013-01-13 20:15:15	manuelbieh	res.render("index", {partials: {head: 'head'}}) and {{> head}} is replaced by the content of views/head.html :)
2013-01-13 20:15:42	defunctzombie	what are you trying to accomplish with that?
2013-01-13 20:15:59	defunctzombie	have a separate head file for different views?
2013-01-13 20:16:11	defunctzombie	to have separate css or something?
2013-01-13 20:16:31	manuelbieh	no. have something like a "default" head included in different files
2013-01-13 20:17:37	manuelbieh	for example i have a signup.html with a signup form and i have a forgotpass.html with another form. and they both have {{> head}} at the beginning
2013-01-13 20:17:57	defunctzombie	why?
2013-01-13 20:18:02	defunctzombie	why not just make a layout for them
2013-01-13 20:18:06	defunctzombie	and use that layout
2013-01-13 20:18:27	defunctzombie	and then the particular view body will go into the layout
2013-01-13 20:18:33	defunctzombie	if you have a common layout for such things
2013-01-13 20:18:47	manuelbieh	i'm pretty new to express. i've read the support for layouts was dropped in express 3
2013-01-13 20:19:20	defunctzombie	it was dropped from express but not from hbs
2013-01-13 20:19:25	defunctzombie	it was left up to the view engine to do it
2013-01-13 20:19:31	defunctzombie	hbs supports layouts
2013-01-13 20:19:35	manuelbieh	i'd love to use layouts for that. would make my life much easier. but i just dont know how
2013-01-13 20:19:35	defunctzombie	jade does things differently
2013-01-13 20:19:44	defunctzombie	and other template engines do it even differently
2013-01-13 20:19:53	manuelbieh	ah okay. got it.
2013-01-13 20:20:08	manuelbieh	makes sense to leave it to the engine
2013-01-13 20:20:11	defunctzombie	yes
2013-01-13 20:20:17	defunctzombie	that is why it was dropped from express
2013-01-13 20:20:22	defunctzombie	express has nothing to do with it
2013-01-13 20:21:18	manuelbieh	and where can i find some documentation on how to use layouts in hbs? the readme is quite minimal
2013-01-13 20:21:36	defunctzombie	manuelbieh: yea, I should probably add that to the readme heh
2013-01-13 20:21:45	manuelbieh	hehe
2013-01-13 20:22:16	defunctzombie	look at the extend example
2013-01-13 20:22:22	defunctzombie	and ignore the #block stuff
2013-01-13 20:22:27	manuelbieh	in case i find out how to use them one day ... ;)
2013-01-13 20:22:39	defunctzombie	basically, if there is a a layout file
2013-01-13 20:22:42	defunctzombie	it will be loaded
2013-01-13 20:22:56	defunctzombie	you can turn layouts off globally with view options {layout: false}
2013-01-13 20:23:16	defunctzombie	and you can specify a particular layout when rendering with render('index', { layout: 'name.html' });
2013-01-13 20:23:20	defunctzombie	that is the gist of it
2013-01-13 20:23:25	manuelbieh	by "layout file" you mean a file which is called "layout", correct?
2013-01-13 20:23:39	defunctzombie	yes
2013-01-13 20:23:43	defunctzombie	it could be called anything tho
2013-01-13 20:23:47	defunctzombie	default looks for layout
2013-01-13 20:23:54	defunctzombie	but you can set view option layout: 'any name here'
2013-01-13 20:24:20	defunctzombie	by default hbs will use layout if the file is available and not use it if not found
2013-01-13 20:24:30	defunctzombie	beyond that you can customize what you really want to happen
2013-01-13 20:25:26	manuelbieh	https://github.com/donpark/hbs/blob/master/examples/extend/views/layout.hbs
2013-01-13 20:25:30	manuelbieh	{{title}} ...
2013-01-13 20:25:48	manuelbieh	works the same way as in consolidate? res.render('index', {title: 'foo'}) ?
2013-01-13 20:26:22	manuelbieh	and "body" is some sort of "constant" where the content of my template goes?

2013-01-13 20:29:12	defunctzombie	is the way views are rendered in express

2013-01-13 20:33:05	manuelbieh	is there a way to call these functions from within a template to translate strings?

2013-01-13 20:33:13	manuelbieh	{{__i 'mystring}} or something

2013-01-14 02:08:11	vincentmac	Quick question. I'm trying to work around IE's lack of CORS support by proxying what would be CORS requests through my node app.  I'm using express to resolve my routes and have figured out what i need on the front end for this to work. How can I make a request to another domain and pass that response to the client?
2013-01-14 02:09:37	aandy	have your app perform the request, read the response body and pass that on to the intial request
2013-01-14 02:10:51	aandy	USER -> your app ----------------------------.
2013-01-14 02:10:54	aandy	                                             |
2013-01-14 02:10:57	aandy	USER <- your app <- CORS dependent request <-'
2013-01-14 02:11:10	davidbanham	vincentmac: Here's a CORS-adding proxy I built a little while ago. Might be useful as a template - https://gist.github.com/4527102
2013-01-14 02:11:58	aandy	written in coffeescript in case you're wondering :)

2013-01-14 02:13:29	davidbanham	Oh yeah, in coffee :) Let me know if you want it compiled to JS.
2013-01-14 02:13:48	vincentmac	thanks.  looks like I'll have to compile that really quickly.
2013-01-14 02:14:01	danielsv	http://js2coffee.org/
2013-01-14 02:14:15	danielsv	it does the reverse also
2013-01-14 02:14:25	aandy	davidbanham: how do you like coffee btw? i use it fairly often, but wondering if other people actually use it (in production)
2013-01-14 02:14:38	vincentmac	nice. thanks.  you brought that link up faster than i could find it in my bookmarks
2013-01-14 02:14:43	aandy	or just coffee-script.org will convert inline
2013-01-14 02:14:46	davidbanham	vincentmac: Here it is in JS - https://gist.github.com/4527102
2013-01-14 02:15:42	davidbanham	aandy: I hated it at first, but I hired 3 guys (ex/current Rubyists) who all loved it so I persevered. Absolutely love it now and 100% of things we create in production are now in coffee.
2013-01-14 02:15:56	danielsv	it feels silly going back to js
2013-01-14 02:16:05	davidbanham	Also, pretty much any time we touch an old piece of code we just js2coffee it.
2013-01-14 02:16:05	aandy	davidbanham: sweet

2013-01-14 02:16:37	aandy	ah ok, i don't do that yet (for dependencies/libs/3rd party modules)
2013-01-14 02:16:44	aandy	but where it's applicable, sure
2013-01-14 02:17:26	aandy	i have an emscripten module - no amount of cs will ever make that human readable
2013-01-14 02:17:29	aandy	;)
2013-01-14 02:17:54	aandy	i did write a few wrappers to make it useful though
2013-01-14 02:18:04	davidbanham	aandy: Yeah I do still write one side-project in JS since it feels like it makes sense, but I'm pretty close to converting it. My favouritest thing at the moment is this - https://gist.github.com/4527127
2013-01-14 02:18:51	aandy	oh yeah. i recently discovered i didn't even need to do that in express
2013-01-14 02:18:55	aandy	(well in general)
2013-01-14 02:19:15	aandy	i just require .coffee extensions, even without requiring the coffee-script module
2013-01-14 02:19:24	davidbanham	Yeah for stuff we deploy on a VM we just coffee app.coffee, but that's super useful for deploying on PAAS environments like Azure.
2013-01-14 02:19:25	danielsv	davidbanham: what about jade and stylus for production? im trying to convince my employer that writing full html is a waste of time
2013-01-14 02:19:28	aandy	but that might be due to coffee-script being installed globally, i'm not sure
2013-01-14 02:19:42	vincentmac	davidbanham Nice.  I think I figured out what part i need from your code.  I need to pipe the proxyed response back the the main response.
2013-01-14 02:20:02	davidbanham	danielsv: I don't use Stylus since I'm allergic to any kind of styling, but all of our HTML is in Jade.
2013-01-14 02:20:13	danielsv	he complains about too much overhead
2013-01-14 02:20:20	davidbanham	vincentmac: Yeah, piping one stream into another stream is the greatest thing ever. You feel like a mad scientist every time.
2013-01-14 02:20:27	aandy	danielsv: ugh.. i have to say.. jade is not *always* easier/faster/more readable than html
2013-01-14 02:20:34	aandy	danielsv: what, too much overhead in jade?
2013-01-14 02:20:58	danielsv	the team consists of a few oldies
2013-01-14 02:21:04	aandy	davidbanham: yeah, feels like air traffic controller done right ;)
2013-01-14 02:21:14	vincentmac	I haven't had a chance to play with streams and pipes much.  Have you seen @substack's presentation on streams?

2013-01-14 02:22:09	danielsv	aandy: it just takes less time to write
2013-01-14 02:22:21	danielsv	you can say the same about coffeescript
2013-01-14 02:22:26	danielsv	its not always more readable
2013-01-14 02:23:02	davidbanham	danielsv: You do occasionally get bitten by some weirdness, but the absolute worst that can happen is you bail out to inline HTML.
2013-01-14 02:23:05	aandy	maybe i'm just not that used to jade yet, because for me there are still some elements that take more time to write than in html

2013-01-14 02:24:23	davidbanham	Muahahahahahahaha!
2013-01-14 02:24:43	aandy	that's a lotta code right there
2013-01-14 02:25:06	aandy	but still i think you could optimize it 50% by removing line 1
2013-01-14 02:25:07	aandy	:p
2013-01-14 02:25:46	aandy	but sure, you lose the .js compatability then, i guess

2013-01-14 18:06:42	Pickels	jvanveen: it depends on the view engine. I don't know any that supports multiple root directories.
2013-01-14 18:07:05	Pickels	jvanveen: what you can do is use sub apps since they can all have their own settings.

2013-01-14 20:26:17	Lideln	I created a tiny app to reproduce the bug in a quite simple environment, but unfortunately it works fine
2013-01-14 20:26:33	Lideln	I think it may be a module I am using, that messes up with req.body
2013-01-14 20:26:57	Lideln	Because even if I don't do anything but console.log(req.body); res.send('ok'); it still bugs

2013-01-14 20:38:27	defunctzombie	well, jquery file upload sounds like a reasonable contender
2013-01-14 20:38:41	defunctzombie	I would add some debug statements (console log or whatever)
2013-01-14 20:38:51	defunctzombie	at various points in your middleware stack

2013-01-15 10:40:07	jvanveen	wonder if this is going to be accepted as a pull request
2013-01-15 10:40:57	Pickels	does this work on the template level also?
2013-01-15 10:41:02	Pickels	or only for app.render?
2013-01-15 10:41:15	Pickels	for example in jade you have mixins which are found by path also
2013-01-15 10:41:39	jvanveen	ehm, not sure. i have some partials within mmm that are loaded now
2013-01-15 10:42:26	jvanveen	if it uses lookup, it should work yes
2013-01-15 10:43:39	jvanveen	what documentation generator does express use?
2013-01-15 10:43:55	jvanveen	@param {String} could be @param {String, Array} or?
2013-01-15 10:44:35	Pickels	it's the google one I think
2013-01-15 10:44:36	jvanveen	ow ehm never mind. path is always a string
2013-01-15 10:44:40	jvanveen	jsdoc?
2013-01-15 10:44:49	jvanveen	this.root is set at some earlier point
2013-01-15 10:45:07	jvanveen	its a bit confusing, path always seems to be only the template name, and not a path
2013-01-15 10:45:54	Pickels	probably because app.render can take a relative path from the root of the template dir or a absolute path
2013-01-15 10:46:10	Pickels	with absolute your template dir is ignored
2013-01-15 10:47:38	jvanveen	aah ok
2013-01-15 10:49:00	jvanveen	ill send in a pull request and see what else needs to be done first :)

2013-01-16 22:46:36	CoverSlide	for example if you're using the history api, you may render the results of a page on the serverside when first landed, then the remaining stuff can be rendered clientside

2013-01-17 01:00:30	freeBilly	hello
2013-01-17 01:00:33	freeBilly	hola
2013-01-17 01:01:05	freeBilly	how do you suggest keeping workflow data within an express application?
2013-01-17 01:01:24	freeBilly	for example, if I'm amazon and I'm selling a product
2013-01-17 01:01:46	freeBilly	a user selects the product, it goes into a cart, then the user pays
2013-01-17 01:02:04	freeBilly	is all this information saved in the session? in the DB?
2013-01-17 01:02:49	freeBilly	like, would I "transfer" the data between the stages via a combination of URL params, hidden inputs, and some DB work?
2013-01-17 01:03:42	freeBilly	what I'm struggling with is this:
2013-01-17 01:04:06	freeBilly	the user must enter his/her address
2013-01-17 01:04:10	freeBilly	but also the CC info
2013-01-17 01:04:20	freeBilly	and those are done on different screens
2013-01-17 01:04:28	freeBilly	so I put all this info in the DB
2013-01-17 01:04:52	freeBilly	but a user may be involved in different purchases at the same time
2013-01-17 01:05:10	freeBilly	so do I push the purchase ID to the CC page as a hidden field?

2013-01-18 01:51:44	aandy	manuelbieh: sure, but that's not regex
2013-01-18 01:52:46	aandy	app.all(/\/user(.*)/, ...); is regex. new RegExp('/user(.*)') is regex
2013-01-18 01:53:20	aandy	and '/user' as a string should match what you tried to type out by default in express
2013-01-18 01:53:35	aandy	although without grouping obviously
2013-01-18 01:54:50	manuelbieh	ah ok. so all() works with RegExp object as first parameter, yes?

2013-01-18 01:55:44	manuelbieh	i thought it might work with regular expressions in strings as well
2013-01-18 01:56:24	manuelbieh	app.all('/user/*') also works. and so i thought app.all('/user/(.*)') might work too ;)

2013-01-18 21:04:20	jmar777	somehow ended up on https://github.com/visionmedia/commander instead of https://github.com/visionmedia/commander.js. so confused....
2013-01-18 21:04:35	@tjholowaychuk	hahaha
2013-01-18 21:04:37	@tjholowaychuk	there's a C one too
2013-01-18 21:05:17	jmar777	getting ready to put out a blogpost on using commander here in a bit
2013-01-18 21:06:02	jmar777	had a quick question though.... i've got all my commands registered with `program.command(...)`. wanted to dump the help text if it's invoked without a command argument though
2013-01-18 21:06:15	jmar777	do i need to check the argv array, or is there a more idiomatic "commander way" of doing that?
2013-01-18 21:06:54	@tjholowaychuk	I just add that manually

2013-01-21 16:46:32	Pickels	like flash messages
2013-01-21 16:47:05	jimmyK	so do res.redirect('back') and the next line req.session = null kind of deal?

2013-01-25 15:42:28	emser	The problem is that I'm forking a child process to do image rescaling, and that process also updates the database with new image information. When I then try (from the parent process) to get the image from the database I get stale information
2013-01-25 15:42:51	emser	A bit frustrating :)
2013-01-25 15:43:01	Pickels	you sure cache is off?
