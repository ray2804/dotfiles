2012-12-22 21:13:38	nils_2	a "hook" will look and wait for a special action
2012-12-22 21:15:11	nils_2	for example. you can hook_signal("buffer_closed"). This hook will wait for a buffer to be closed
2012-12-22 21:16:06	nils_2	the author of script can now jump into a routine to do something, when a buffer is closed
2012-12-22 21:16:11	kumul	thanks :)
2012-12-22 21:16:17	nils_2	np
2012-12-22 21:16:41	kumul	im reading the docs, it doesnt mention what a hook actually is anywhere, just how to use (which should probably give it away)
2012-12-22 21:17:31	nils_2	a hook() is a computer term. this is not only for weechat
2012-12-22 21:25:37	nils_2	here is a hook() structure from 1990 (AmigaOS) ;-) -> http://amigadev.elowar.com/read/ADCD_2.1/Includes_and_Autodocs_2._guide/node012D.html

2012-12-27 22:30:40	linopolus	huh, does this theme page exist for a long time? in my memories weechat has no theme system..
2012-12-27 22:31:28	Nei	it has no theme system, the themes page & script only automate setting a lot of color options
2012-12-27 22:31:52	linopolus	ah,  ok

2012-12-27 22:46:25	StarWeaver	Solarized?

2012-12-27 22:48:36	cirrus_minor	that might help
2012-12-27 22:49:14	cirrus_minor	usually all autoload folders with plugins in there would load , not so much now since update
2012-12-27 22:49:34	StarWeaver	cirrus_minor, how did you update?

2012-12-27 22:50:18	StarWeaver	I had trouble giving my shell admin a linke to weechat-curses.deb which didn't update the plugins or anything, I think you need weechat-all or weechat-core?
2012-12-27 22:50:28	grawity	StarWeaver: Arch doesn't split packages like that.
2012-12-27 22:50:39	StarWeaver	O.o

2012-12-27 23:09:11	cirrus_minor	bcoz it wasnt workin
2012-12-27 23:09:17	cirrus_minor	i dumped em in both

2012-12-27 23:09:38	cirrus_minor	ok

2012-12-27 23:09:49	cirrus_minor	thanks dude

2012-12-27 23:11:18	StarWeaver	Then you can use /script to check that they're up to date later
2012-12-27 23:11:28	StarWeaver	/script will grab them from the internets for you

2012-12-28 09:45:12	StarWeaver	Umm, you could try making a new bar that has items of "[buffers]<newline>[nicklist]"
2012-12-28 09:45:27	StarWeaver	Or whatever the contents fo the bars you want to combine are
2012-12-28 09:45:30	StarWeaver	not sure if will work

2012-12-28 20:52:43	Trashlord	er, how are you*
2012-12-28 20:53:11	Pistos	With whatever's in the INSTALL file.
2012-12-28 20:53:14	Pistos	cmake, etc.
2012-12-28 20:53:17	StarWeaver	Well, I haven't tried it before, but i'd check for flags for ./configure along the lines of --without-python, if it's like other prgrams i've made

2012-12-28 20:53:50	Pistos	but it's failing on Python, so if I can get th compile process to ignore Python,
2012-12-28 20:53:53	Pistos	then I can just move along.
2012-12-28 20:53:54	pmo	all mac users should use that :)

2012-12-31 00:39:39	cewood	R1cochet: thanks, is that that using the layout feature?

2012-12-31 00:43:42	R1cochet	sorry
2012-12-31 00:46:07	cewood	R1cochet: nw, thanks for the help
2012-12-31 00:46:24	R1cochet	were u able to find it?
2012-12-31 00:47:24	cewood	not yet, i had already looked under the buffers.look.* options, was it likely a core setting?
2012-12-31 00:47:37	R1cochet	yea i checked buffers.look also
2012-12-31 00:47:40	R1cochet	maybe core
2012-12-31 00:48:55	R1cochet	aww found it
2012-12-31 00:49:01	R1cochet	irc.look.new_channel_position = near_server
2012-12-31 00:49:22	R1cochet	will only work if servers are not merged
2012-12-31 00:49:29	R1cochet	enjoy
2012-12-31 00:49:34	cewood	you beauty, thanks for that
2012-12-31 00:49:41	R1cochet	and u will have to either manually change buffer orders
2012-12-31 00:49:46	R1cochet	or clear layout and restart
2012-12-31 00:49:51	cewood	hadn't found it yet, cheers
2012-12-31 00:49:57	cewood	good to know
2012-12-31 00:50:00	R1cochet	you can use mouse to drag and drop in buffers bar

2012-12-31 00:52:47	cewood	is there anything besides a /mouse enable that you need configured to do the drag and drop?
2012-12-31 00:53:03	cewood	i've only been able to select with mouse, not drag/reorder
2012-12-31 00:53:32	R1cochet	hmm thats weird
2012-12-31 00:53:43	R1cochet	you should be able to just drag it to location
2012-12-31 00:54:04	R1cochet	well you can always /buffer move +/-#
2012-12-31 00:54:10	R1cochet	or /buffer move #
2012-12-31 00:54:42	cewood	ill keep experimenting with it then, i've only just started using Weechat, and i've also recently started using i3 for my WM, so could be a side effect
2012-12-31 00:54:46	cewood	thanks for your help
2012-12-31 00:55:03	R1cochet	cewood: what version of weechat and what version of buffers.pl?
2012-12-31 00:55:31	R1cochet	i could be wrong. i thought one could drag n drop buffers in the bar
2012-12-31 00:55:50	R1cochet	cewood: i would make sure ur running latest version of weechat 0.3.9.2
2012-12-31 00:56:14	cewood	WeeChat 0.3.9.2 [compiled on Dec  2 2012 17:56:41]
2012-12-31 00:56:21	R1cochet	kk
2012-12-31 00:56:32	R1cochet	did you install buffers w/ /script command?
2012-12-31 00:56:44	R1cochet	or dl direct from weechat.org
2012-12-31 00:57:24	cewood	i used weeget
2012-12-31 00:58:02	R1cochet	weeget is deprecated
2012-12-31 00:58:04	R1cochet	now
2012-12-31 00:58:11	R1cochet	u can remove it, and i suggest you do
2012-12-31 00:58:18	cewood	thanks, will do
2012-12-31 00:58:22	R1cochet	i would also remove buffers.pl if you dl'd with weeget
2012-12-31 00:58:24	sugardeath	you're right, R1cochet , drag and drop just works.  but it doesnt' actively update the position of the buffer until you let go of the mouse
2012-12-31 00:58:27	R1cochet	then just use /script
2012-12-31 00:58:41	R1cochet	sugardeath: aww ok. thank you :)
2012-12-31 00:58:49	cewood	just realised when i did the /script list
2012-12-31 00:58:58	R1cochet	i dont use mouse in weechat. so kind of hard for me to debug that
2012-12-31 00:59:09	R1cochet	cewood: /script is awesome :)
2012-12-31 00:59:23	sugardeath	yeah, it's kind of weird at first, but just click and drag and then move the mouse to where you want it to go and let go.  it'll move
2012-12-31 00:59:43	R1cochet	sugardeath: oh, so it doesnt update in real time
2012-12-31 00:59:44	cewood	LOL!
2012-12-31 00:59:46	R1cochet	gotcha
2012-12-31 00:59:57	cewood	quite true, didn't expect that behaviour
2012-12-31 01:00:02	sugardeath	right, that's a better way to describe it R1cochet =P
2012-12-31 01:00:16	cewood	works as expected, thanks for the help
2012-12-31 01:00:17	R1cochet	ty sugardeath
2012-12-31 01:00:40	cewood	that might have caused me some trouble trying to work out
2012-12-31 01:00:54	sugardeath	i think i figured it out on accident
2012-12-31 01:01:01	sugardeath	tried to click on a buffer, but accidentally moved the mouse too far
2012-12-31 01:02:24	cewood	R1cochet: I do like /script, seems quite logical
2012-12-31 01:02:51	cewood	its also refreshing that its part of the core now, very handy feature!
2012-12-31 01:07:54	R1cochet	yep
2012-12-31 01:08:06	R1cochet	sole reason i updated to 0.3.9 :)
2012-12-31 01:10:32	cewood	time well spent then :)

2012-12-31 01:20:12	R1cochet	[k]: close the server buffer

2012-12-31 17:08:15	nyuszika7h	it just ran out of memory and lost a lot of customization.

2012-12-31 17:13:18	@FlashCode	nyuszika7h: you can do some autosave with cron.py script
2012-12-31 17:14:14	Mkaysi	Usually autosaves are done automatically and by default
2012-12-31 17:15:50	nyuszika7h	Mkaysi: huh?
2012-12-31 17:15:58	nyuszika7h	Mkaysi: no, weechat only saves on /quit afaik
2012-12-31 17:16:02	nyuszika7h	and /save
2012-12-31 17:16:16	Mkaysi	I meant usually in other applications than WeeChat
2012-12-31 17:16:59	@FlashCode	the save on /quit is a sort of autosave though
2012-12-31 17:17:25	nyuszika7h	FlashCode: I can't seem to figure out how to run something every x minutes with cron.py
2012-12-31 17:17:28	nyuszika7h	*/15 * * * * doesn't work
2012-12-31 17:17:31	@FlashCode	writing the config file each time you change an option is what you want? (it seems bad for performance for me)
2012-12-31 17:18:08	nyuszika7h	no, maybe some kind of timed autosave
2012-12-31 17:18:50	nyuszika7h	something like /set weechat.something.autosave_interval 300
2012-12-31 17:18:59	nyuszika7h	or maybe make it take minutes instead
2012-12-31 17:19:06	nyuszika7h	saving every second is overkil
2012-12-31 17:19:08	nyuszika7h	l
2012-12-31 17:20:40	@FlashCode	there was a script to do exactly that, but now you can do it with cron.py
2012-12-31 17:20:58	@FlashCode	http://weechat.org/files/scripts/unofficial/config_autosave.pl
2012-12-31 17:21:30	Mkaysi	How about minutes after ending modifying the config?
2012-12-31 17:21:31	@FlashCode	and anyway it's good habit to do a /save manually if you change lot of settings :)
2012-12-31 17:21:44	@FlashCode	(for weechat or any software)

2012-12-31 17:22:50	Mkaysi	Where do you type /save with graphical programs? :P
2012-12-31 17:23:20	@FlashCode	I'm not for a periodic auto save of files, because it can disturb things (for example if user wants to reload config file)
2012-12-31 17:23:58	Mkaysi	Supybot saves by default sometimes, but has option to turn it off
2012-12-31 17:29:35	monty	is it possible to do some actions (msg, part) when closing the terminal? (while weechat shall run under screen)
2012-12-31 17:31:26	grawity	Speaking of which, can I hide the "Options saved...." messages from my status buffer?
2012-12-31 17:31:33	grawity	/filter doesn't work
2012-12-31 17:31:35	nyuszika7h	grawity: /filter?
2012-12-31 17:31:36	nyuszika7h	oh
2012-12-31 17:32:18	nyuszika7h	grawity: /filter add save core.weechat * ^Options saved
2012-12-31 17:32:20	nyuszika7h	that works for me
2012-12-31 17:32:27	grawity	oh, it's core.weechat?
2012-12-31 17:32:36	nyuszika7h	yes
2012-12-31 17:32:36	grawity	will try that... I was trying just 'weechat'
2012-12-31 17:33:12	grawity	Works, thanks
2012-12-31 17:33:43	nyuszika7h	yw :)

2013-01-01 00:18:00	kakashiAL	let me try it
2013-01-01 00:19:20	Kunsi	also, mostly depends on irc network if idle time is sent in "normal" whois reply, or not
2013-01-01 00:19:21	kakashiAL	thx Kunsi, it works :)
2013-01-01 00:19:35	Kunsi	if not, double nickname
2013-01-01 00:20:19	kakashiAL	well, the most important thing for me is to know how long he is afk :)
2013-01-01 00:20:22	grawity	Kunsi: idle time is never sent in "normal" replies
2013-01-01 00:20:31	grawity	Kunsi: unless you both are on the same server
2013-01-01 00:21:24	Kunsi	grawity: some irc networks actually do send idle time whenever you're on same server or not
2013-01-01 00:24:39	dominikh	for example?

2013-01-01 13:04:00	R1cochet	so if i go to clear a buffer, then switch before clearing then come back to that buffer and clear again, i end up sending "/c/c" to the channel.
2013-01-01 13:05:20	Nei	thats probably a feature
2013-01-01 13:05:38	xt	/c/c
2013-01-01 13:06:07	@FlashCode	/a/b is considered as a path/file, not a command
2013-01-01 13:06:22	R1cochet	aww ok
2013-01-01 13:06:31	R1cochet	but should this be sent as a privmsg?
2013-01-01 13:06:47	@FlashCode	anything that is not a command is a "normal" message
2013-01-01 13:06:54	@FlashCode	and then sent as privmsg on an irc buffer (channel)
2013-01-01 13:07:28	R1cochet	but if i type an incorrect command it does not get sent as a privmsg
2013-01-01 13:07:46	nils_2	it depends on the command char
2013-01-01 13:07:49	R1cochet	/nocommand
2013-01-01 13:08:04	Nei	if you want send filename you dont need to escape it
2013-01-01 13:08:37	nils_2	/set weechat.look.command_chars
2013-01-01 13:08:46	nils_2	/ < is the standard command char
2013-01-01 13:08:50	R1cochet	correct
2013-01-01 13:08:53	R1cochet	thats what im used to

2013-01-01 13:09:26	nils_2	i don't understand the problem R1cochet :-(
2013-01-01 13:09:55	@FlashCode	R1cochet: /abcd is an incorrect command, so not sent, but /ab/cd is considered as a path, so not a command, and then sent as privmsg
2013-01-01 13:10:32	R1cochet	well, sometimes i want to clear a buffer, but i screw up flipping through buffers and dont bother to look at what is in the input bar. so i duplicate the command and it ends up getting sent as a privmsg. problem is id prefer it say incorrect command and that way people dont know im around
2013-01-01 13:10:47	R1cochet	FlashCode: understood
2013-01-01 13:11:08	@FlashCode	ok I understand your problem
2013-01-01 13:11:36	@FlashCode	then I can add an option to turn off path detection
2013-01-01 13:11:40	@FlashCode	so that /c/c will not be sent
2013-01-01 13:11:41	Nei	wh not use a keybid unstead
2013-01-01 13:11:53	nils_2	/set weechat.look.input_share
2013-01-01 13:11:53	@FlashCode	and yes, use a key for that, will be better
2013-01-01 13:12:04	R1cochet	damn u and your simple solutions
2013-01-01 13:12:05	Nei	or yse arow-down /c
2013-01-01 13:12:08	R1cochet	thank you :)
2013-01-01 13:12:20	R1cochet	good idea
2013-01-01 13:12:36	R1cochet	i was gonna do something stupid like ctrl-char
2013-01-01 13:13:55	R1cochet	hmm arrow-down might not be good. thats already bound.
2013-01-01 13:14:53	xt	ctrl-arrow-down
2013-01-01 13:15:02	@FlashCode	tip: you can bind upper case letter with meta (alt)
2013-01-01 13:15:10	@FlashCode	for example, meta-C != meta-c
2013-01-01 13:15:33	@FlashCode	meta-C = alt + shift + c
2013-01-01 13:15:57	@FlashCode	(does not work with ctrl)
2013-01-01 13:16:18	nils_2	R1cochet: you can also install unwanted_msg.py to see an error message ;-)
2013-01-01 13:16:33	R1cochet	thank you all :)

2013-01-01 18:46:00	 *	Zucca is also curious...
2013-01-01 18:46:26	@FlashCode	according to number of commits (just that, I didn't look at something else), xchat is a dead project, and hexchat is very active
2013-01-01 18:46:30	Mkaysi	hexchat has inbuild SASL support. Is it available for Linux?
2013-01-01 18:47:02	pmo	FlashCode, ah i thought hexchat was a clone of xchat
2013-01-01 18:47:12	Mkaysi	Don't worry, I couldn't move to it, because I am already depending on some features of WeeChat.
2013-01-01 18:47:20	Mkaysi	I think that Hexchat is work of Xchat
2013-01-01 18:47:32	pmo	also arent you sure those commits are theming FlashCode ?
2013-01-01 18:47:40	@FlashCode	pmo: it's a fork (if I understood well)

2013-01-01 18:48:20	Mkaysi	Oh, so that is where XChat-wdk disappeared
2013-01-01 18:48:29	pmo	i have hexchat on my laptop.. seems identical.. but just wastes your time getting it back to normal after almost every upgrade hehe
2013-01-01 18:49:02	pmo	they have done some addons tho
2013-01-01 18:49:29	pmo	(btw hexchat on windows)

2013-01-01 18:52:40	pmo	what?
2013-01-01 18:52:59	Yorokobi	It is an IRC bot, a pretty decent one, at that.
2013-01-01 18:53:30	phlux	Eh, Supybot+Limnoria is better
2013-01-01 18:53:36	phlux	And still actively developed

2013-01-01 18:56:25	phlux	I'm honestly not sure
2013-01-01 18:56:28	Mkaysi	You have "issue" to "prefer original programs"
2013-01-01 18:56:42	Mkaysi	Supybot is full  of security issues like that link says
2013-01-01 18:56:54	pmo	and how does a bot solve anything? :p
2013-01-01 18:57:14	Mkaysi	After your computer has went down sometimes because of those issues, you can move to Limnoria/Gribble and see that it doesn't crash your computer anymore
2013-01-01 18:57:32	pmo	what?
2013-01-01 18:57:56	Mkaysi	Supybot just has issues which crash the computer where it's running on
2013-01-01 18:58:56	pmo	ah i dc'ed

2013-01-02 12:16:24	@FlashCode	easier way to do it is in weechat.conf (replace meta-j by meta-m)

2013-01-02 12:16:45	@FlashCode	so you must first remove this one to bind meta-m + something else

2013-01-02 17:04:24	@FlashCode	if you undef an option irc.server.<server>.<option>, weechat will use value from irc.server_default.<option>

2013-01-02 17:04:41	rico3	Ok, understood.
2013-01-02 17:05:15	@FlashCode	so you have to set server_default option if value must be used on all servers, and a server option if it is for this server only
2013-01-02 17:05:15	rico3	Means, you can have individual quit msgs, or 1 common quit msg for ALL the server... hmm... interesting... +1 to weechat!

2013-01-02 19:47:49	Trashlord	shows a given number of lines from some channel
2013-01-02 19:47:51	Trashlord	or window, actually
2013-01-02 19:48:16	Trashlord	I think it's 1000 lines by default, not sure
2013-01-02 19:48:21	Trashlord	probably less than that
2013-01-02 19:48:32	Trashlord	anyway, I don't recall WeeChat having such a feature
2013-01-02 19:48:45	pmo	could be easy fixed with /shell and a bash script :P
2013-01-02 19:48:46	Trashlord	but there are scripts that look up logs
2013-01-02 19:49:25	wysiwtf	well theres ctrl-r
2013-01-02 19:49:53	wysiwtf	and also a grep script which workd p much like the linux tool

2013-01-02 20:50:23	nils_2	good evening
2013-01-02 20:50:44	grawity	Trashlord: /grep has an option to search the current buffer
2013-01-02 20:52:00	Exio	and ctrl-r?
2013-01-02 20:52:40	wysiwtf	the cool thing with ctrl-r is that it updates the buffer in realtime
2013-01-02 20:53:10	Gadget17	Not sure if I am being dense, but I can't find the option to add an email address (needed to connect to a private server)
2013-01-02 20:54:58	Trashlord	grawity: is it built in?
2013-01-02 20:55:07	grawity	No.

2013-01-02 20:55:24	nils_2	Gadget17: whats the email address for? as a password or username?
2013-01-02 20:55:26	grawity	the "email address" field in mIRC just sets the username
2013-01-02 20:55:31	grawity	and something else, I think

2013-01-02 21:33:14	Jonimus	Basically I have a command which asks a bot for an invite to a +i channel and I want to give it time to respond by inviting me to said channel.
2013-01-02 21:33:59	Jonimus	of if there is a better way to do this that works too.

2013-01-02 21:35:18	Jonimus	but is there a way to make it for only one channel?

2013-01-02 21:36:34	Jonimus	with mouse support re-arranging channels after a server reboot and buffers.pl works well enough
2013-01-02 21:36:51	nils_2	/layout save
2013-01-02 21:37:04	Jonimus	How did I not know about this...

2013-01-02 21:37:30	Jonimus	I've read them, but how long has that feature been there?
2013-01-02 21:37:39	StarWeaver	there's also the script autojoin_on_invite.py
2013-01-02 21:37:43	nils_2	some days :p
2013-01-02 21:38:20	StarWeaver	long as i an remember, but
2013-01-02 21:38:47	Jonimus	I don't want autojoin on invite
2013-01-02 21:38:57	Jonimus	but layout save will do what I want
2013-01-02 21:39:24	Jonimus	I might have to edit the saved layout a bit since I don't autojoin in here and a few other channels I'm in but I'll look into that later.

2013-01-02 23:07:36	 *	StarWeaver is just forgetful
2013-01-02 23:08:25	andrew12	i mean... is there a way i can send a command to a channel buffer without knowing the name of the server that channel is on?
2013-01-02 23:08:45	andrew12	i tried just doing the channel name and not network,channel but that didn't work
2013-01-02 23:09:35	R1cochet	i dont think its possible andrew12. if you were in 2 channels with the same name, how would weechat know which channel to send to?
2013-01-02 23:09:55	nils_2	you'll have to give the buffer pointer to command
2013-01-02 23:10:23	andrew12	ooooh, i could probably just do /msg channel on the current buffer
2013-01-02 23:10:59	nils_2	weechat.command(buffer, command)
2013-01-02 23:11:35	nils_2	"buffer" is the pointer of the buffer and "command" the command you want to execute
2013-01-02 23:12:04	R1cochet	andrew12: i aliased a command to send to a specific nick on a specific server. maybe you can modify it to your needs? newcommand => /msg -server <server.name> <nickname> $1
2013-01-02 23:12:39	R1cochet	nils_2: is there a -channel flag for something like that?
2013-01-02 23:12:55	R1cochet	or a list of flags one can pass in the docs somewhere?
2013-01-02 23:13:22	nils_2	channel flag for what?
2013-01-02 23:13:53	R1cochet	like the -server flag

2013-01-03 05:50:29	_`_	that's not a bad piece of documentation
2013-01-03 05:50:43	_`_	you mean they are both in buffer 0?

2013-01-03 09:11:51	@FlashCode	hmm seems ok
2013-01-03 09:12:06	@FlashCode	if you do manually: /plugin load irc

2013-01-03 09:18:48	otters`	how can I change it
2013-01-03 09:19:06	@FlashCode	to change it you must recompile weechat

2013-01-03 09:19:17	otters`	I compiled with --prefix=/usr/local
2013-01-03 09:19:18	otters`	what gives

2013-01-03 09:19:39	otters`	./configure --prefix=/usr --disable-dependency-tracking --disable-guile --disable-tcl is the exact line
2013-01-03 09:19:47	@FlashCode	are you sure your current weechat-curses running is from /usr/bin and not /usr/local/bin ?
2013-01-03 09:19:50	otters`	yes
2013-01-03 09:19:55	@FlashCode	double check please :)
2013-01-03 09:19:55	otters`	there's no weechat-curses in /usr/local/bin

2013-01-03 09:21:02	@FlashCode	and for boolean you don't need to give =on
2013-01-03 09:21:45	otters`	FlashCode: I recompiled and have the same problem
2013-01-03 09:21:48	@FlashCode	otters`: then maybe clean your files (cache for configure, ..) and recompile whole weechat
2013-01-03 09:22:00	@FlashCode	but as I said, cmake is recommended
2013-01-03 09:22:07	@FlashCode	we should fix the problem you have with cmake
2013-01-03 09:22:37	@FlashCode	unfortunately I have no way to test under Mac, proprietary OS, I can not install :p
2013-01-03 09:23:36	otters`	ok
2013-01-03 09:24:09	@FlashCode	btw why not installing weechat via homebrew?
2013-01-03 09:24:13	@FlashCode	I think it's compiled using cmake
2013-01-03 09:24:22	otters`	because that version of weechat crashes about 4 times a day
2013-01-03 09:24:28	otters`	and I can't compile debug unless I do it myself
2013-01-03 09:24:46	@FlashCode	then as I asked in your bug on savannah, enable core files and send me backtrace

2013-01-03 09:25:24	@FlashCode	it's better to fix a problem rather than trying a workaround IMHO ;)

2013-01-03 09:26:35	@FlashCode	and when you say you have crash, do you have scripts installed? (scripts can easily crash weechat by doing wrong things)
2013-01-03 09:26:56	otters`	heh, easily
2013-01-03 09:26:57	otters`	yeah, I have a few
2013-01-03 09:27:07	otters`	the only one I've installed since the problem started happening you can take a look at if you want
2013-01-03 09:27:37	@FlashCode	what's the name of script?
2013-01-03 09:27:42	otters`	I wrote it

2013-01-03 09:28:30	@FlashCode	ok, sorry no time to check the script, but try running weechat without this script
2013-01-03 09:28:35	@FlashCode	and check if you still have crashs
2013-01-03 09:29:00	@FlashCode	the crashs in weechat itself are rare
2013-01-03 09:29:22	@FlashCode	but it can of course happen too
2013-01-03 09:29:31	otters`	no I don't have crashes without the script

2013-01-03 09:30:07	@FlashCode	if you manage to compile with debug, you should see where the crash happens

2013-01-03 09:36:27	@FlashCode	you can disable timestamp in a buffer

2013-01-03 09:37:52	R1cochet	wrote a simple script for gb that inserts a blank line after each line printed. it prints a timestamp though, so i was wondering if these blank lines could be printed with no timestamp
2013-01-03 09:38:01	@FlashCode	ah
2013-01-03 09:38:02	@FlashCode	yes you can

2013-01-03 09:38:06	@FlashCode	like the day change message
2013-01-03 09:38:10	R1cochet	hmm
2013-01-03 09:38:25	@FlashCode	try: weechat.prnt(buffer, '\t\t ')
2013-01-03 09:38:38	@FlashCode	space is maybe not even needed
2013-01-03 09:38:55	@FlashCode	two tabs will disable timestamp (and break alignment)
2013-01-03 09:39:05	R1cochet	nice
2013-01-03 09:39:10	R1cochet	is this documented somewhere?
2013-01-03 09:39:56	@FlashCode	hmm I think no, I'll add that in API doc
2013-01-03 09:39:56	R1cochet	just out of curiosity
2013-01-03 09:40:01	R1cochet	cool
2013-01-03 09:40:58	R1cochet	i think i may have asked before, but are there other forms of the documentation aside from the html and the plain text files in src?
2013-01-03 09:43:49	@FlashCode	no
2013-01-03 09:44:15	@FlashCode	the next step is by reading source code :D
2013-01-03 09:44:21	@FlashCode	then you'll master WeeChat :)

2013-01-03 10:21:59	R1cochet	i edited the double lines script, no timestamp on blanklines
2013-01-03 10:22:04	R1cochet	unless you want the timestamps
2013-01-03 10:22:52	gb	no it's fine as is unless you know how to make the wrapping more intelligent :)
2013-01-03 10:23:41	gb	i spose it would be good if the blanks were without time though
2013-01-03 10:24:00	gb	is it in the repo yet?

2013-01-03 10:32:00	gb	R1cochet: is it possible to apply double to the backlog as well when the client first starts or not enough info stored to do that
2013-01-03 10:32:40	gb	at present it does not matter because the weechat client has been running for weeks
2013-01-03 10:32:58	R1cochet	i believe so. but would that throw off weechat reading the logs?
2013-01-03 10:33:39	R1cochet	and i would have to rescript
2013-01-03 10:33:54	gb	i dunno, im just thinking for if this machine gets rebooted at some stage :)
2013-01-03 10:35:49	gb	i suspended it just over a week ago before rough seas and everything recovered ok, but not so sure after a reboot :)

2013-01-03 10:43:49	gb	i unloaded and then reloaded it before
2013-01-03 10:44:15	gb	mm i wonder if i unload the script if the buffers resort to single spacing
2013-01-03 10:44:31	gb	i did not look last time
2013-01-03 10:45:28	gb	if so might be an easy way to switch spacing on and off with alt l  or alt d
2013-01-03 10:48:06	gb	hmm nope it didn't
2013-01-03 10:48:19	gb	does not matter though
2013-01-03 10:49:59	R1cochet	to reload /perl reload double_lines
2013-01-03 10:51:30	gb	ok you forgot this again version 0.1
2013-01-03 10:53:15	gb	much nicer
2013-01-03 10:54:10	gb	pity it was not able to do same as timestamp and be switched on/off but i guess that would be a complete rewrite
2013-01-03 10:57:09	R1cochet	lol yea, sorry about version number, forgot to change that again. noticed and have since changed in the source :)
2013-01-03 10:59:38	gb	haha im not fussed just thought it was funny
2013-01-03 11:00:13	gb	is it possible for it to be dynamic like the timestamp?

2013-01-03 11:02:45	R1cochet	or, i might be able to make it so you can toggle with a filter. but then you would have to turn off filters to see the blank lines.
2013-01-03 11:02:46	gb	yeah thats what i thought, just an idea though
2013-01-03 11:03:13	gb	it is much more readable though now thanks for your hard work
2013-01-03 11:03:22	R1cochet	and with the filters off, you would end up seeing the join/part/quit and whatever else you may have hidden

2013-01-03 13:49:43	xag	Sorry, I didn't see that the original patch was committed
2013-01-03 13:49:47	@FlashCode	then please just add a comment in bug
2013-01-03 13:49:52	xag	OK
2013-01-03 13:49:57	@FlashCode	and I'll change the status to "fixed"
2013-01-03 13:50:00	@FlashCode	thx for testing
2013-01-03 13:50:47	@FlashCode	you should have received a mail on Nov 30th, when I committed the patch and added a comment ;)

2013-01-03 15:52:07	grawity	I don't remember precisely – yesterday I /quit my local Weechat installation, and instead of exiting it printed something along the lines of "corruption in a linked list in “WeeChat” at <some memory address>" and froze
2013-01-03 15:52:16	grawity	but then I accidentally killed all my processes at once :(

2013-01-03 16:20:10	@FlashCode	it should not be a problem, but who knows :p
2013-01-03 16:20:35	grawity	nah, nevermind this – software crashes often on my laptop :D
2013-01-03 16:21:30	smiler	If stuff often crashes, verifying that your ram isn't broken is a good idea.
2013-01-03 16:21:34	Exio	arch crashes too often
2013-01-03 16:21:44	Exio	at least in every computer i tested it
2013-01-03 16:22:17	smiler	I shut down my arch file server for the first time in over a year when I moved before christmas.
2013-01-03 16:22:20	smiler	Stable as a rock :)
2013-01-03 16:22:32	Exio	archlinux? year?
2013-01-03 16:22:42	Exio	didn't you upgrade it? for kernel upgrades or stuff?
2013-01-03 16:22:50	smiler	All except the kernel
2013-01-03 16:23:28	grawity	smiler: nah, it's probably just me having built too many programs from Git
2013-01-03 16:24:00	smiler	But I've abanoned arch now. I can't stand systemd.
2013-01-03 16:24:12	grawity	I won't discuss that one.

2013-01-03 19:30:14	ubergeek42	if you had it plugged into a pc, you can use DDMS to get the stack trace, but thats probably too much work unless you're a developer.  If you click the report/send crash details it'll show up on my end(assuming you installed it through the market)
2013-01-03 19:30:53	ubergeek42	tab complete nicks is with the search key if you have one, or the tab key on a soft keyboard(I know the Hacker Keyboard has one, some others do as well)

2013-01-03 20:05:50	@FlashCode	if you have not same buffer in weechat and weechat-android, then it should be a bug in weechat-android

2013-01-03 20:06:27	@FlashCode	or tell me exactly what you do, I'll try to reproduce the problem

2013-01-03 20:21:24	@FlashCode	it's because weechat-android does not change the current buffer in weechat

2013-01-03 20:23:27	@FlashCode	the script should not use current_buffer() function, but the buffer received in command callback (ie the buffer where command has been executed)
2013-01-03 20:23:42	@FlashCode	let me look at script
2013-01-03 20:23:46	Zucca	I thought that too.
2013-01-03 20:23:48	@FlashCode	it's mpc.py ?
2013-01-03 20:23:52	Zucca	Yes.
2013-01-03 20:24:33	@FlashCode	yes it uses weechat.current_buffer(), that's why you have this result
2013-01-03 20:24:46	@FlashCode	the current buffer can be different from buffer where command is issued
2013-01-03 20:25:00	@FlashCode	especially with relay
2013-01-03 20:25:01	gecko	is one better than the other (perl vs python) or is it mostly preference?
2013-01-03 20:25:07	 *	Zucca tests.
2013-01-03 20:25:27	@FlashCode	Zucca: I can try to make changes in script
2013-01-03 20:26:02	Zucca	testing /shell
2013-01-03 20:26:37	Zucca	Ok. It's the script. ;-)
2013-01-03 20:26:47	@FlashCode	it works with /shell ?
2013-01-03 20:26:55	Zucca	Yes.

2013-01-03 20:31:48	@FlashCode	hmm 41 scripts are using weechat.current_buffer(), and this is often a bad idea I think

2013-01-03 20:35:08	ubergeek42	FlashCode: I've considered making it an option(switching buffers when you switch channels), but the main motivation I had was so that buffers got marked as read when looked at on the client.  It'd definitely be an option though, and not the default.
2013-01-03 20:35:13	Zucca	FlashCode: What's the (usually) right method?
2013-01-03 20:35:38	@FlashCode	Zucca: inside a command callback, use the buffer you get as argument
2013-01-03 20:35:53	@FlashCode	in other places, if you don't have the buffer, then why not using current_buffer
2013-01-03 20:36:12	@FlashCode	ubergeek42: yes, after thinking about that, I think it's not a good idea
2013-01-03 20:36:24	@FlashCode	and I realised the current problem is in the script anyway :)

2013-01-03 22:27:25	Dan39	hehe
2013-01-03 22:27:30	Dan39	nah, my fault im sure
2013-01-03 22:27:45	Dan39	buggy script code
2013-01-03 22:28:04	Dan39	weechat.prnt(weechat.current_buffer(), weechat.hdata_string(weechat.hdata_get('irc_channel'), buf, 'topic'))
2013-01-03 22:28:09	Dan39	does something look wrong with that?
2013-01-03 22:28:31	Dan39	should print the topic, of buf shouldnt it?
2013-01-03 22:29:01	Dan39	hmm or should that 2nd arg in this case not be pointer to buffer...
2013-01-03 22:29:35	Dan39	hmm pretty sure it should be
2013-01-03 22:30:33	@FlashCode	an irc_channel is not a buffer
2013-01-03 22:30:53	@FlashCode	so if you use irc_channel hdata you must give pointer to an irc channel, not buffer pointer
2013-01-03 22:31:09	Dan39	ah
2013-01-03 22:31:16	Dan39	ow do i get that
2013-01-03 22:31:22	@FlashCode	maybe easier with an infolist rather than a hdata
2013-01-03 22:31:23	@FlashCode	to get the topic
2013-01-03 22:31:28	Dan39	o really
2013-01-03 22:31:42	@FlashCode	or you can use the buffer title too
2013-01-03 22:33:05	+weebot	-git(scripts)- FlashCode: mpc.py 0.3: fix buffer used to print message (use buffer in command callback, not current buffer)
2013-01-03 22:33:55	Dan39	wow this is getting complicated for just trying to read the topic of channel <_<
2013-01-03 22:34:28	Dan39	might be easy to just send a /topcic command and then hook the reply? lol

2013-01-03 22:40:04	nils_2	Dan39: have a look at topicsed script how to get a channel topic
2013-01-03 22:41:20	Dan39	i think i might have it
2013-01-03 22:42:42	Dan39	success :D and on my own haha
2013-01-03 22:44:02	Dan39	nils_2: why do you use title instead of topic?
2013-01-03 22:44:47	nils_2	"title" is the variable name for topic.
2013-01-03 22:44:51	Dan39	i just did this and it worked good:
2013-01-03 22:44:52	Dan39	    il_pointer = weechat.infolist_get('irc_channel', '', 'myserver,mychannel')
2013-01-03 22:44:53	Dan39	    weechat.infolist_next(il_pointer)
2013-01-03 22:44:54	Dan39	    weechat.prnt(weechat.current_buffer(), weechat.infolist_string(il_pointer, 'topic'))
2013-01-03 22:45:40	Dan39	these are fields of the infolist:
2013-01-03 22:45:42	Dan39	'p:buffer,s:buffer_name,s:buffer_short_name,i:type,s:name,s:topic,s:modes,i:limit,s:key,i:names_received,i:checking_away,s:away_message,i:has_

2013-01-03 22:46:05	Dan39	hmm
2013-01-03 22:46:19	Dan39	o
2013-01-03 22:46:21	Dan39	you get buffer
2013-01-03 22:46:24	Dan39	not irc channel
2013-01-03 22:46:28	Dan39	i see
2013-01-03 22:46:55	Dan39	i wonder which way is better
2013-01-03 22:47:33	nils_2	i would say buffer. irc is not the whole world ;-)
2013-01-03 22:49:34	Dan39	yea
2013-01-03 22:50:10	nils_2	i suggest using infolist.py
2013-01-03 22:50:42	Dan39	the irc topic is always set to title tho... what about merged buffers? each has its own buffer pointer with different title?
2013-01-03 22:52:43	Dan39	hmm im surprised weechat doesnt save configuration files like hourly or something
2013-01-03 22:53:00	Dan39	i had settings i changed like 2 days ago, weechat crashed and now i lost them L|

2013-01-03 22:53:56	nils_2	for merged buffers you'll have to look which buffer is the active one

2013-01-03 22:57:58	Dan39	jeez flashcode pops out python scripts for weechat larger than programs that take me days to make <_<
2013-01-03 22:58:11	nils_2	i am using cron to frequently save my config
2013-01-03 22:59:16	R1cochet	cron is only 638 lines. sysinfo is large tho :)
2013-01-03 22:59:53	Dan39	this cron script doesnt use much cpu does it? lol

2013-01-03 23:03:08	Dan39	when getting buffer by name, its server.#channel, but server,#channel, right?
2013-01-03 23:05:10	nils_2	getting from what?
2013-01-03 23:05:21	R1cochet	lol nils_2 understood :)
2013-01-03 23:06:40	Dan39	infolist_pointer = weechat.infolist_get('buffer', '', 'myserver.#mychannel')
2013-01-03 23:06:50	Dan39	like that
2013-01-03 23:06:59	nils_2	all jokes aside. sysinfo is more "sysinfo" than weechat code
2013-01-03 23:07:17	Dan39	then i do infolist_fields and there is nothing

2013-01-03 23:17:25	Dan39	in the case of topicsed maybe you are getting info multiple times, so then you only have to search once
2013-01-03 23:17:47	Dan39	vs doing it in infolist_get i guess it runs search every time
2013-01-03 23:18:01	Dan39	i will be happy if it works
2013-01-03 23:18:20	nils_2	if you want i can have a look at script
2013-01-03 23:19:17	Dan39	?
2013-01-03 23:19:38	Dan39	no i think you were right, need to add irc.

2013-01-04 01:20:33	-->	ehlu (~ehlu@109.74.0.47) has joined #weechat
2013-01-04 01:20:40	Bubo	MrSpock: let me try
2013-01-04 01:20:41	MrSpock	Bubo: uhm is that bsd?
2013-01-04 01:20:50	Bubo	ubuntu 11.10
2013-01-04 01:21:05	MrSpock	Bubo: uncomment whatever locale you want in locale.gen and run locale-gen
2013-01-04 01:21:09	Trashlord	why not 12.10?
2013-01-04 01:21:11	MrSpock	then fix LANG etc
2013-01-04 01:21:19	MrSpock	and yes, you should upgrade
2013-01-04 01:21:34	R1cochet	unity sucks
2013-01-04 01:21:38	Bubo	I'm on a VPS
2013-01-04 01:21:56	R1cochet	y not 12.04 server??? lol jk
2013-01-04 01:22:07	Bubo	11.10 is fine
2013-01-04 01:22:15	Bubo	locale.gen? where do I find it
2013-01-04 01:22:17	MrSpock	Bubo: except that it is full of security holes
2013-01-04 01:22:27	MrSpock	Bubo: also very soon it is EOL :)
2013-01-04 01:22:41	MrSpock	it will be*
2013-01-04 01:22:47	R1cochet	its on a vps
2013-01-04 01:22:54	Bubo	MrSpock: it's fine for me really. I am not doing anything serious
2013-01-04 01:22:55	R1cochet	dont think he can change it
2013-01-04 01:23:09	MrSpock	R1cochet: all sane vps lets you run whatever you want
2013-01-04 01:23:23	Bubo	This one is insane
2013-01-04 01:23:27	Bubo	but cheap and good specs :D
2013-01-04 01:23:33	MrSpock	actually I havn't found any that doesn't allow you to run whatever you want
2013-01-04 01:24:19	MrSpock	well, except a windows only vps that I found
2013-01-04 01:24:31	Bubo	MrSpock: so how do i find this locale.gen ? Where is it?
2013-01-04 01:24:41	MrSpock	 /etc/locale.conf
2013-01-04 01:24:49	MrSpock	unless ubuntu is doing something silly
2013-01-04 01:24:53	Bubo	let me see
2013-01-04 01:24:57	MrSpock	er.. /etc/locale.gen
2013-01-04 01:25:05	MrSpock	curse you autocompletion!
2013-01-04 01:25:49	MrSpock	if it doesn't exist, ask #ubuntu about how to gen locales
2013-01-04 01:26:02	Bubo	It is there, just bank
2013-01-04 01:26:04	Bubo	blank*
2013-01-04 01:26:17	MrSpock	do you have a locale-gen command?
2013-01-04 01:26:24	Bubo	sec
2013-01-04 01:26:38	Bubo	yes
2013-01-04 01:27:02	MrSpock	try echo "en_US.UTF-8" > /etc/locale.gen && locale-gen
2013-01-04 01:27:26	Bubo	c
2013-01-04 01:27:28	Bubo	sec
2013-01-04 01:27:37	Bubo	Ok, did it
2013-01-04 01:27:45	MrSpock	did it gen the locale?
2013-01-04 01:27:55	Exio	wtf
2013-01-04 01:27:58	Exio	MrSpock: why >?
2013-01-04 01:28:04	Bubo	It didn't output anything
2013-01-04 01:28:10	MrSpock	Bubo: it should have :/
2013-01-04 01:28:14	MrSpock	check locale -a
2013-01-04 01:28:25	Exio	>> should be better
2013-01-04 01:28:39	MrSpock	Exio: last time I checked POSIX was not utf8, that is why
2013-01-04 01:28:46	Bubo	locale -a is the same
2013-01-04 01:28:51	Bubo	not changed
2013-01-04 01:28:56	Exio	i mean, '>' removes old data
2013-01-04 01:29:05	MrSpock	bha, ubuntu probably use some other file for the config then
2013-01-04 01:29:08	Bubo	Exio: the locale-gen was blank
2013-01-04 01:29:10	MrSpock	Exio: it was already empty
2013-01-04 01:29:20	Bubo	MrSpock: I'll upgrade to 12.10 I guess
2013-01-04 01:29:24	Bubo	gonna hassle it later on
2013-01-04 01:29:24	Exio	that doesn't mean anything
2013-01-04 01:29:37	Exio	what Bubo said*
2013-01-04 01:29:43	Exio	maybe it has everything commented
2013-01-04 01:29:51	Bubo	it doesn't
2013-01-04 01:29:54	Bubo	i opened it
2013-01-04 01:29:57	Bubo	blank
2013-01-04 01:30:19	MrSpock	Bubo: poke #ubuntu and ask them if they use a non-standard path for it
2013-01-04 01:30:22	MrSpock	they probably do
2013-01-04 01:30:27	Exio	Bubo: ah, k
2013-01-04 01:30:51	Bubo	MrSpock: after I upgrade..
2013-01-04 01:30:54	MrSpock	actually, just less $(which locale-gen)
2013-01-04 01:31:03	MrSpock	it should say at the top the default path
2013-01-04 01:31:18	MrSpock	LOCALEGEN=/etc/locale.gen
2013-01-04 01:31:19	MrSpock	LOCALES=/usr/share/i18n/locales
2013-01-04 01:31:21	MrSpock	or similar
2013-01-04 01:31:21	Bubo	/usr/sbin/locale.gen
2013-01-04 01:31:58	MrSpock	is that what it says for LOCALEGEN ?
2013-01-04 01:32:07	Bubo	yes
2013-01-04 01:32:21	MrSpock	ok, someone at canonical needs to be hurt badly
2013-01-04 01:32:34	Bubo	and this locale-gen file is full of stuff
2013-01-04 01:32:47	Bubo	MrSpock: could be my VPS, not ubuntu
2013-01-04 01:32:50	MrSpock	Bubo: open that in your favorite editor and uncomment en_US.UTF-8
2013-01-04 01:32:59	Bubo	and run locale-gen?
2013-01-04 01:33:02	MrSpock	yes
2013-01-04 01:33:59	Bubo	No commented lines
2013-01-04 01:34:02	Bubo	meh, just leave it
2013-01-04 01:36:11	MrSpock	en_US.UTF-8 is not commented?
2013-01-04 01:36:37	MrSpock	if so, you might be missing some package
2013-01-04 01:36:57	R1cochet	Bubo: have you checked which font packages u have installed?
2013-01-04 01:37:09	MrSpock	providing /usr/share/i18n/locales/ or wherever ubuntu puts them
2013-01-04 01:37:24	MrSpock	R1cochet: font won't help when the box is stuck with the POSIX locale
2013-01-04 01:37:38	MrSpock	R1cochet: which, iirc, is ise8859-1
2013-01-04 01:37:41	MrSpock	iso*
2013-01-04 01:38:02	R1cochet	aww ok. yes that posix thing
2013-01-04 01:38:10	R1cochet	Bubo: /set charset*
2013-01-04 01:38:22	R1cochet	whats the value for decode?
2013-01-04 01:38:45	Bubo	I am on a pentium 4 PC. Running firefox + putty for ssh is a pain in the ass.
2013-01-04 01:38:55	Bubo	i'll upgrade and come back if the problem persists
2013-01-04 01:39:10	R1cochet	Bubo: whats is valude of decode from /set charset*
2013-01-04 01:40:37	Bubo	R1cochet: ANSI_X something
2013-01-04 01:40:42	--	MrSpock is now known as Python2
2013-01-04 01:40:44	R1cochet	weird
2013-01-04 01:41:16	R1cochet	Bubo: can u set it to default? "iso-8859-1"
2013-01-04 01:41:44	R1cochet	seems like locale could be the issue as mrspock pointed out
2013-01-04 01:41:55	R1cochet	all that posix stuff
2013-01-04 01:43:10	Bubo	how?

2013-01-04 01:44:16	R1cochet	does it work now?
2013-01-04 01:44:22	R1cochet	if not no idea
2013-01-04 01:44:28	Bubo	Nope
2013-01-04 01:44:36	Bubo	still ????? instead of cyrillic letters
2013-01-04 01:44:38	R1cochet	Bubo: no idea
2013-01-04 01:44:55	R1cochet	i would check with your distro's help channel
2013-01-04 01:45:07	R1cochet	#ubuntu iirc

I joined for example #debian and it got 9th place in the buffer. And then if you take a look at number 17. in my buffer. I want it to be on the next row. Either show whole channel och nothing. Understand what i mean?
2013-01-04 04:55:17	R1cochet	ehlu: to get 17 on the next row, you need to change the bar filling options

2013-01-04 07:29:10	meingtsla	Having said that... I prefer to set up a local bitlbee instance and connect to that for jabber :O
2013-01-04 07:30:39	jyfl987	well, after i disconnect the server, the cpu usage fall down to less than 1%
2013-01-04 07:31:07	meingtsla	Hm. What version of weechat
2013-01-04 07:31:44	jyfl987	its 0.3.7
2013-01-04 07:31:52	jyfl987	and the jabber plugin is written by python
2013-01-04 07:32:07	meingtsla	Yeah. Try upgrading to 0.3.9.2 and see if you still get 100% cpu utilization (it should be better, I think)
2013-01-04 07:32:11	Exio	0.3.7 == old, you should upgrade your weechat

2013-01-04 07:32:29	meingtsla	And yeah, securityfixesnao
2013-01-04 07:32:38	jyfl987	upgrade to which version?
2013-01-04 07:32:47	Exio	meingtsla said the version
2013-01-04 07:33:11	jyfl987	ok will try
2013-01-04 07:33:55	jyfl987	and is there another xmpp plugin?

2013-01-04 07:34:43	Exio	bitlbee can run locally
2013-01-04 07:35:23	Exio	you don't need to 'give' your password, you can run your own "private server" for that
2013-01-04 07:35:36	Exio	apt-get install bitlbee
2013-01-04 07:35:49	Exio	btw, i'm going to sleep, bye
2013-01-04 07:36:12	jyfl987	so why there arent a native xmpp support? since it claims that its multi-protocol
2013-01-04 07:36:20	jyfl987	you mean setup my server?
2013-01-04 07:36:27	jyfl987	but i need to use my gtalk account
2013-01-04 07:36:27	meingtsla	Good question, jyfl987
2013-01-04 07:38:09	jyfl987	meingtsla: is that means `we cant support that now while we refuse explain` ?
2013-01-04 07:38:41	meingtsla	jyfl987: 1. I'm not a WeeChat developer, so I can't speak for them. 2. It means I don't know, I'm wondering the same thing.
2013-01-04 07:39:03	jyfl987	meingtsla: ok
2013-01-04 07:39:57	jyfl987	there's only 2 things which let me migrate from irssi: 1, it claims that it support xmpp/jabber; 2, it dont use perl

2013-01-04 07:55:12	R1cochet	is there a way to add a tag that should be logged?
2013-01-04 07:55:20	@FlashCode	but according to OS, lines may be written before these 2 minutes
2013-01-04 07:55:51	@FlashCode	a tag to force a line to be written?
2013-01-04 07:55:56	R1cochet	for instance if i have a script and i want to log its output. can i create my own tag and tell logger to log messages with that tag?
2013-01-04 07:56:22	@FlashCode	you can use same tags as irc messages
2013-01-04 07:56:31	@FlashCode	look at /debug tags
2013-01-04 07:56:50	@FlashCode	for example use "log1"
2013-01-04 07:57:05	R1cochet	thank you

2013-01-04 12:09:34	irukandji	i am using tmux... i dont want all the windows the same...
2013-01-04 12:09:46	@FlashCode	it is because weechat does not fill whole terminal (empty areas are not filled)
2013-01-04 12:09:49	irukandji	but maybe tmux can do it for the current window only... lets see
2013-01-04 12:10:06	irukandji	but force option wouldnt be bad...

2013-01-04 12:11:04	@FlashCode	did you try ssh on a mobile phone? it's sometimes like a 56k modem ;)

2013-01-04 16:07:59	@FlashCode	pmo: why not in future allowing to change the type of a bar, it would make things easier I think
2013-01-04 16:08:19	@FlashCode	if that's what you mean

2013-01-04 16:20:49	@FlashCode	the docs are not perfect, I know that, and I constantly update them
2013-01-04 16:21:07	@FlashCode	so feedback from users is important (such questions were asked frequently, so I added that to doc)
2013-01-04 16:21:14	pmo	but you do understand why it is confusing for a beginner i think :)
2013-01-04 16:21:28	@FlashCode	yes I can understand that
2013-01-04 16:22:25	@FlashCode	but now that it's in docs, users have no excuse :D

2013-01-04 17:25:16	zobi8225	yea
2013-01-04 17:25:22	@FlashCode	maybe you have options in terminal, I have no idea
2013-01-04 17:25:25	[Fudge]	Does weechat have support for the znc/server-time capability?
2013-01-04 17:25:35	[Fudge]	Or does weechat not have ZNC integration?
2013-01-04 17:25:38	@FlashCode	[Fudge]: yes, in devel version
2013-01-04 17:25:48	[Fudge]	sweet :)
2013-01-04 17:25:54	@FlashCode	see: http://dev.weechat.org/post/2012/11/27/Tags-in-IRC-messages
2013-01-04 17:26:11	@FlashCode	and with relay plugin (irc proxy), you have server-time too

2013-01-04 17:26:50	zobi8225	ok thx
2013-01-04 17:27:07	[Fudge]	weechat looks very nice I must say
2013-01-04 17:27:11	grawity	[Fudge]: when reading that post, note that the cap name is "znc.in/server-time" for znc 1.0, and "znc.in/server-time-iso" for znc-git after 1.0
2013-01-04 17:27:25	[Fudge]	oh
2013-01-04 17:27:35	[Fudge]	I'm using 1.0

2013-01-04 17:27:59	grawity	[Fudge]: Weechat works with both, since it requires you to manually set the cap name anyway

2013-01-04 17:36:42	kernelPiCNic	Hello, I am looking at the user manual, but am unsure which is the exact sentence to change the color of the line that seperates the nick list, can someone tell me?

2013-01-04 17:39:03	kernelPiCNic	I mean the the nick list, not the window, FlashCode

2013-01-04 17:39:55	@FlashCode	I'll update the description
2013-01-04 17:39:57	grawity	oh. right
2013-01-04 17:40:12	kernelPiCNic	so... will have to wait?
2013-01-04 17:40:43	kernelPiCNic	its blue currently, if I am right. that vertical line.
2013-01-04 17:40:52	grawity	kernelPiCNic: no, will have to set weechat.color.separator to whatever color you want.
2013-01-04 17:41:10	grawity	[Fudge]: buffers.pl can do something very close
2013-01-04 17:41:22	[Fudge]	mm

2013-01-04 18:12:32	_grawity	How many channels do you have?
2013-01-04 18:12:50	[Fudge]	30 channels on one network
2013-01-04 18:12:54	[Fudge]	I have 11 networks to add
2013-01-04 18:13:00	[Fudge]	I am in 103 channels while connected to 12 networks. I have 1 o:lines, 25 ops, 2 halfops, and 17 voices with power over 118 individual users.

2013-01-04 19:18:28	Dan39	im confused as to how align_second with hook_timer works... setting it to 60 makes the timer start at 00 of the minute. what would 30 do, or 120?

2013-01-04 19:21:48	@FlashCode	if you use 30, first call will be when second == 30
2013-01-04 19:21:58	@FlashCode	and then using the interval for next calls
2013-01-04 19:22:29	Dan39	and what happens when you disable alignment, the countdown starts from now and repeats?
2013-01-04 19:23:08	@FlashCode	yes
2013-01-04 19:23:18	@FlashCode	if interval is 2 seconds, first call is exactly in 2 seconds
2013-01-04 19:23:34	@FlashCode	most of times, you don't need alignment
2013-01-04 19:23:47	@FlashCode	alignment is used for example to display time (by weechat itself)
2013-01-04 19:24:06	Dan39	so if i did a timer for 2 seconds interval, no repeat, and set alignment to 60, that 2 second countdown wouldnt start until the beginning of next minute?

2013-01-04 19:27:52	@FlashCode	in fact you should have interval >= alignment
2013-01-04 19:28:10	Dan39	wow that was weird
2013-01-04 19:28:29	@FlashCode	or in fact interval which is a factor of alignment (like alignment, 2*alignment, ..)

2013-01-04 19:29:15	Dan39	shouldnt that not repeat?
2013-01-04 19:29:45	@FlashCode	this timer should repeat each 5 seconds

2013-01-04 20:20:01	Dan39	thats a lot
2013-01-04 20:20:03	StarWeaver	FlashCode, um, couple random questions in my head for future development... (1) Is it possible to modify the timestamp portion of a line via scripts and (2) is it possible to completely hide the buffer name prefix from merged buffers and (3) is it possible to use /buffer set to hide timestamps from just chanmon?
2013-01-04 20:20:04	Dan39	omg
2013-01-04 20:20:16	Dan39	thats like 20%?
2013-01-04 20:20:25	Dan39	err maybe not that much
2013-01-04 20:21:04	@FlashCode	~5.1%
2013-01-04 20:21:06	Dan39	5%... my math sucks
2013-01-04 20:21:11	StarWeaver	Wait, 2 and 3 aren't devlopment related ... i'm just spacy o.o

2013-01-04 20:21:25	Dan39	im good at equations and stuff, just not doing basic math in my head
2013-01-04 20:21:36	@FlashCode	StarWeaver: for 1), yes, see this example: http://weechat.org/files/temp/scripts/hdata_update.py
2013-01-04 20:22:02	@FlashCode	(requires version >= 0.3.9)
2013-01-04 20:22:12	Dan39	might be better to do that stuff with a C plugin?

2013-01-04 20:24:42	@FlashCode	StarWeaver: and for 3) you can disable timestamp on a single buffer with:  /buffer set time_for_each_line 0
2013-01-04 20:24:55	nils_2	FlashCode: iirc weebot also answered in query some month ago. did you remove that?
2013-01-04 20:24:59	@FlashCode	(maybe this could be done in chanmon script if not already done)
2013-01-04 20:25:23	KenjiE20	just checked, the only time stuff *mon's do is to pull normal timecodes for bar
2013-01-04 20:25:35	@FlashCode	nils_2: I did not remove that, but maybe it works only if bot is registered on network (not sure if he is currently)
2013-01-04 20:26:06	@FlashCode	of course removing timestamp should be optional :)
2013-01-04 20:26:21	Dan39	hmmm you know what would be pretty cool, if FlashCode made a bot type program kinda
2013-01-04 20:26:58	@FlashCode	Dan39: weebot is a supybot, and it's OK for my needs, no need to write another one ;)

2013-01-04 20:32:39	Dan39	hmm yea i know there was a way to deny access to all commands unless you specified to allow it, intead of the default way which is you specify what not to allow

2013-01-04 20:32:57	Dan39	i cant remember lol
2013-01-04 20:33:15	StarWeaver	FlashCode, (2) I might throw in a low priority feature request to hide it just for completeness sake, and (3) Cool, that works ... is there a list of stuff that works with /buffer set that isn't e.g. findable in iset? O.o
2013-01-04 20:34:09	Dan39	StarWeaver: do this...
2013-01-04 20:34:14	Dan39	type /buffer set

2013-01-05 13:47:09	osse	if weechat can deal with python3 scripts then why reject them?
2013-01-05 13:49:24	@FlashCode	I mean reject if script works only in python 2 and not python 3 (and if it's possible/easy to make it work with python 3)
2013-01-05 13:49:55	@FlashCode	so that new scripts will be OK (and we need only to update old/existing scripts)
2013-01-05 13:51:11	nils_2	how can i test if script does not work with python3?
2013-01-05 13:51:29	@FlashCode	compile weechat with python3, and test script
2013-01-05 13:51:46	@FlashCode	here I'm using a dir build-python3, where I force path to python3 with cmake
2013-01-05 13:54:09	nils_2	i have Python 3.2.3 and Python 2.7.3 installed
2013-01-05 13:54:36	nils_2	how to force compiling with python3?
2013-01-05 13:54:36	@FlashCode	for debian (unstable): cmake -DPYTHON_INCLUDE_PATH=/usr/include/python3.2 -DPYTHON_LIBRARY=/usr/lib/libpython3.2mu.so
2013-01-05 13:54:55	@FlashCode	names can be different for other distros
2013-01-05 13:55:12	@FlashCode	maybe I should add an option in cmake to use python3, would be easier
2013-01-05 13:55:19	@FlashCode	something like cmake -DPYTHON3=ON
2013-01-05 13:55:23	nils_2	i think so too
2013-01-05 13:55:52	@FlashCode	I'll look at that
2013-01-05 13:57:19	osse	Is it possible to make weechat support py2 and py3 scripts seperately?
2013-01-05 13:58:07	@FlashCode	support of python 2 or 3 is make when compiling: the python plugin can be compiled with either python 2 or 3
2013-01-05 13:58:37	@FlashCode	you can not compile with both at same time
2013-01-05 13:59:00	osse	ahh. I guess my "solution" would be to have two python plugins then. Don't know how much work that would be.

2013-01-05 13:59:28	@FlashCode	I think it's easier to make scripts compatible with both ;)
2013-01-05 13:59:37	@FlashCode	for most scripts, it's minor changes
2013-01-05 13:59:46	@FlashCode	but for some scripts (like jabber), I'm not sure it's even possible :p
2013-01-05 13:59:56	@FlashCode	if some libs have not been ported to python 3
2013-01-05 14:00:44	@FlashCode	scripts compatible with python 3 are tagged (other may work, but not tested): http://weechat.org/scripts/stable/tag/py3k-ok/
2013-01-05 14:04:49	nils_2	for ubuntu its /usr/lib/libpython3.2mu.so.1.0
2013-01-05 14:05:03	@FlashCode	I'll add option in cmake

2013-01-05 22:34:28	grawity	Rasi: yeah, but the problem is that with plain IRC, scrollback isn't very integrated
2013-01-05 22:34:50	grawity	Rasi: IRC didn't have a way to send the message's time – until very recently
2013-01-05 22:35:29	grawity	Rasi: so when you connected to the proxy, the entire scrollback would have the same timestamps, and the messages would look like "23:34 <grawity> [17:45] some message"

2013-01-06 03:41:33	pmo	dont load
2013-01-06 03:41:46	R1cochet	pmo: then they must be linked wrong
2013-01-06 03:42:00	pmo	the issue is that i had weechat working perfectly on a debian box
2013-01-06 03:42:11	R1cochet	what scripts wont load?
2013-01-06 03:42:18	pmo	then backed them up and moved them to another debian box
2013-01-06 03:42:25	pmo	now /script doesnt work at all
2013-01-06 03:42:28	wood_quinn	Oddly enough, when I input unicode characters they aren't displayed correctly in the input bar.
2013-01-06 03:42:35	pmo	when you load in /script, they autoload
2013-01-06 03:42:36	wood_quinn	But, they're displayed correctly in the buffer.

2013-01-06 03:48:57	pmo	2 sec
2013-01-06 03:49:04	R1cochet	if that doesnt work, i suggest you remove the scripts and their symlinks, and then reinstall with /script. see if it adds a symlink for them.
2013-01-06 03:49:10	R1cochet	keep your .conf files ofc
2013-01-06 03:49:15	pmo	no change

2013-01-06 03:49:41	pmo	forgets scripts
2013-01-06 03:49:42	R1cochet	and what is everything?
2013-01-06 03:49:57	R1cochet	pmo: what forgets scripts?
2013-01-06 03:49:59	pmo	everything related to scripts in weechat = borked
2013-01-06 03:50:02	grawity	R1cochet: the default permissions should be fine – everything in ~/.weechat is owned by *you*, and by default you get full permissions on directories you have created
2013-01-06 03:50:03	pmo	i can load them
2013-01-06 03:50:15	R1cochet	grawity: agreed
2013-01-06 03:50:15	pmo	then if i quit and connect back i have to load all scripts again
2013-01-06 03:50:27	R1cochet	pmo: it sounds like your links are wrong
2013-01-06 03:50:31	grawity	R1cochet: on the other hand, if you set directories to 0644, it actually breaks things :D
2013-01-06 03:50:32	wood_quinn	pmo: What's this, quit IRC?
2013-01-06 03:50:38	wood_quinn	Why would you ever do that?
2013-01-06 03:50:40	R1cochet	i would clear all the symlinks in the autoload dirs
2013-01-06 03:50:44	R1cochet	then create them yourself
2013-01-06 03:50:44	pmo	R1cochet: it needs to add links before they are wrong :)
2013-01-06 03:50:49	grawity	directories must always have the execute permission

2013-01-06 03:58:32	grawity	wood_quinn: (also, +x doesn't allow directory listing, +r does)
2013-01-06 03:58:47	wood_quinn	Most of the time you want dirlistings in your homedir, obviously :)
2013-01-06 03:58:55	wood_quinn	It'd be pretty unhelpful not to.

2013-01-06 04:34:32	pmo	it has alzheimers
2013-01-06 04:34:44	grawity	are you talking about /script, or about the individual language plugins?
2013-01-06 04:34:57	pmo	all scripts
2013-01-06 04:35:07	pmo	using /script to load them
2013-01-06 04:35:10	pmo	it forgets
2013-01-06 04:35:36	grawity	/script is only involved in downloading them ...
2013-01-06 04:35:44	pmo	and loading them
2013-01-06 04:35:51	grawity	not after restarts, only once.
2013-01-06 04:35:52	pmo	once you load them it adds them to autoload
2013-01-06 04:35:56	_`_	did you try /interpreter load ~/.weechat/whatever/autoload/whatever.whatever ?

2013-01-06 04:36:17	pmo	on the other system i loaded scripts with /script

2013-01-06 04:39:19	R1cochet	pmo: i suggest you backup your .conf files
2013-01-06 04:39:30	pmo	what it seems to be, you cannot backup weechat and put it on another system
2013-01-06 04:39:38	R1cochet	completely remove weechat and all of ~/.weechat and then reinstall
2013-01-06 04:39:39	torque	did you remove all of the plugin dirs, python perl etc and make new ones to guarantee this isn't a permissions fuckup
2013-01-06 04:39:47	torque	when in doubt chmod -R 777 is a terrible idea
2013-01-06 04:39:48	R1cochet	move .conf back
2013-01-06 04:39:50	_`_	^ good idea
2013-01-06 04:39:55	pmo	R1cochet: not an option
2013-01-06 04:39:58	_`_	check permissions
2013-01-06 04:40:01	pmo	takes too long to set all back up
2013-01-06 04:40:04	R1cochet	?
2013-01-06 04:40:07	R1cochet	how
2013-01-06 04:40:11	pmo	they are fine _`_
2013-01-06 04:40:15	R1cochet	thats why you backup the .conf files
2013-01-06 04:40:20	pmo	i did backup
2013-01-06 04:40:22	R1cochet	then you wont have to setup everything
2013-01-06 04:40:26	pmo	this does NOT work

2013-01-06 04:40:49	_`_	weird...
2013-01-06 04:40:50	R1cochet	pmo: you backed up everything you said earlier
2013-01-06 04:40:56	pmo	yes
2013-01-06 04:40:57	R1cochet	im suggesting to only backup the .conf files
2013-01-06 04:41:09	pmo	but why delete and add the same b0rked backup over?
2013-01-06 04:41:16	_`_	oh then nab the scripts manually with /script?
2013-01-06 04:41:26	pmo	no go
2013-01-06 04:41:39	R1cochet	pmo: did you manually edit the script conf file?

2013-01-06 11:12:41	R1cochet	^pawned
2013-01-06 11:13:06	@FlashCode	Nei: these calls are supposed to change the input line, right? and then the signal is sent, it's OK for me, or did I miss something?
2013-01-06 11:13:51	Nei	you could argue that I am 'abusing' it
2013-01-06 11:14:11	Nei	the fact that after my 2x buffer_set input, the input is the same as before
2013-01-06 11:14:25	@FlashCode	ah I see
2013-01-06 11:14:29	Nei	so it would be better if I could do it in hidden, as to not confuse other scripts who listen for this signal
2013-01-06 11:15:03	@FlashCode	I think it's possible to disable the hook print, but not signals, I'll check
2013-01-06 11:23:11	nils_2	how about testing the input_line and no changes are made (cursor movement, for example) the signal should be eaten

2013-01-06 11:44:46	roughnecks	ok
2013-01-06 11:44:48	@FlashCode	it's very stable, you can install it if you want
2013-01-06 11:45:10	@FlashCode	I'm fixing the problem, should be done in a few hours max
2013-01-06 11:45:26	@FlashCode	could you please file a bug on savannah while I'm fixing?

2013-01-06 12:23:04	R1cochet	does grep.py use it's own buffer? and can i tail a file with it or only regex?

2013-01-06 12:23:09	pbos	when I get around to it I want to throw out pidgin
2013-01-06 12:23:21	pbos	I meant as a pidgin replacement
2013-01-06 12:23:31	pbos	or bitlbee replacement

2013-01-06 12:24:07	seschwar	bitlbee can also use libpurple

2013-01-06 13:06:55	roughnecks	swimmer: other people in #bitlbee complained about FB.. and probably it's just FB's fault
2013-01-06 13:07:32	swimmer	FlashCode: 'could not authenticate'
2013-01-06 13:07:42	swimmer	it might be because I'm using the JID ...

2013-01-06 13:12:36	roughnecks	ok FlashCode
2013-01-06 13:14:54	@FlashCode	Nei: for the signal sent, if that could help, I can allow callback of a signal to return WEECHAT_RC_OK_EAT, to discard a signal
2013-01-06 13:14:57	swimmer	not sure if I feel comfortable though with plain text authentication ;-)
2013-01-06 13:15:15	@FlashCode	so you can hook the signal (with high priority, so that your callback is called first), then just return WEECHAT_RC_OK_EAT
2013-01-06 13:15:23	@FlashCode	and when your changes are done, unhook this signal

2013-01-06 13:44:14	aspiers	i.e. bind a key to: toggle nicklist/buffer bar, prefix_align, and align_end_of_lines
2013-01-06 13:44:21	@FlashCode	do not edit files by hand, it's not recommended
2013-01-06 13:44:33	@FlashCode	after setting username, you reconnected to server?
2013-01-06 13:44:35	fictive	changing my realname is working, though, just not the username
2013-01-06 13:44:37	fictive	yes
2013-01-06 13:44:42	fictive	even tried restarting weechat
2013-01-06 13:44:48	@FlashCode	where do you see the username you want to change?
2013-01-06 13:45:11	fictive	I really hope this is the username now, haha
2013-01-06 13:45:17	aspiers	FlashCode: is there a way to make /save only save differences to the default settings?
2013-01-06 13:45:17	fictive	it's your ident, right?
2013-01-06 13:45:30	@FlashCode	fictive: it can be, but server may put something else here
2013-01-06 13:45:40	@FlashCode	aspiers: no
2013-01-06 13:45:43	swimmer	ohh - jabber.py logs in the top dir :-/ And even with spaces :-/
2013-01-06 13:45:45	aspiers	FlashCode: like /key listdiff but for everything
2013-01-06 13:45:54	fictive	like espenja@server.fub where espenja would be my username
2013-01-06 13:46:05	@FlashCode	with /save you can specify a single file to save, that's all (but whole file is written)
2013-01-06 13:46:20	aspiers	FlashCode: that would be useful during version upgrades, so that defaults can change
2013-01-06 13:46:45	fictive	the server can't put my server username there without it being sent to the server. so my initial guess would be that without specifying a username, weechat sends your current username to the server
2013-01-06 13:46:56	fictive	but that should be overwritten by the username variable, shouldn't it?
2013-01-06 13:46:59	@FlashCode	aspiers: for what purpose? when you /upgrade, files are saved, and then read as a normal startup
2013-01-06 13:47:26	@FlashCode	fictive: you can check in /server raw, you'll see messages sent to server
2013-01-06 13:47:37	fictive	good point
2013-01-06 13:47:41	fictive	I'll check
2013-01-06 13:47:57	@FlashCode	the USER command should be sent with your username
2013-01-06 13:48:12	aspiers	FlashCode: currently, if /save saves everything, how is weechat able to distinguish between what is default and what the user has set?
2013-01-06 13:48:14	@FlashCode	(spaces are replaced by "_" IIRC)
2013-01-06 13:48:35	@FlashCode	aspiers: in devel, the /set can show changed options
2013-01-06 13:48:39	@FlashCode	with /set diff
2013-01-06 13:48:54	@FlashCode	weechat knows what is default value for option, and the current value
2013-01-06 13:49:22	aspiers	FlashCode: nice :) but if the user sets the current value to the default value, that should be treated differently to the case where the user didn't set it at all
2013-01-06 13:49:37	aspiers	in the first case, the user is asking to keep the default value permanently
2013-01-06 13:49:52	aspiers	in the second case, if the default changes (e.g. during upgrade), the user should get the new default
2013-01-06 13:50:17	aspiers	maybe I'm missing something
2013-01-06 13:51:06	aspiers	ah, I see the config files have "foo = default" for defaults

2013-01-06 13:52:20	@FlashCode	the config files have only current values
2013-01-06 13:52:23	@FlashCode	you don't see defaults
2013-01-06 13:52:33	@FlashCode	the defaults are know by weechat, but they are not in config files

2013-01-06 14:38:52	Nei	try mu multiline script ;)
2013-01-06 14:39:05	grawity	adam_: That isn't a multi-line message, it's just two separate messages sent at once
2013-01-06 14:39:06	aspiers	ok, so I guess the client just sends two separate messages one immediately after the other
2013-01-06 14:39:12	aspiers	but that's still useful
2013-01-06 14:39:20	aspiers	since it significantly shrinks the race window
2013-01-06 14:39:33	grawity	It doesn't – the server throttles your messages after sending 2-4 lines.
2013-01-06 14:39:37	aspiers	without that, the race window is as long as the time it takes you to type the second message
2013-01-06 14:39:41	Nei	depends on the server
2013-01-06 14:39:45	grawity	Anyway, if you just want to paste a couple of lines at once, you can do that just fine in weechat
2013-01-06 14:40:06	Nei	it has its advantage to be able to edit what you paste, though
2013-01-06 14:40:24	aspiers	Nei: correct, I'm also talking about the case where you're manually typing code
2013-01-06 14:40:27	aspiers	rather than pasting

2013-01-06 14:42:32	Nei	and 2 messages are as good as multi-message as you get in irc
2013-01-06 14:43:12	swimmer	ok - another weechat crash but this time with a debuggable core -> https://gist.github.com/4467218
2013-01-06 14:44:10	aspiers	so in summary, this is a useful feature which weechat appears to be missing right now
2013-01-06 14:44:18	aspiers	I can live without though
2013-01-06 14:44:39	Nei	aspiers: /script install multiline.pl
2013-01-06 14:45:07	Nei	swimmer: probably a bug in a script
2013-01-06 14:45:23	swimmer	last script installed was jabber.py ;-)
2013-01-06 14:45:25	aspiers	Nei: ooh, sounds good, thanks :)
2013-01-06 14:45:43	aspiers	it seems that the script repository uses git on the backend
2013-01-06 14:45:51	aspiers	so why not simply expose the repo?
2013-01-06 14:45:54	Nei	weechat uses git
2013-01-06 14:46:05	Nei	you can get the repo if you want
2013-01-06 14:46:12	aspiers	the scripts are in the main repo?
2013-01-06 14:46:19	Nei	in the weechat-scripts repo
2013-01-06 14:46:35	aspiers	found it
2013-01-06 14:46:38	aspiers	cool :)
2013-01-06 14:46:59	aspiers	would be nicer if we could issue pull requests via github though ;-)
2013-01-06 14:50:19	aspiers	it would be nice if /foo help was automatically equivalent to /help foo
2013-01-06 14:50:37	aspiers	or at least if the plugin foo doesn't define the help subcommand
2013-01-06 14:51:29	Nei	there is always so much to complain about
2013-01-06 14:51:30	swimmer	FlashCode: sorry I forgot to highlight you :-/ Another weechat crash but this time with a debuggable core -> https://gist.github.com/4467218
2013-01-06 14:51:50	aspiers	Nei: definitely not complaining ;-) just ideas to make weechat even more awesome
2013-01-06 14:52:56	aspiers	Nei: /script install multiline.pl requires downloading multiline.pl first, right? or do you have the whole scripts repo locally and then somehow select which plugins to install?
2013-01-06 14:53:00	Nei	but most commands take an argument so it might be a bit confusing if /join help joins the help channel or does /help join
2013-01-06 14:53:09	Nei	it will download for you
2013-01-06 14:54:12	kany	I like this room
2013-01-06 14:55:30	aspiers	Nei: true, I don't know if the scripting API allows the core to detect whether the plugin accepts 'help' as an argument
2013-01-06 14:55:42	aspiers	Nei: I'm guessing there's no programmatic way to do this safely :-/
2013-01-06 14:55:59	Nei	I think just always use /help command
2013-01-06 14:56:06	Nei	is a pretty fine approach :)
2013-01-06 14:56:18	Nei	and there is also an F1 script
2013-01-06 14:56:44	aspiers	Nei: yeah, that's somewhat counter-intuitive though because a lot of other programs support "$COMMAND $SUBCOMMAND help"
2013-01-06 14:56:52	aspiers	or "$COMMAND $SUBCOMMAND --help"
2013-01-06 14:57:05	aspiers	so my brain is used to putting the "help" word last :-/
2013-01-06 14:57:09	aspiers	I can live with it though ;-)
2013-01-06 14:58:00	aspiers	Nei: script: Yoda says: "install" is not a valid command. “Do or do not... there is no try”...
2013-01-06 14:58:18	aspiers	I guess I have an old version?
2013-01-06 14:58:38	Nei	did you type /script install inside weechat?

2013-01-06 15:29:31	R1cochet	lol
2013-01-06 15:30:10	aspiers	is it possible to configure multiline.pl so that Enter behaves normally (i.e. single line) but Ctrl-J is the magic key?
2013-01-06 15:30:41	aspiers	ah, I managed it
2013-01-06 15:30:48	-->	DaZ (~derp@87-205-249-184.adsl.inetia.pl) has joined #weechat
2013-01-06 15:31:12	Nei	if you want paste detection to work enter=ctrl+m needs to be bound to the magic key
2013-01-06 15:31:29	aspiers	ah
2013-01-06 15:32:06	Nei	you can set the option paste_only to true if you dont want multilines by default
2013-01-06 15:32:21	Nei	then you can explicitly bind e.g ctrl-O /input insert \x0a
2013-01-06 15:32:38	Nei	or ctrl-J should work too
2013-01-06 15:34:43	aspiers	ok great, thanks
2013-01-06 15:35:00	Nei	the simple config api only supports strings
2013-01-06 15:35:47	Nei	for help you can try /script install cmd_help.py
2013-01-06 15:35:52	aspiers	ah I see
2013-01-06 15:36:14	Nei	then read /help cmd_help
2013-01-06 15:36:19	Nei	quite funny thing
2013-01-06 15:40:13	aspiers	now I get: Error: ambigous command "script": it exists in many plugins and not in "core" plugin
2013-01-06 15:40:24	 *	aspiers hopes to be done with the newbie questions soon :-/
2013-01-06 15:41:11	Nei	what does /help script report

2013-01-06 15:42:10	aspiers	it shows both [perl/script] and [script]
2013-01-06 15:42:37	Nei	thats the problem then
2013-01-06 15:42:51	aspiers	sure, but how do I get rid of it? :) is it a symptom of the upgrade?
2013-01-06 15:43:06	aspiers	could try restarting
2013-01-06 15:43:19	Nei	try /command script script remove script.pl
2013-01-06 15:43:54	Nei	see if /script works after that
2013-01-06 15:44:36	aspiers	script: script "script.pl" not found
2013-01-06 15:44:49	Nei	mh
2013-01-06 15:44:56	Nei	then try /perl unload script.pl
2013-01-06 15:44:59	aspiers	ok
2013-01-06 15:45:01	nils_2	/perl unload script
2013-01-06 15:45:16	Nei	and remove any script.pl files from your .weechat subfolders
2013-01-06 15:45:20	Nei	and I'm really confused as to why neither nils_2 nor FlashCode have programmed something into script.pl that auto-kills it on 0.3.9
2013-01-06 15:45:29	nils_2	/script remove script.pl
2013-01-06 15:45:32	aspiers	yep, that worked great
2013-01-06 15:45:34	aspiers	thanks!
2013-01-06 15:45:55	Nei	make sure you remove the file from .weechat/perl/autload or wherever, otherwise you have the same problem on next start
2013-01-06 15:45:55	nils_2	Nei: i did. but you need the latest version of script.pl :p
2013-01-06 15:46:36	aspiers	ah, /script is in core now?
2013-01-06 15:46:52	nils_2	script plugin is installed. No need to install script: $PRGNAME.pl. Script automatically removed...
2013-01-06 15:46:58	Nei	well its a plugin now
2013-01-06 15:47:16	aspiers	script.so - I see it
2013-01-06 15:47:19	aspiers	ok, removing script.pl
2013-01-06 15:47:50	R1cochet	whats script.pl?
2013-01-06 15:47:59	Nei	the old /script
2013-01-06 15:48:58	nils_2	only useful if you are using weechat <0.3.9 or if you don't want to install the script plugin!
2013-01-06 15:49:20	Nei	i.e not very useful *anymore* ;)
2013-01-06 15:49:21	R1cochet	i thought that was weeget
2013-01-06 15:49:30	Nei	weeget+script = new script
2013-01-06 15:49:45	nils_2	script.pl and weeget.py = script plugin
2013-01-06 15:50:05	R1cochet	hmm never saw script.pl
2013-01-06 15:50:15	nils_2	script.pl description: to load/reload/unload script (language independent) and also to create/remove symlink
2013-01-06 15:50:45	R1cochet	dont see it in script buffer either lol
2013-01-06 15:50:56	nils_2	you can't :p
2013-01-06 15:50:59	Nei	you shouldnt because you dont need it
2013-01-06 15:51:02	R1cochet	ok
2013-01-06 15:51:07	R1cochet	:)
2013-01-06 15:51:13	Nei	but its on the website if youre curious
2013-01-06 15:51:20	R1cochet	cool
2013-01-06 15:51:31	nils_2	min/max 0.3.0/0.3.8
2013-01-06 15:51:38	FiXato	I disagree nils_2. The script plugin is missing the option to just autoload/autounload scripts.
2013-01-06 15:52:06	R1cochet	so it filters out useless/deprecated scripts just like if plugin isnt loaded
2013-01-06 15:52:33	nils_2	script plugin uses the min/max version
2013-01-06 15:52:43	R1cochet	nice
2013-01-06 15:53:00	nils_2	FiXato: please add a task. this option is still missing iirc

2013-01-06 16:01:31	pmo	btw FlashCode, i got it fixed last night with help from R1cochet :)
2013-01-06 16:01:56	pmo	the symlinks coudnt handle the move hehe
2013-01-06 16:02:24	pmo	but we agreed on it had to be vmware ^^
2013-01-06 16:03:14	_`_	Oh yeah I was going to ask, which vmware was it, workstation, player, ESXi/vsphere?
2013-01-06 16:03:26	pmo	workstation
2013-01-06 16:03:30	_`_	oh ok
2013-01-06 16:03:31	pmo	debian wheezy
2013-01-06 16:03:51	pmo	i moved the files using an usb stick
2013-01-06 16:03:54	pmo	fat32
2013-01-06 16:04:15	MrElendig	symlinks doesn't really work on fat
2013-01-06 16:04:27	pmo	oh that explains it all then
2013-01-06 16:04:42	_`_	he said he tarbelled the dotdir though, unless that was done wrong
2013-01-06 16:04:49	MrElendig	and ofcourse relative versus absolute symlinks
2013-01-06 16:04:53	pmo	i did tarball it
2013-01-06 16:05:07	MrElendig	don't remember of /script makes relative symlinks or not
2013-01-06 16:05:20	pmo	tarballed it with my backup script ( no typo )
2013-01-06 16:05:21	MrElendig	relative will work, absolute will not /unless exact same dir structure
2013-01-06 16:05:43	pmo	i had to remove them all and add them back :)
2013-01-06 16:06:36	pmo	next time i move its gonna be over ssh

2013-01-06 20:47:41	ubergeek42	did you have the right port set up in weechat for using ssl?(there is a port for non-ssl and a separate port for ssl connections)
2013-01-06 20:50:38	monty	by the way, ubergeek42, is there a way to hide the topics in the bufferlist (if not, adding such an option)?
2013-01-06 20:50:44	monty	for the androind client, ofc
2013-01-06 20:51:22	ubergeek42	no option yet, but that seems simple enough to add.  I assume your goal is to see more buffers at once?
2013-01-06 20:51:49	monty	yeah :)
2013-01-06 20:52:07	monty	should i make a req at the github?
2013-01-06 20:53:42	ubergeek42	I'll take care of it; I'll probably just do it now and ping you when its done.  Should be a relatively quick change.

2013-01-06 21:36:41	Timbo	say you have weechat running as a proxy
2013-01-06 21:37:00	Timbo	then two clients connected to it, say client1 and client2
2013-01-06 21:37:21	Timbo	if I engage in a /query with someone on client1, it all works and looks fine
2013-01-06 21:37:32	Timbo	the same exchange looks fine on weechat
2013-01-06 21:38:00	Timbo	but if I look at client2 the exchange is split into 2 windows, one for each of the /query participants
2013-01-06 21:38:44	Timbo	basically, that client doesn't have enough information to know what's going on
2013-01-06 21:39:15	Timbo	it's a general problem that occurs with many irc proxies
2013-01-06 21:39:44	Timbo	there are a couple that solve it in the way I have in my irssi patch, but most appear to ignore the problem
2013-01-06 21:40:23	Timbo	I've been trying to get that patch into irssi or the ubuntu package without much luck, so I thought I'd check if weechat fixes it and switch over if it did

2013-01-09 18:16:57	bassliner	ok, seems to be nice to have some namespace-like layout for functions to be bound to keybindings that are seperated with ".", but typing foo.bar.baz<TAB> to complete inside the third one will complete anything starting with foo. also, delete_previous_word deletes everything including those dots. but that's probably terrible or impossible to configure.

2013-01-10 13:44:35	@FlashCode	nyuszika7h: you can change messages coming from server, and for example split a message into 2 (so create a new one)
2013-01-10 13:44:46	@FlashCode	but you can not simulate a message as if it was coming from a server
2013-01-10 13:44:57	nyuszika7h	:(
2013-01-10 13:45:06	@FlashCode	what are you doing?
2013-01-10 13:45:11	@FlashCode	maybe there are other ways to do ;)
2013-01-10 13:47:38	FiXato	set up an ircd of your own and use a RAW module of it to send custom crafted messages to your client? :P

2013-01-10 13:54:46	@FlashCode	same
2013-01-10 13:55:06	@FlashCode	it's even more, because the print is calling print_date_tags ;)
2013-01-10 13:55:47	R1cochet	aww thank you
2013-01-10 13:56:01	@FlashCode	hmm no in fact, exactly same
2013-01-10 13:56:05	@FlashCode	because it's done by a macro
2013-01-10 13:56:10	R1cochet	oh ok
2013-01-10 13:56:28	@FlashCode	so if you do print(buffer, "message") in fact it will call: print_date_tags(buffer, 0, "", "message")

2013-01-10 14:09:38	Nei	R1cochet: the weechat perl plugin code sucks
2013-01-10 14:09:53	Nei	I tried to improve it a bit but that caused crash on /script install
2013-01-10 14:10:23	Nei	and I dont know why ;p I think someone is messing with $!
2013-01-10 14:10:27	R1cochet	read that typeglobs are bad for filehandles and going to be deprecated
2013-01-10 14:10:44	Nei	so I improved it one more time
2013-01-10 14:10:55	R1cochet	haha :)

2013-01-10 14:15:48	R1cochet	nyuszika7h you can open another instance of weechat
2013-01-10 14:15:58	Nei	anyway  weechat cant do it directly

2013-01-10 14:16:06	R1cochet	i do it when testing my scripts
2013-01-10 14:16:13	@FlashCode	nyuszika7h: it's for testing a received message?
2013-01-10 14:16:20	nyuszika7h	yep
2013-01-10 14:16:58	@FlashCode	if needed, there is a fake irc server in test/weercd.py
2013-01-10 14:17:03	R1cochet	nyuszika7h if you join/part the channel in other instance that doesnt help?
2013-01-10 14:17:04	@FlashCode	you can send any command to weechat with that
2013-01-10 14:17:23	nyuszika7h	R1cochet: you don't understand my point
2013-01-10 14:18:03	nyuszika7h	I can't start another instance, /nick FlashCode, /join #weechat and say "hi"
2013-01-10 14:18:17	R1cochet	please explain. im under the impression you are trying to hook a signal or message and act accordingly
2013-01-10 14:19:18	R1cochet	you can open another instance and /nick nicknottaken /j #weechat and /msg hi
2013-01-10 14:19:30	nyuszika7h	R1cochet: you still don't get it
2013-01-10 14:19:39	MrElendig	nyuszika7h: explain more clearly then
2013-01-10 14:19:46	R1cochet	but probably best to join a different channel
2013-01-10 14:19:47	nyuszika7h	I want to fake a message from a nick that is used... only for my client
2013-01-10 14:20:12	nyuszika7h	in hexchat, I can do /recv :ChanServ!ChanServ@services. PRIVMSG #weechat :hi
2013-01-10 14:20:15	MrElendig	nyuszika7h: craft a packet
2013-01-10 14:20:38	nyuszika7h	MrElendig: you mean I should make weechat think I'm the server?
2013-01-10 14:20:43	Nei	weechat cant do it and a script can only do it when you piggy back an existing message
2013-01-10 14:20:54	MrElendig	nyuszika7h: that works
2013-01-10 14:20:56	R1cochet	nyuszika7h what is the point then if you are just faking messages?
2013-01-10 14:21:13	MrElendig	nyuszika7h: or learn C and add the feature
2013-01-10 14:21:24	@FlashCode	oh wait!
2013-01-10 14:21:31	@FlashCode	I added that, I didn't remember :D
2013-01-10 14:21:33	nyuszika7h	surely there is a way to make weechat print something to a buffer that looks like a message from ChanServ?
2013-01-10 14:21:38	@FlashCode	try /server fakerecv <message>
2013-01-10 14:21:42	nyuszika7h	:p

2013-01-10 14:22:38	Nei	shouldnt that be documented
2013-01-10 14:22:58	@FlashCode	Nei: it's because it can cause bugs if you receive something wrong
2013-01-10 14:23:06	@FlashCode	so it was hidden to not be used in scripts for example
2013-01-10 14:23:31	@FlashCode	anyway you'll tell me that scripts could do other things that are bad, like misuse of a pointer :p
2013-01-10 14:23:37	Nei	some other people argue that irc clients should be programmed defensively and NOT crash when receiving weird crap
2013-01-10 14:23:45	R1cochet	lol thats what he wants it for

2013-01-10 14:26:24	@FlashCode	Nei: yes, in the mode "manual send", so that I can send a custom message
2013-01-10 14:26:39	@FlashCode	but with /server fakerecv, it would have been even faster!

2013-01-10 14:26:56	Nei	the difficulty is to get good test coverage

2013-01-10 14:27:14	Nei	even "wrong" ones
2013-01-10 14:27:17	@FlashCode	yes I see

2013-01-10 14:32:56	Nei	if it is necessary to be able to access the snomask, that part might be a feature request. but the front part looks like a bug
2013-01-10 14:33:03	@FlashCode	btw I think now I stop at first space when reading usermodes
2013-01-10 14:33:11	@FlashCode	so maybe the behaviour has changed recently

2013-01-10 15:13:22	Nei	ctrl+y works with the weechat-internal clipboard
2013-01-10 15:13:24	Uranio	Hi all, exist any plugion for "buddy punce" I mean, something that giving to it a list of nick and then get notified when one os these nick come loged in. Sorry my catastrofic english...
2013-01-10 15:14:17	Nei	Uranio: maybe something like /notify, see /help notify
2013-01-10 15:14:49	Nei	seed419: I'm using multiline so I don't usually care about pastes in the way you might
2013-01-10 15:14:51	FiXato	Uranio, have a look at buddylist.pl
2013-01-10 15:15:00	Uranio	Nei: thanks

2013-01-10 15:17:21	Nei	maybe I'm not clear on what your issue is
2013-01-10 15:17:33	Nei	what are you pasting? from somewhere else with the mouse?
2013-01-10 15:17:58	seed419	Keyboard with shift + ins
2013-01-10 15:18:28	Nei	so the "paste" is made by your terminal sending the text in your X buffer through to weechat
2013-01-10 15:18:50	Nei	and then weechat should ask you "do you want to paste 10 lines [ctrl-y/ctrl-n]"
2013-01-10 15:19:13	seed419	right
2013-01-10 15:19:24	seed419	assuming I have a 10 line limit set in the configuration file
2013-01-10 15:19:35	Nei	so, does this happen for you?
2013-01-10 15:19:40	seed419	sure it does

2013-01-10 15:20:11	Nei	so if I understand you correctly, it only pastes the first 9 lines and the 10th line is only shown in your input buffer?
2013-01-10 15:20:22	seed419	Nei: precisely
2013-01-10 15:20:37	Nei	then check your ctrl+j binding
2013-01-10 15:20:46	Nei	(alt_k ctrl+j)
2013-01-10 15:20:58	seed419	 /buffer +1   :)
2013-01-10 15:21:15	Nei	now we also know why it changes buffer
2013-01-10 15:21:29	Nei	weechat uses ctrl+j to send the final line of your paste
2013-01-10 15:21:35	seed419	why? lol
2013-01-10 15:21:53	seed419	I use C-j C-k for changing channels :/
2013-01-10 15:21:58	Nei	heh
2013-01-10 15:22:13	Nei	now what I'm saying is, personally I use the multiline script
2013-01-10 15:22:25	Nei	which will show the *whole* paste in my input buffer first
2013-01-10 15:22:34	Nei	so I think it might not have your issue at all
2013-01-10 15:22:48	seed419	Nei: not a bad idea...

2013-01-10 15:23:58	seed419	I never would have guessed that it would have used that binding as...essentially a carriage return
2013-01-10 15:24:13	seed419	but it is in a terminal for some reason
2013-01-10 15:24:21	seed419	that is so odd
2013-01-10 15:24:32	Nei	I think it is a weird thing of weechat's paste handling

2013-01-10 15:26:09	seed419	well C-y functions the same way in a readline terminal as it does in weechat
2013-01-10 15:26:26	seed419	I bet I could change the binding in ~/.inputrc
2013-01-10 15:26:34	Nei	weechat uses its own input handling
2013-01-10 15:26:36	Nei	afaik
2013-01-10 15:26:38	seed419	gah
2013-01-10 15:26:44	Nei	so it works purely through /key bind
2013-01-10 15:26:54	seed419	yeah it would, you're right...makes more sense
2013-01-10 15:26:57	Nei	it is just configured in a way so to emulate something you know

2013-01-10 15:33:57	seed419	it adds '!!' at the end of your input and delays for a bit

2013-01-10 18:28:34	@FlashCode	no, if you give '', it should be always the same buffer used, whatever the command is

2013-01-10 19:04:16	mumixam	hah*
2013-01-10 19:04:22	@FlashCode	anyway when you execute a command, you rarely *really* need to be on core buffer
2013-01-10 19:05:12	@FlashCode	and if you really need, you can still do: weechat.command(weechat.buffer_search_main(), '/something')
2013-01-10 19:06:04	mumixam	delete my bug report too
2013-01-10 19:07:26	Exio	weechat doesn't have any bug, it has features! :P
2013-01-10 19:08:07	mumixam	well looking at the source code
2013-01-10 19:08:12	mumixam	it seems the docs are just wrong

2013-01-10 19:22:19	nyuszika7h	FlashCode: hi, do I need to use weechat.command() with /server fakerecv to fake a kick when receiving a REMOVE message?
2013-01-10 19:22:43	nyuszika7h	or is there another way?
2013-01-10 19:22:49	@FlashCode	why do you need to do that?
2013-01-10 19:23:05	nyuszika7h	I just want the autorejoin to trigger (only for a few channels)
2013-01-10 19:23:19	+weebot	-git(core)- FlashCode: doc: fix buffer argument for function "command": NULL value means current buffer, not core buffer (bug #38057)
2013-01-10 19:23:39	nyuszika7h	so NULL != '' or what?
2013-01-10 19:24:00	@FlashCode	NULL is in C, in scripts you can use '', it's same as NULL
2013-01-10 19:24:20	@FlashCode	in a script, a pointer is sent as a string, an empty string is converted to NULL
2013-01-10 19:25:02	@FlashCode	nyuszika7h: you mean when you receive a REMOVE, there's no auto reconnection ?
2013-01-10 19:25:17	@FlashCode	autorejoin to chan I mean
2013-01-10 19:25:26	nyuszika7h	oh
2013-01-10 19:25:43	@FlashCode	and yes it's supposed to not rejoin on a REMOVE
2013-01-10 19:25:49	nyuszika7h	FlashCode: I know
2013-01-10 19:25:52	@FlashCode	the REMOVE means that you are really not welcome here :p
2013-01-10 19:25:57	@FlashCode	rejoining is a very bad idea
2013-01-10 19:26:02	nyuszika7h	for my own channels too?
2013-01-10 19:26:18	@FlashCode	then why remove and not kick?

2013-01-10 21:19:08	FiXato	Nei, is it possible to have spell_menu only trigger when you are positioned right after the word? In other words, have it only trigger on MisspeltWord [tab] and not on MisspeltWord nils[tab]?
2013-01-10 21:20:00	nils_2	i am currently working on a solution for this in spell_suggestion.py :p
2013-01-10 21:20:42	FiXato	 hehe, ok :)
2013-01-10 21:21:12	FiXato	please highlight me when you have it ready :)

2013-01-10 21:23:48	FiXato	in the mean time I remove the /input complete_next hook that's in spell_menu and just use a custom keybind for it :)

2013-01-10 21:25:08	FiXato	afaik your version of weechat should have access to the /script plugin :)

2013-01-10 21:27:21	vacuous	half the words are spelled incorrectly
2013-01-10 21:27:49	FiXato	vacuous, I kinda like it for words like oesophagus which I keep misspelling as esophagus
2013-01-10 21:28:12	FiXato	well, theoretically esophagus isn't incorrect, but I prefer British English spelling. :P
2013-01-10 21:28:12	nils_2	i bind "meta-q /spell_correction" and you can cycle through suggestions with the given command
2013-01-10 21:28:26	FiXato	ahh, I see
2013-01-10 21:28:32	FiXato	that would work I guess :)
2013-01-10 21:28:33	vacuous	oesophagus
2013-01-10 21:28:39	vacuous	doesn't even work
2013-01-10 21:28:47	nils_2	"meta-w /spell_correction replace" will replace the misspelled word
2013-01-10 21:28:56	vacuous	it's shown as incorrect spelling, lol
2013-01-10 21:29:00	FiXato	perhaps do /spell_correction next and /spell_correction previous instead
2013-01-10 21:29:11	vacuous	there's no point

2013-01-10 22:07:52	FiXato	well, or allow /ignore to hide instead of drop messages, so it can also be toggled like /filter
2013-01-10 22:07:57	@FlashCode	for example a "soft ignore" that would just add a tag to line, like "irc_ignored"
2013-01-10 22:08:00	@FlashCode	then you can filter

2013-01-10 22:09:05	swimmer	FlashCode: indeed to send the value on channel ...
2013-01-10 22:09:45	@FlashCode	swimmer: yes why not (and of course then restrict that to one option only, imagine the result with: /set -o weechat.* :D)
2013-01-10 22:10:25	@FlashCode	FiXato: to do that, the hostname should be added in each line
2013-01-10 22:10:35	@FlashCode	which would use some memory

2013-01-10 22:11:28	swimmer	of course *one* value only
2013-01-10 22:11:56	FiXato	yes, I know. But to a beginning user I think that having ignore *and* filter is confusing, especially since they kinda seem to fullfil the same purpose :)
2013-01-10 22:11:58	swimmer	it's just handy if I'm asked about an option
2013-01-10 22:12:24	@FlashCode	FiXato: not exactly, the ignored people are not logged into files, and not displayed at all
2013-01-10 22:12:44	grawity	hmmmm
2013-01-10 22:12:50	@FlashCode	swimmer: ok, I'll add that in next version
2013-01-10 22:12:52	nils_2	FlashCode: the rmodifier should work on /set -o weechat.* !!!!!
2013-01-10 22:13:01	grawity	but most messages would be coming from just a few people
2013-01-10 22:13:03	@FlashCode	rmodifier?
2013-01-10 22:13:19	nils_2	the plugin
2013-01-10 22:13:33	nils_2	/help rmodifier :p
2013-01-10 22:13:45	@FlashCode	the rmodifier to hide passwords?
2013-01-10 22:13:49	grawity	so if you had a way to keep a single copy of the hostname tag for all messages, it wouldn't use too much memory
2013-01-10 22:14:02	nils_2	yes. it should take effect on "/set -o"
2013-01-10 22:14:05	grawity	like atheme's strshare functions...
2013-01-10 22:14:14	@FlashCode	grawity: how would you do that?
2013-01-10 22:14:39	@FlashCode	ah I understand what you mean
2013-01-10 22:15:00	grawity	in Atheme services, the code keeps a central dictionary (a patricia structure, but an ordinary hashtable would do)
2013-01-10 22:15:11	@FlashCode	having for example hostnames stored in nicklist (currently they are not always known)
2013-01-10 22:15:26	@FlashCode	and then with a nick I can find hostname using nicklist
2013-01-10 22:15:34	nils_2	FlashCode: and a /set -o server.* will flood channel! maybe a max value should be given
2013-01-10 22:15:57	@FlashCode	nils_2: the "*" would of course not be allowed in /set -o ;)
2013-01-10 22:16:01	@FlashCode	only a single option
2013-01-10 22:16:04	grawity	FlashCode: here's their implementation https://github.com/atheme/atheme/blob/master/libathemecore/strshare.c
2013-01-10 22:16:37	nils_2	FlashCode: thats indeed a good idea (but with rmodifier, its a lot better :-)
2013-01-10 22:16:37	@FlashCode	grawity: I have hashtable structure in weechat, so store is not a problem
2013-01-10 22:16:53	@FlashCode	grawity: the only thing is that core must access data own by irc plugin
2013-01-10 22:17:02	@FlashCode	filters are in core, hostnames are in irc plugin
2013-01-10 22:17:19	grawity	and line tags are in core
2013-01-10 22:17:22	@FlashCode	but with nicklist it should be possible to get them
2013-01-10 22:18:02	grawity	are tags for each message stored as a single string, or as an array?
2013-01-10 22:18:37	grawity	on the second thought, that doesn't actually matter
2013-01-10 22:18:43	@FlashCode	array
2013-01-10 22:20:03	@FlashCode	I'll think about a solution to not store hostname on each line
2013-01-10 22:20:26	@FlashCode	using nicklist is not good in fact
2013-01-10 22:20:35	@FlashCode	because if nick quits, the hostname will be lost

2013-01-10 22:23:36	grawity	FlashCode: So maybe implement something like strshare and try to keep a single copy of all tags (maybe in irc, maybe in core)... I think it would actually reduce the current memory usage

2013-01-10 22:26:00	@FlashCode	such tags could be "shared" too
2013-01-10 22:26:12	grawity	yeah – it would apply to all tags

2013-01-11 16:12:13	roughnecks	swimmer: some bitlbee users are complaining too about facebook
2013-01-11 16:12:27	bel3atar	swimmer: it seems...
2013-01-11 16:12:46	bel3atar	jabber.py disconnects also
2013-01-11 16:12:55	bel3atar	silently
2013-01-11 16:13:10	Uranio	swimmer: any bitlbee problem always finnish in the auth with the facebook API
2013-01-11 16:14:39	swimmer	Uranio: it's not only bitlbee but also jabber.py ;-)
2013-01-11 16:15:27	roughnecks	it's facebook
2013-01-11 16:15:52	roughnecks	you have a chance to stop with it

2013-01-11 16:16:29	swimmer	won't happen ;-)
2013-01-11 16:19:03	kgb	.. it's neat to have Jabber in WeeChat (and IRC in Pidgin); but at the same time, it's a really stupid idea. ;$
2013-01-11 16:19:50	Nei	how so
2013-01-11 16:20:08	kgb	bc why do the cross-thingy, idk
2013-01-11 16:20:14	kgb	:)
2013-01-11 16:21:27	pbos	I want my pidgin in weechat, and throw that crap out of the window
2013-01-11 16:21:40	pbos	weechat's a good interface to whatever backend
2013-01-11 16:21:49	TheBrayn	use bitlbee
2013-01-11 16:22:11	pbos	that, or minbif, whenever I get around to it
2013-01-11 16:22:15	pbos	I'll do it and never look back
2013-01-11 16:22:41	Jonimus	eh I've tried to do it, but I still find pidgin to be a better interface for one on one comm
2013-01-11 16:23:10	kgb	pbos: it may as well be.. but one's for one thing and the other for another.. bugs, development - so much simpler to have it separate, for separate programs /or whatever
2013-01-11 16:23:12	pbos	imo they can be /query conversations
2013-01-11 16:23:35	pbos	kgb: Only if they add complexity to the implementation
2013-01-11 16:23:46	kgb	integrated == windows, apple... just pisses me off :D
2013-01-11 16:23:55	Jonimus	they can be, but the buddy list setup, among other things just doesn't work as well.
2013-01-11 16:24:02	kgb	pbos: well yeah.. we would need features ofc
2013-01-11 16:24:44	pbos	would be cool to do a plugin around libpurple
2013-01-11 16:25:11	pbos	which integrates better than I suspect the bitlbee user list does
2013-01-11 16:25:25	Uranio	how could I update only "the things" comming from the FlashTux repository?
2013-01-11 16:25:35	kgb	Uranio: what OS?
2013-01-11 16:25:42	pbos	Uranio: update apt, then apt-get install weechat?

2013-01-11 16:26:09	pbos	apt-get update && apt-get install weechat, I think should do it
2013-01-11 16:26:17	Uranio	pbos: I wanna update only from flashtux repo, no from the whole source.list
2013-01-11 16:26:40	kgb	Uranio: /etc/apt/sources.list.d/nesthib-weechat-quantal.list ..for example, on 12.10, using add-apt-repository
2013-01-11 16:26:49	kgb	neater than using/editing sources.list
2013-01-11 16:27:32	kgb	(plus add-apt-repository also takes care of the keys automatically)
2013-01-11 16:27:33	Uranio	I'm thinking that exist a parameter for choose a repo, how when you'll install from the backports
2013-01-11 16:27:51	Uranio	if I use: aptitude -parameter flashtux update
2013-01-11 16:27:54	kgb	Uranio: you can set the priority on repos if you have many.. but here it's not needed
2013-01-11 16:28:00	pbos	Uranio: googling said apt-get -t did something
2013-01-11 16:28:11	pbos	check man apt-get, or man aptitude, or google :)
2013-01-11 16:28:20	pbos	kgb: wants to update only one of the repositories in apt
2013-01-11 16:29:02	kgb	pbos: yea I'm just saying to use add-apt-repository instead of the other methods.. seems a little easier to keep track of when upgrading the OS and such

2013-01-11 16:29:30	Uranio	http://pastebin.com/04XVFAHy
2013-01-11 16:30:11	kgb	Uranio: no need to remove, unless it's really old.. but you can always apt-get purge weechat if you really feel the need -- which will remove ALL config
2013-01-11 16:30:54	kgb	uhh and you really shouldn't be using root xD
2013-01-11 16:30:59	Exio	apt-get purge doesn't remove configs in your home.
2013-01-11 16:31:20	kgb	Exio: I was pretty sure it did
2013-01-11 16:31:41	Uranio	kgb: for manage packages I prefer do it as root, because the normal user have not permission for do such thing
2013-01-11 16:31:41	dominikh	that wouldn't even make sense
2013-01-11 16:32:10	dominikh	purge most certainly doesn't touch anyone's home
2013-01-11 16:32:39	roughnecks	and you *have* to be root to install/remove packages
2013-01-11 16:33:15	kgb	sure you do, but to run terminal with root..

2013-01-11 16:54:42	Uranio	ok... still being annoying that the initial joining to channels is very abrupt
2013-01-11 16:55:32	mumixam	you join a channel it joins it
2013-01-11 16:55:36	mumixam	whats so abrupt?
2013-01-11 16:59:24	nils_2	maybe he means: /set irc.look.buffer_switch_autojoin off
2013-01-11 16:59:25	pbos	Uranio: that it switches to newly joined channels?
2013-01-11 16:59:33	pbos	yeah, sounds like it nils_2 :)
2013-01-11 16:59:53	nils_2	ninja'd?
2013-01-11 16:59:57	Uranio	when start weechat, it start to join to the autojoin configured channels, with my banwith is a process that expend 1 minut or more when weechat no respondo to nothing, some times peoples greeting and I can't reply
2013-01-11 17:00:11	Uranio	nils_2: I thinking that but is not what I really want
2013-01-11 17:00:16	Uranio	let me see...
2013-01-11 17:01:33	mumixam	default delay is 2seconds per 'action'
2013-01-11 17:02:03	mumixam	so your saying if you autojoin 20 channels at 1 channel per 2 seconds you have to wait 40 seconds before typing?
2013-01-11 17:02:24	mumixam	that makes sence anyway
2013-01-11 17:02:28	Uranio	mumixam: when you have a very VERY good thing , you starting to pretend it PERFECT
2013-01-11 17:02:31	Uranio	forgot it...
2013-01-11 17:02:54	mumixam	autojoin would execute all the joins at once
2013-01-11 17:03:09	mumixam	but weechat delays them to prevent flooding
2013-01-11 17:03:38	Uranio	another good thing would be, for example, a command that in the momment you type it on a channel, that channel is added to the autojoin list
2013-01-11 17:03:42	mumixam	the flood protection isnt ideal
2013-01-11 17:04:38	mumixam	Uranio: you can disable the flood protection
2013-01-11 17:04:39	nils_2	i uploaded a new version from spell_correction.py to my git. please rename item "aspell_correction" to "spell_correction". also some new options are added
2013-01-11 17:04:43	mumixam	or lower it to 1 second
2013-01-11 17:05:09	Uranio	mumixam: disabling?
2013-01-11 17:05:15	mumixam	irc.server_default.anti_flood_prio_high
2013-01-11 17:05:21	mumixam	it defaults to 2
2013-01-11 17:05:39	mumixam	meaning i can spam 5 lines in less than a second
2013-01-11 17:05:48	mumixam	but weechat delays each line by 2 seconds
2013-01-11 17:05:56	nils_2	FiXato: i am sorry. i disabled the dict display, there is a bug with aspell_dict in weechat.
2013-01-11 17:06:24	Uranio	mumixam: ok... I like it, come when happen not then, I have enough delay here
2013-01-11 17:06:41	Uranio	s/delay/lag/g
2013-01-11 17:06:50	mumixam	i think 1 second should be ok
2013-01-11 17:07:03	mumixam	most ircd's allow something like 512 bytes in 1 second
2013-01-11 17:07:09	mumixam	then start delaying
2013-01-11 17:07:41	Uranio	done...

2013-01-11 18:29:58	@FlashCode	once theme is installed, you don't need the script any more, so I don't see link between script and your colors :p

2013-01-11 19:43:29	Nei	the mouse binding is on @item(buffers)
2013-01-11 19:45:12	@FlashCode	ah no I was wrong, coordinates are computed only for horizontal filling IIRC

2013-01-11 19:46:05	@FlashCode	looks like it's related to columns_vertical, it works with columns_horizontal
2013-01-11 19:46:17	@FlashCode	I think it's just a translation problem for coordinates (to find column/line)

2013-01-11 21:55:55	nils_2	what do you want to filter?
2013-01-11 21:56:47	[20-100]	I tried /filter add nagiospam server.crans * *Client*

2013-01-11 22:13:38	gchristensen	Hi, Weechat is coloring all nicks starting with ZK_ as white, which happens to be everyone in one of my channels. Is it possible to force it to use different colors? How does the coloring algorithm work?
2013-01-11 22:14:20	xt	gchristensen: it's a hash function. Just try and increase the numbers of colors in use
2013-01-11 22:14:34	xt	you can use 256 different ones!
2013-01-11 22:15:45	gchristensen	can I just put in a 1..256?
2013-01-11 22:16:11	xt	wouldn't reccommend that

2013-01-11 22:23:37	gchristensen	Lumpio-: its a naming scheme I use. These are all nicks through bitlbee, and to keep the different companies grouped, I prefix them.
2013-01-11 22:23:56	Lumpio-	Or go in your server buffer (which I assume is merged by default) and Ctrl-X until the correct server is selected, then join
2013-01-11 22:24:09	Lumpio-	Or just switch to any channel on that network and then /join

2013-01-11 22:53:06	_`_	the weechat-dev pkgbuild on aur and the weechat-stable pkgbuild in abs has enough to cover all the interpreters

2013-01-11 22:54:48	_`_	you could 1) fetch the rpm.src and re package ot, 2) see if there's a new package, 3) build and package it yourself (and use checkinstall to cheat and create an rpm)
2013-01-11 22:54:51	swimmer	err script of course
2013-01-11 22:55:08	_`_	best options I can give you
2013-01-11 22:56:33	_`_	you could just build it and "install it locally" sure, but best to use your kage ager if you have one (although cmake seems pretty decent for removing/uninstalling as opposed other stuff)

2013-01-12 00:32:00	gchristensen	not in the nicklist, in the chat itself.
2013-01-12 00:32:33	gchristensen	there are five different people, and all their nicks next to their messages are the same blue.
2013-01-12 00:34:33	R1cochet	not sure then
2013-01-12 00:41:59	osse	gchristensen: if you have a 256-color terminal you can drastically increase the number of colors for nicks. make weechat look much nicer :)

2013-01-12 00:42:36	gchristensen	may I see your color list? I'd be down to do that, but anything I pick will be random to scattershot

2013-01-12 01:18:13	gchristensen	ah! I figured out a solution. Using the prefix "ZK_" caused them all to bethe same yellow, but using the prefix "ZK-" didn't cause that to happen.

2013-01-12 01:25:11	gchristensen	The Grand Solution to having them be unique was to add more colors. So I added a ton of more colors, and it didn't do the trick.

2013-01-12 01:47:55	legallic	I've been looking for how to change bar items
2013-01-12 01:48:07	legallic	my goal is to change where the user modes appear
2013-01-12 01:48:28	legallic	but apparently they are part of the item [input_prompt] (which is in the itemlist of the input bar)
2013-01-12 01:48:35	legallic	is there a way to change it ?

2013-01-12 01:49:24	R1cochet	try /help on that option
2013-01-12 01:49:57	R1cochet	also, the braces [] are not part of the item name. you can remove them if you like
2013-01-12 01:50:10	legallic	ah, right, good point
2013-01-12 01:50:34	R1cochet	ex: [time] = [04:49] whereas time = 04:49
2013-01-12 01:50:38	R1cochet	:)
2013-01-12 01:50:59	R1cochet	a "+" is to paste items together
2013-01-12 01:51:15	R1cochet	so as to appear as one item
2013-01-12 01:51:53	Exio	the thing i found for what you want legallic is irc.look.item_nick_modes, i didn't see any way for having the umodes in other item, anyway
2013-01-12 01:52:08	Exio	but i didn't*
2013-01-12 01:52:43	Exio	R1cochet: for what he wants the option is weechat.bar.input.items
2013-01-12 01:52:54	legallic	Exio: thanks i was more searching for something like that
2013-01-12 01:52:59	Exio	unless you have your nick in the status, but by default it is in the input
2013-01-12 01:53:21	legallic	yep that's input but I understood what R1cochet said anyway
2013-01-12 01:53:52	R1cochet	ohh sorry, didnt see he wanted it on input bar
2013-01-12 01:54:01	R1cochet	but yea, same rules apply
2013-01-12 01:54:10	legallic	to be exact, I want to move it *from* the input bar, *to* the status bar
2013-01-12 01:54:15	legallic	(as it looks on irssi)
2013-01-12 01:54:29	torque	I wonder why the bar items aren't more generic
2013-01-12 01:54:58	R1cochet	what do you mean by generic?
2013-01-12 01:55:14	StarWeaver	I think he means modular at a finer granularity
2013-01-12 01:55:15	legallic	so the option irc.look.item_nick_modes allow me to hide it in the input bar, but I won't see them anywhere in this case

2013-01-12 02:09:58	StarWeaver	Well, one thing you could do if you have a line to spare, is make your input bar taller (I use two lines), and possibly put a newline in the input bar's format string so that your input text goes under your name instead of right of them
2013-01-12 02:10:20	Exio	but well, i don't have many modes so i don't get it annoying, but in your case, no idea, maybe flashcode can look later and answer you, if not possible, just a feature request and wait
2013-01-12 02:10:36	Exio	StarWeaver: that is annoying when you are using a netbook, 1024x600 resolution
2013-01-12 02:11:09	StarWeaver	Exio, Hmm .. you could bind a key or alias to /set irc.look.item_nick_modes toggle
2013-01-12 02:11:23	legallic	StarWeaver: excellent idea thanks for the tip
2013-01-12 02:11:32	StarWeaver	Then flip it on and off like the filter :3

2013-01-12 02:24:48	R1cochet	this probably added some more color pairs

2013-01-12 02:27:53	ToeTag	Okay maybe I'm asking the wrong question

2013-01-12 02:28:19	ToeTag	The issue is that I have so many people in one channel with the same color
2013-01-12 02:28:37	Kabaka	colorize_nicks.py uses the colors WeeChat assigns to nicks
2013-01-12 02:28:56	Kabaka	Those colors are chosen from the weechat.color.chat_nick_colors setting based on a hash of the nick
2013-01-12 02:29:13	Kabaka	By default, that list doesn't include any of the 256 colors -- just the basic ones

2013-01-12 02:36:11	Kabaka	ToeTag: yeah, I am not really a fan of that
2013-01-12 02:36:16	pmo	R1cochet: im sure i have to make a new nicklist
2013-01-12 02:36:19	Kabaka	ToeTag: too much trouble to name all these colors
2013-01-12 02:36:29	pmo	like everything else had to be made from scratch R1cochet :)
2013-01-12 02:36:30	Kabaka	ToeTag: so I just opened /color, changed it to display term colors, and went by that
2013-01-12 02:36:39	R1cochet	pmo: delete the old one first. then create a new one with type root
2013-01-12 02:37:06	pmo	well i just do hidden on, just in case
2013-01-12 02:37:13	ToeTag	Kabaka: ahhh how did you do that last part "change it to display term colors"
2013-01-12 02:37:22	<--	legallic (~legallic@zamok.crans.org) has left #weechat ("WeeChat 0.3.9.2")
2013-01-12 02:37:34	Kabaka	ToeTag: alt-c, as it says in the buffer title
2013-01-12 02:37:48	pmo	i think its something like /bar add nicklist2 20 20 root or something
2013-01-12 02:38:08	Kabaka	Ah damn, my screen shots album on minus is full
2013-01-12 02:38:15	pmo	and the function of the nicklist
2013-01-12 02:38:41	pmo	i think its something like /bar add nicklist2 20 20 root buffer_nicklist
2013-01-12 02:38:43	ToeTag	Kabaka: ahhhh my terminal was too narrow to see that
2013-01-12 02:38:44	pmo	there
2013-01-12 02:39:11	ToeTag	DAMN it shows all /256 colors in the list when i do alt+c but the rest of weechat freaks out and goes black/white
2013-01-12 02:39:20	Kabaka	pmo: https://i.minus.com/iblEiHEmnO9BTV.png here is /names output in this channel
2013-01-12 02:39:27	Kabaka	ToeTag: yeah, that is what it is supposed to do
2013-01-12 02:39:32	Kabaka	ToeTag: it is just for reference
2013-01-12 02:39:50	Kabaka	ToeTag: WeeChat changes appearance like that because ncurses can only do 256 color pairs at one time, so it has to allocate all of them for that table
2013-01-12 02:39:53	pmo	Kabaka: oh thats JUST the colors i wanted! thank you :D
2013-01-12 02:40:03	Kabaka	pmo: no problem
2013-01-12 02:40:05	ToeTag	Kabaka: damnit! that's exactly what I want - just like your nicklist
2013-01-12 02:40:14	ToeTag	mine effectively only has ~10 colors
2013-01-12 02:40:16	Kabaka	pmo: it is basically all the colors, but I spaced them out so no two are too close together
2013-01-12 02:40:50	pmo	looks quite nice :)
2013-01-12 02:41:16	ToeTag	when I use my /set weechat.color.chat....... will that change be persistent
2013-01-12 02:41:22	Kabaka	ToeTag: if you /save
2013-01-12 02:41:33	Kabaka	ToeTag: or if you have the setting to save on quit set (and WeeChat exits gracefully)
2013-01-12 02:42:02	Kabaka	ToeTag: or if you have the confversion script, since I believe it saves on settings changes so it can commit it to git. :-P
2013-01-12 02:42:44	ToeTag	just send the command /save ?
2013-01-12 02:42:52	Kabaka	Yes
2013-01-12 02:42:52	ToeTag	That's why I was looking for a config file earlier
2013-01-12 02:42:57	ToeTag	ahh okay
2013-01-12 02:43:01	Kabaka	You shouldn't edit the config files yourself
2013-01-12 02:43:11	Kabaka	There isn't much error handling for malformed config entries
2013-01-12 02:43:23	Kabaka	So you are better off not taking that risk and just let WeeChat handle it
2013-01-12 02:43:31	pmo	this looks amazing
2013-01-12 02:43:51	ToeTag	Kabaka: good to know!
2013-01-12 02:43:57	ToeTag	pmo: You got yours working?
2013-01-12 02:44:02	pmo	yea :D
2013-01-12 02:44:03	ToeTag	Mine still sucks

2013-01-12 02:48:10	pmo	a thanks, i have that bookmarked in the windows partition ( that i dont use anymore ) just forgot about it
2013-01-12 02:48:24	ToeTag	Kabaka: wait. that might have been a ridiculous question
2013-01-12 02:48:51	Kabaka	ToeTag: yeah, like I just said, I went by the list of all 256 colors supported by my term and picked colors that were reasonably different
2013-01-12 02:49:28	Kabaka	The final list I just provided is slightly different, since I found a few that were too close together or too close to white
2013-01-12 02:49:35	Kabaka	But whatever :-P

2013-01-12 02:55:04	Kabaka	R1cochet: number

2013-01-12 02:57:20	R1cochet	you could create a second bar, give it a different name, and set item to topic

2013-01-12 02:58:18	pmo	easy to do
2013-01-12 02:58:27	R1cochet	dont know about windows. i doubt u can turn them off for windows. thats how you know which window you're in
2013-01-12 02:58:31	pmo	the main question is if i can add a bar of any kind to only one buffer

2013-01-12 03:00:27	pmo	let me take a screenshot and then explain
2013-01-12 03:00:48	R1cochet	you want a bar to display only in 1 window
2013-01-12 03:00:54	R1cochet	s/window/buffer/
2013-01-12 03:00:56	R1cochet	correct?
2013-01-12 03:01:42	pmo	http://i.imgur.com/82KZ7.png
2013-01-12 03:02:02	pmo	if you look at the top window.. i want a bar at the bottom
2013-01-12 03:02:47	pmo	and only that buffer (highmon)
2013-01-12 03:02:49	R1cochet	is the top a bar or buffer?
2013-01-12 03:03:08	pmo	buffer
2013-01-12 03:03:11	R1cochet	you can change highmon to bar, then add another bar below it
2013-01-12 03:03:25	pmo	hmm
2013-01-12 03:03:46	R1cochet	not sure if you can only have a bar displayed in a single window. again tho, that would be a condition setting if it's even possible
2013-01-12 03:03:51	pmo	so the entire buffer becomes a bar instead?
2013-01-12 03:03:57	R1cochet	im not sure if it is. i asked something similar before
2013-01-12 03:04:04	pmo	ah
2013-01-12 03:04:16	R1cochet	pmo: yes, you can change highmon output to bar instead of buffer
2013-01-12 03:04:34	pmo	another way it could be done, is if i could hide a bar in a single buffer too hehe
2013-01-12 03:04:35	R1cochet	which makes more sense imo since you cant send messages in that buffer anyways
2013-01-12 03:04:47	pmo	let me try

2013-01-12 03:06:59	pmo	if i change it to bar its gone
2013-01-12 03:07:02	pmo	hehe
2013-01-12 03:07:10	R1cochet	set hidden to off?
2013-01-12 03:07:22	pmo	its not on :)
2013-01-12 03:07:34	R1cochet	bar size?
2013-01-12 03:07:53	pmo	10
2013-01-12 03:08:37	R1cochet	this is highmon not chanmon correct?
2013-01-12 03:09:23	pmo	try highlight me?
2013-01-12 03:09:30	R1cochet	pmo:
2013-01-12 03:09:30	pmo	yea highmon
2013-01-12 03:09:35	pmo	once more
2013-01-12 03:09:52	R1cochet	pmo: once more
2013-01-12 03:09:59	pmo	ah it grows
2013-01-12 03:10:06	pmo	its root tho
2013-01-12 03:10:09	R1cochet	set max size
2013-01-12 03:10:10	pmo	need to set it to window
2013-01-12 03:10:13	pmo	and top
2013-01-12 03:10:16	R1cochet	no
2013-01-12 03:10:23	R1cochet	you dont need to set it to window
2013-01-12 03:10:32	R1cochet	set size and size_max
2013-01-12 03:10:42	R1cochet	then it wont grow
2013-01-12 03:10:53	R1cochet	one sec i have a screen for you
2013-01-12 03:11:25	pmo	i need it in between buffers and nicklist, and under title :)
2013-01-12 03:11:40	pmo	but bar makes sense, no need to have a channel open
2013-01-12 03:11:43	R1cochet	priority settings
2013-01-12 03:11:57	R1cochet	higher priority = drawn first

2013-01-12 03:12:29	R1cochet	that should do it
2013-01-12 03:12:40	R1cochet	or numbers similar
2013-01-12 03:12:40	pmo	its next to buffers, just need it next to nicklist now too :)

2013-01-12 03:13:48	R1cochet	so buffers position is left, and nicklist position is right and highmon position is top correct?

2013-01-12 03:14:36	R1cochet	so it should look the same yes?
2013-01-12 03:14:53	R1cochet	except the bar separator is showing
2013-01-12 03:15:06	pmo	almost the same :)
2013-01-12 03:15:08	pmo	a tad better :)
2013-01-12 03:15:28	pmo	tbh i like it to grow like this

2013-01-12 03:15:36	pmo	no*
2013-01-12 03:15:55	pmo	like when i clear it goes away etc :)
2013-01-12 03:15:55	R1cochet	aww ok
2013-01-12 03:16:12	R1cochet	well you should be able to make it static size and then bind some keys to scroll it :)
2013-01-12 03:16:18	pmo	if i can clear a bar, i will figure out :d

2013-01-12 03:29:26	swimmer	certainly because it was logsize.py which is even related to logfiles ;-)

2013-01-12 04:29:39	R1cochet	on/off for that would probably not be optimal. id have to read the script. but im thinking the option of "none" would be better

2013-01-12 11:34:20	Mike__	Hello. I have a question related to python scripting of weechat. I have read http://goo.gl/WVpLz, but I can't figure out, how to catch 'normal' messages sent to channels by users. I tried irc_in2_say, irc_in2_privmsg but with no results. I have looked through scripts hosted on weechat sites, but I can't find anything. Thank you for help, in advance!
2013-01-12 11:35:16	@FlashCode	Mike__: try "*,irc_in2_privmsg"
2013-01-12 11:35:22	@FlashCode	the * stands for "any server"
2013-01-12 11:35:41	@FlashCode	this should catch all user messages (including private messages) on all channels of all servers
2013-01-12 11:41:17	Dewr	help message of "irc.look.color_nicks_in_names" says that "use nick color in output of /names..." but it prints monotune text when I do "/names #.."
2013-01-12 11:41:45	Dewr	even I set this to 'on'
2013-01-12 11:42:11	Dewr	list of nicks displayed when joining a channel is colorful anyway
2013-01-12 11:42:22	 *	Dewr is using 0.3.9.2
2013-01-12 11:42:27	Mike__	FlashCode: I modified the code by you: http://pastebin.com/FCkaHUKb
2013-01-12 11:42:54	@FlashCode	Mike__: and it works?
2013-01-12 11:42:56	Mike__	But it doesn't works
2013-01-12 11:43:25	@FlashCode	are you sure the callback is not called at all? try a print at beginning of callback
2013-01-12 11:43:45	Nei	mumixam: as a workaround you can use substring/copy
2013-01-12 11:43:56	Nei	but I would also say this is some serious bug in weechat guile
2013-01-12 11:44:04	Dewr	well, it does print colorful text when I am joined the target channel of /names
2013-01-12 11:44:27	@FlashCode	Nei: yeah, I'm looking at strings in guile currently
2013-01-12 11:44:41	Nei	probably weechat ignores the string length property
2013-01-12 11:44:42	@FlashCode	there are 2 workarounds for the problem (waiting for a fix in guile):
2013-01-12 11:45:03	@FlashCode	or string-copy works
2013-01-12 11:45:11	@FlashCode	yes weechat uses scm_i_string_chars without length
2013-01-12 11:45:24	@FlashCode	so sometimes it returns full string instead of partial string
2013-01-12 11:45:30	@FlashCode	depending on guile function you used
2013-01-12 11:45:33	Nei	which will go boom on shared strings
2013-01-12 11:45:45	@FlashCode	I'll fix that in guile
2013-01-12 11:46:25	@FlashCode	Dewr: it works for me, are you sure you don't have a script that could cause this problem? try in a weechat without any script loaded
2013-01-12 11:47:00	@FlashCode	most of the time, such display problems with colors are caused by scripts
2013-01-12 11:48:39	Mike__	FlashCode: It look doesn't gets called ( http://pastebin.com/G5Evwdd0 ). The example code works fine ( the hooking of join messages ).
2013-01-12 11:48:48	Mike__	*looks
2013-01-12 12:03:44	Dewr	FlashCode: I was running with no scripts loaded
2013-01-12 12:04:04	Dewr	s/running/running weechat 0.3.9.2/
2013-01-12 12:04:17	Nei	maybe you have a misconception of what your script is supposed to do. what do you want to do, and how are you trying it to confirm that it works?
2013-01-12 12:06:26	kany	my cam's no longer workin can anybody help me one that one?
2013-01-12 12:16:14	@FlashCode	Mike__: a privmsg is not a join, a privmsg is a message from a user (to a channel or to your nick)
2013-01-12 12:16:37	Mike__	I know.
2013-01-12 12:16:45	Mike__	I need to catch privms

2013-01-12 12:16:48	@FlashCode	to catch joins, you must use "*,irc_in2_join"
2013-01-12 12:16:58	Mike__	As I said that works for me
2013-01-12 12:17:29	Mike__	But I want to catch privmsg, as you could see in the code that i posted.
2013-01-12 12:17:40	Mike__	But it don't works
2013-01-12 12:17:48	@FlashCode	ok I will try same script
2013-01-12 12:18:07	Nei	another common trap: privmsg is messages from others users, not from yourself.
2013-01-12 12:18:58	@FlashCode	yes, your privmsg is sent but weechat receives nothing
2013-01-12 12:19:12	@FlashCode	Mike__: your script works fine, the callback is called (there are errors in callback but that's another problem)
2013-01-12 12:19:36	@FlashCode	you can test with:  /query Mike__ test
2013-01-12 12:19:41	@FlashCode	with that you'll send and receive a message
2013-01-12 12:21:07	@FlashCode	Dewr: what are your nick colors?  /set weechat.color.chat_nick_colors

2013-01-12 13:09:46	@FlashCode	I planned to do that:  char *str = weechat_strndup (scm_i_string_chars(message), scm_i_string_length(message));
2013-01-12 13:10:20	@FlashCode	yes supporting guile 2 is another task :)
2013-01-12 13:10:25	@FlashCode	bbl
2013-01-12 13:11:29	Nei	I think it would be best to replace all _i with *locale calls

2013-01-12 14:24:02	nils_2_	have to ghost my nick again :-(
2013-01-12 14:24:18	--	nils_2_ is now known as nils_2
2013-01-12 14:30:00	FiXato	I kinda like the overview of all possibilities with Nei's script, however I'm not that fond of the dependency of the menu.pl script, especially with the main_menu forcing its display when the spell menu is triggered (or rather, when I press the wrong keys in it), as well as the help text menu.
2013-01-12 14:30:38	nils_2	FiXato: item aspell_suggest
2013-01-12 14:30:39	Nei	you can /set plugins.var.perl.menu.main_menu_hidden "on"
2013-01-12 14:30:43	FiXato	still have to try nils' script, but I expect I'll like the non-verbosity of it
2013-01-12 14:31:24	FiXato	Nei, I know, but it still seems to disable that setting when I do the wrong thing, like pressing backspace while in the spell_menu
2013-01-12 14:31:34	Nei	and /set plugins.var.perl.menu.active_help "off" (but Ctrl+h will still toggle it on and off)
2013-01-12 14:31:48	Nei	the main menu should remain hidden when you do the setting
2013-01-12 14:32:17	Nei	but unfortunately weechat has an /input that treats both ^H and backspace as the same, thats why backspace shows the help
2013-01-12 14:32:47	FiXato	actually, backspace doesn't show the help, but just the main menu
2013-01-12 14:32:57	Nei	that would be a bug :)
2013-01-12 14:33:24	FiXato	backspace is bound to ctrl-? /input delete_previous_char for me
2013-01-12 14:33:54	Nei	as is ctrl-H usually, and as most scripts intercept keys with an /input * handler
2013-01-12 14:34:05	Nei	delete_previous_char toggles the help bar
2013-01-12 14:34:11	Nei	well. should, anyway
2013-01-12 14:34:38	FiXato	also, I kinda miss an 'ignore' option in the list, apart from the add.
2013-01-12 14:34:44	Nei	heh
2013-01-12 14:34:46	Nei	I miss that too
2013-01-12 14:35:01	Nei	but there isn't one in the weechat api
2013-01-12 14:35:03	Nei	so no way
2013-01-12 14:36:09	FiXato	as well as the thing I mentioned earlier: spell_menu only being triggered if I press the completion button right after the misspelled word, and not anywhere in the input bar.
2013-01-12 14:36:29	Nei	that's why I said you might wanna check the dev script
2013-01-12 14:36:54	Nei	it has some settings like complete_near, complete_noend, that you might like
2013-01-12 14:37:02	nils_2	Nei: i downloaded latest version from spell_menu. when i have a misspelled word and the select menu is open i can choose a suggestion, but the text "ADD suggest" does not change
2013-01-12 14:37:11	FiXato	ah, settings, yes, forgot to check the new settings out :)

2013-01-12 14:46:52	Nei	sorry about this little inconvenience ;)
2013-01-12 14:47:04	Nei	adding settings means another init procedure and a settings hook

2013-01-12 14:48:48	Nei	no, that makes it too long and the menu looks ugly
2013-01-12 14:49:02	Nei	every char is precious!
2013-01-12 14:49:31	Nei	because weechat calculates the menu columns based on the longest string in any entry
2013-01-12 14:50:03	nils_2	i had to remove the word manually. i thought ADD means add to input
2013-01-12 14:50:03	FiXato	actually Nei, it toggles the help menu, but triggers the main_menu

2013-01-12 14:59:27	FiXato	Nei, is there also a key to press to cancel the spell menu?

2013-01-12 15:00:54	R1cochet	what happens if you're in a merged buffer?
2013-01-12 15:01:31	FiXato	R1cochet, then it only closes the spell menu

2013-01-12 15:02:01	FiXato	but asking you is much more fun!
2013-01-12 15:02:49	Nei	actually the headers should be bold, or at least the *no* / *en*

2013-01-12 16:47:53	nyuszika7h	yes, but I can't reproduce
2013-01-12 16:48:00	@FlashCode	ok
2013-01-12 16:48:06	@FlashCode	I have some info in your log
2013-01-12 16:48:15	@FlashCode	after the balance, one window became without a chat window inside
2013-01-12 16:48:27	@FlashCode	so it crashes when weechat tried to refresh the chat area in this window
2013-01-12 16:48:33	Nei	sounds funny
2013-01-12 16:48:35	@FlashCode	I hope I'll understand why the chat area is NULL
2013-01-12 16:48:50	nyuszika7h	I was on the core buffer, did a splith and resized the top window until it became the smallest possible size
2013-01-12 16:48:52	@FlashCode	nyuszika7h: how many windows did you have before balance ? many ?
2013-01-12 16:48:53	nyuszika7h	then tried to do the balance
2013-01-12 16:49:02	nyuszika7h	FlashCode: two windows, horizontally split
2013-01-12 16:49:20	@FlashCode	ok
2013-01-12 16:49:31	nyuszika7h	I was also messing with adding/removing rootinput/input bar before, if that counts
2013-01-12 16:49:51	@FlashCode	should not be related

2013-01-12 16:51:54	Nei	then you will need to rework the _i stuff in any case
2013-01-12 16:52:02	nyuszika7h	FlashCode: yes, top was smallest possible size, bottom filled the rest
2013-01-12 16:52:42	@FlashCode	Nei: yes, will do it
2013-01-12 16:53:07	@FlashCode	nyuszika7h: smallest? how did you that? (just trying to understand and reproduce)
2013-01-12 16:53:12	Nei	because the _i that gets you the wide unicode strings won't be very much compatible with the utf8 weechat needs
2013-01-12 16:53:12	nyuszika7h	FlashCode: /window resize -1
2013-01-12 16:53:13	nyuszika7h	a lot of times
2013-01-12 16:53:29	@FlashCode	ok that could explain
2013-01-12 16:53:38	@FlashCode	when window becomes too small, the chat area will be disabled I think
2013-01-12 16:53:48	@FlashCode	and a balance will increase size, but maybe not recreate the chat!
2013-01-12 16:54:33	@FlashCode	I got the crash :)

2013-01-12 17:12:53	Deltafire	none, i typed the following:
2013-01-12 17:12:58	Deltafire	/unload tcl
2013-01-12 17:13:00	Deltafire	/unload perl
2013-01-12 17:13:03	Deltafire	/load tcl
2013-01-12 17:13:06	Deltafire	<crash>
2013-01-12 17:13:09	swimmer	*wow* this is such a luxury!!!
2013-01-12 17:13:19	@FlashCode	you mean /plugin unload tcl ?
2013-01-12 17:13:25	Deltafire	yes, sorry

2013-01-12 17:14:23	@FlashCode	nyuszika7h: could you please file a bug for your crash? (if you don't have time I can do it)
2013-01-12 17:14:32	 *	swimmer is realizing how fine it is that the main developer of his new favourite chat program is available for chats, crash reports, suggestions and reacts immediately
2013-01-12 17:14:37	@FlashCode	Deltafire: ok, I'll try under freebsd then (I think I have version 9)
2013-01-12 17:14:42	 *	swimmer bows to FlashCode
2013-01-12 17:14:46	swimmer	thanks man
2013-01-12 17:14:49	@FlashCode	swimmer: :)
2013-01-12 17:14:58	nyuszika7h	FlashCode: I can in 10-20 mins
2013-01-12 17:15:02	@FlashCode	the support is as important as the software for me ;)
2013-01-12 17:15:19	swimmer	what a difference to the other widely used cli app
2013-01-12 17:15:39	Deltafire	that other client is pretty much dead, not actively updated
2013-01-12 17:16:08	nyuszika7h	irssi?
2013-01-12 17:16:17	Nei	irssi is finished
2013-01-12 17:16:34	@FlashCode	nyuszika7h: ok, and in bug please tell that you did many /window resize -1, then a /window balance (I think it's enough to reproduce)
2013-01-12 17:16:36	Nei	have you seen any irssi crash?
2013-01-12 17:16:43	nyuszika7h	ok
2013-01-12 17:17:03	nyuszika7h	Nei: not a crash, but weird chars in status window
2013-01-12 17:17:10	nyuszika7h	when doing /upgrade with SSL
2013-01-12 17:17:25	nyuszika7h	weechat disonnects cleanly when you do that
2013-01-12 17:18:27	Nei	neither one can keep em

2013-01-12 17:19:22	Nei	I don't get weird chars
2013-01-12 17:19:29	@FlashCode	Deltafire: for the bug with plugins unload/reload on freebsd, I think I have an idea
2013-01-12 17:19:42	@FlashCode	it's because the shared lib loaded is not really freed by freebsd when you unload
2013-01-12 17:19:52	@FlashCode	and then when reloading same plugin, it causes bugs I think
2013-01-12 17:19:59	nyuszika7h	17:18:35 -!- Restoring connection to irc.freenode.net
2013-01-12 17:19:59	nyuszika7h	17:18:35 -!- UA
2013-01-12 17:20:00	nyuszika7h	17:18:35 -!- Irssi: Connection lost to irc.freenode.net
2013-01-12 17:20:05	@FlashCode	it's something specific to freebsd I discovered some months ago
2013-01-12 17:20:05	nyuszika7h	the UA is in reverse
2013-01-12 17:20:31	Nei	I guess it is a bug ;) but to them it's just a minor display issue
2013-01-12 17:20:50	@FlashCode	Deltafire: and I have no easy way to fix :/
2013-01-12 17:20:59	@FlashCode	I think it's a bug in freebsd
2013-01-12 17:21:10	Nei	just claim it is not fixable and be done!
2013-01-12 17:21:26	@FlashCode	I'm not 100% sure, maybe some options could help when loading plugin
2013-01-12 17:21:36	Nei	sometimes it requires a lot of OS knowledge, like this dynamic lib loading stuff
2013-01-12 17:21:51	Nei	because that is rather os specific
2013-01-12 17:21:57	@FlashCode	yes
2013-01-12 17:22:05	@FlashCode	Deltafire: just don't play too much with /plugin load/unload :)

2013-01-12 17:22:54	@FlashCode	(not sure for other BSD though)
2013-01-12 17:23:05	Nei	FlashCode do you prioritise the feature requests and bugs or only on the "roadmap"?

2013-01-12 17:23:33	swimmer	sorry Nei - it was not my intention to blame irssi ... I'm just very happy with the activity around weechat B-)
2013-01-12 17:23:35	@FlashCode	Nei: I use roadmap yes for priorities (bugs & tasks are on roadmap)
2013-01-12 17:23:41	swimmer	also regarding the scripts ;-)
2013-01-12 17:23:52	Nei	python is everywhere these days
2013-01-12 17:24:19	Nei	irc scripting is easier with irssi imo, but weechat can do much more on the UI side
2013-01-12 17:24:53	jelly-home	some linux distros have python in the base install and no perl
2013-01-12 17:24:55	Deltafire	FlashCode: yeah, i remember you looking into it a year ago (or more) - it's not something that really affects me
2013-01-12 17:25:07	Deltafire	i think i only found it when i first started using weechat and was playing around
2013-01-12 17:25:11	_`_	jelly-home: like?

2013-01-12 17:25:35	jelly-home	_`_: can't remember... Fedora I think
2013-01-12 17:25:38	Nei	wouldn't know any sane distro that has no perl in base
2013-01-12 17:26:03	jelly-home	subsequently, any future RHEL will be the same
2013-01-12 17:26:06	_`_	gentoo even has it in their stage 3 tarbells
2013-01-12 17:26:21	_`_	but they stopped including py2 in favor of py3
2013-01-12 17:26:39	_`_	last I checked faildora does include perl, I could be wrong
2013-01-12 17:27:25	Nei	I still like perl :)
2013-01-12 17:27:32	_`_	perl :>
2013-01-12 17:28:52	Nei	FlashCode: do you think anyone will test the perl-script-load branch?
2013-01-12 17:29:03	Nei	I kinda have my doubts
2013-01-12 17:29:07	@FlashCode	I'm not sure :p
2013-01-12 17:29:34	@FlashCode	anyway, it will be merged after release (I'll not merge before release, even if people test it)
2013-01-12 17:29:54	Nei	most important is to have a good and stable release
2013-01-12 17:30:09	@FlashCode	I reverted two commits I made (including this one), thinking they were harmless, and I was wrong
2013-01-12 17:30:15	Nei	hehe
2013-01-12 17:30:32	Nei	that's because of your high standards of "stable" dev
2013-01-12 17:30:40	Nei	not always possible
2013-01-12 17:30:51	Nei	especially since you don't seem to run any unit and integration tests in weechat
2013-01-12 17:31:49	@FlashCode	yes, that's why instead I set a "feature freeze" period of about 2-3 weeks for each release (the -rcX versions)
2013-01-12 17:32:21	Nei	didn't you already start labelling it as rcX
2013-01-12 17:32:38	Nei	then you'd better stick to the freeze ;p

2013-01-12 17:35:16	Dekans	hmm 2 in a row
2013-01-12 17:37:11	ubergeek42	Dekans: it does sound like a network issue, sometimes it can take a few moments from when you press send to when it shows up.  If you have a computer handy, you can look at the '/relay raw' buffer to see if the messages are making it to weechat.  I'm not sure there's much I can do to help with it though
2013-01-12 17:37:41	Dekans	okay so no special setting ?
2013-01-12 17:37:42	Dekans	no prob
2013-01-12 17:38:07	Exio	ubergeek42: does the app have any way to only 'sync' some channels?
2013-01-12 17:39:10	ubergeek42	Exio: it only sync's channels you have open, plus highlights(I think)
2013-01-12 17:39:44	Exio	that is the problem, i have over 70 channels here
2013-01-12 17:40:14	ubergeek42	I meant open on the phone
2013-01-12 17:40:26	Exio	ah
2013-01-12 17:40:34	Exio	then my network is the laggy :P
2013-01-12 17:41:03	ubergeek42	I'd have to double check the code, but I'm almost positive thats how it works

2013-01-12 19:33:16	nyuszika7h	I tried, but it gave some "no group" error
2013-01-12 19:33:24	nyuszika7h	I have no idea :/
2013-01-12 19:33:33	@FlashCode	ah
2013-01-12 19:33:48	@FlashCode	I can do it, but it's strange
2013-01-12 19:34:17	@FlashCode	you were on weechat bugs page, right?
2013-01-12 19:35:27	@FlashCode	hmm in fact bug is not even needed, because it's a new problem in devel
2013-01-12 19:35:42	@FlashCode	it was introduced some weeks ago (I just tested, no such problem on 0.3.9.x)
2013-01-12 19:35:53	@FlashCode	so please don't file a bug
2013-01-12 19:40:45	@FlashCode	nyuszika7h: you'll have to find another bug in weechat, in order to test if you are able to file a bug ;)
2013-01-12 19:40:50	@FlashCode	good luck!
2013-01-12 19:41:03	nyuszika7h	lol

2013-01-12 22:04:41	ukebane	 /perl says beep is loaded
2013-01-12 22:05:47	ukebane	22:04:27  weechat     | perl scripts loaded:
2013-01-12 22:05:48	ukebane	22:04:27  weechat     |   beep v1.1 - Beep (terminal bell) and/or run command on
2013-01-12 22:05:50	ukebane	                      | highlight/private message or new DCC
2013-01-12 22:06:46	ukebane	it's the latest beep.pl off http://www.weechat.org/scripts/
2013-01-12 22:07:40	BullShark	when will weechat be 1.0 =)
2013-01-12 22:07:46	BullShark	or 1.0-dev
2013-01-12 22:08:28	BullShark	seems stable enough to me but wine took about 10 years to make it to 1.0
2013-01-12 22:08:59	@FlashCode	!roadmap :)

2013-01-12 22:09:42	BullShark	supybot?
2013-01-12 22:09:50	nils_2	BullShark: does the number makes any sense? so many open source software is < 1.0 :P
2013-01-12 22:10:42	BullShark	nils_2 -> it wouldn't change anything if the developers called it 0.0.3.9.2 or 1.0 really but still curious
2013-01-12 22:11:06	BullShark	probably some plans unimplemented if it's not called 1.0 yet
2013-01-12 22:11:21	nils_2	check out gparted :p
2013-01-12 22:12:04	BullShark	gparted needs lvm, raid, and luks support
2013-01-12 22:12:09	BullShark	mdadm raid
2013-01-12 22:12:15	BullShark	let me check it out
2013-01-12 22:12:16	nils_2	0.12.1 ;-)

2013-01-12 22:13:36	Ratler	Its just a number, who cares as long as the product deliver? *shrug*
2013-01-12 22:13:41	BullShark	FlashCode -> when you make it 1.0, might go on slashdot.org

2013-01-12 22:21:14	@FlashCode	done

2013-01-12 22:24:26	BullShark	nils_2 -> will you still use this instead of 0.4?
2013-01-12 22:24:38	BullShark	with 0.4 i mean
2013-01-12 22:24:52	BullShark	i am viewing the source now
2013-01-12 22:24:56	nils_2	don't understand
2013-01-12 22:25:24	BullShark	nils_2 -> 4.0 does spelling corrections/suggestions afaik, same as what the scripts provide

2013-01-12 22:26:09	nils_2	0.4.0-dev supports suggestions, no corrections

2013-01-13 00:13:08	R1cochet	yep
2013-01-13 00:13:16	R1cochet	so create a relay for clients to connect to

2013-01-13 00:14:37	ahuemer	cool. any hint on how?
2013-01-13 00:14:56	R1cochet	/set *away*
2013-01-13 00:15:00	R1cochet	look for weechat.color.nicklist_away
2013-01-13 00:15:14	ahuemer	thx, i'll take a lok
2013-01-13 00:15:28	BullShark	cjbarnes18 -> have you tried connecting to it on the server+ server port?
2013-01-13 00:15:34	BullShark	with /connect
2013-01-13 00:15:45	R1cochet	also, you will need to turn color nick in nicklist on

2013-01-13 00:15:53	R1cochet	i dont color nicks in nicklist myself

2013-01-13 00:25:41	R1cochet	in that order?
2013-01-13 00:26:41	R1cochet	can you explain how those are damaged?
2013-01-13 00:27:00	ahuemer	yes, although 7 and 8 are on their places. 7 should be 17 and 8 should be 18
2013-01-13 00:27:20	BullShark	cjbarnes18 -> i imagine it has some weechat specific things, not just exactly what it's receiving from irc server

2013-01-13 00:29:51	BullShark	cjbarnes18 -> according to /help relay, it says "weechat protocol"
2013-01-13 00:30:09	cjbarnes18	BullShark: it seems it isnt working, expects an IRC server...
2013-01-13 00:30:54	BullShark	cjbarnes18 -> would some of those example commands from /help relay be for the client

2013-01-13 00:36:33	R1cochet	ahuemer: what does /buffer say?
2013-01-13 00:36:40	R1cochet	it should list all the buffers and their numbers
2013-01-13 00:36:51	R1cochet	maybe if you gave us a screenshot it would help
2013-01-13 00:37:10	ahuemer	the output is correct
2013-01-13 00:37:44	ahuemer	the wrong numbers are corrected when i move to that buffer
2013-01-13 00:37:58	R1cochet	weird
2013-01-13 00:38:27	BullShark	ahuemer -> buffers are numbered in case you want to switch between them by number alt+# alt+j then ##
2013-01-13 00:38:56	BullShark	or i missed your question
2013-01-13 00:39:16	BullShark	ahuemer -> /buffer move

2013-01-13 00:55:01	R1cochet	Dekans: that is a weechat thing not android app thing
2013-01-13 00:55:22	R1cochet	the day change notice shows in every buffer in weechat. so the relay client will display what weechat says
2013-01-13 00:55:44	R1cochet	you can turn day change notice off if you like
2013-01-13 00:56:16	Dekans	R1cochet I may do it
2013-01-13 00:57:01	Dekans	but as the android app syncs on only some events, it could be ignored
2013-01-13 00:58:43	R1cochet	i guess so
2013-01-13 00:58:53	R1cochet	maybe file a feature request on his github
2013-01-13 00:59:03	R1cochet	but he is in school atm so dev has slowed down for now

2013-01-13 02:44:27	R1cochet	what?
2013-01-13 02:44:34	R1cochet	places where u add a number?
2013-01-13 02:44:49	pmo	number of lines.. 0 for unmilited 1 for 1, 2 for 2 etc
2013-01-13 02:44:54	pmo	would a -1 be valid?
2013-01-13 02:44:58	R1cochet	what are you looking at?
2013-01-13 02:45:17	pmo	tweaking the highmon bar :)
2013-01-13 02:45:22	R1cochet	oh lol
2013-01-13 02:45:33	R1cochet	dunno. try and find out. but i doubt it
2013-01-13 02:45:34	pmo	like it grows with number of lines
2013-01-13 02:45:42	pmo	but with 0 there will always be 1
2013-01-13 02:45:46	R1cochet	and i still dont know which option you are talking about
2013-01-13 02:45:54	R1cochet	0 = automatic
2013-01-13 02:45:57	pmo	yea
2013-01-13 02:46:06	R1cochet	and i still dont know which option you are talking about
2013-01-13 02:46:08	pmo	im more or less talking about all bar settings :)
2013-01-13 02:46:20	R1cochet	ok, well 0 = automatic sizing
2013-01-13 02:46:24	pmo	everywhere you can add max lines
2013-01-13 02:46:27	R1cochet	you can hide the bar if you want
2013-01-13 02:46:40	pmo	will the bar popup when there is text then? :)
2013-01-13 02:46:57	R1cochet	yes that means if there are 10 lines but you have max set to 5 only 5 most current will show
2013-01-13 02:47:02	pmo	i just figured out that 0 = minimum 1
2013-01-13 02:47:13	R1cochet	yep
2013-01-13 02:47:23	R1cochet	no, if its hidden i dont think it will auto popup
2013-01-13 02:47:31	R1cochet	you can always try tho
2013-01-13 02:47:33	pmo	highmon is set to a bar.. set to 0 7
2013-01-13 02:47:33	R1cochet	but i doubt it
2013-01-13 02:47:41	pmo	if i hide the bar its just gone hehe
2013-01-13 02:47:46	pmo	so that cant be done :P
2013-01-13 02:47:57	pmo	yea i should try hehe
2013-01-13 02:47:59	R1cochet	guess not
2013-01-13 02:48:01	R1cochet	dunno
2013-01-13 02:48:04	R1cochet	but i doubt it
2013-01-13 02:48:20	R1cochet	i find bars auto showing up or growing to be annoying myself
2013-01-13 02:48:32	R1cochet	i just set max size and keep them displayed
2013-01-13 02:49:49	pmo	well for me its just so there isent an huge empty bar :)
2013-01-13 02:50:04	pmo	so now when not used, there is just the chat window
2013-01-13 02:50:10	R1cochet	ok
2013-01-13 02:50:35	R1cochet	did you figure out the | separator?
2013-01-13 02:50:39	R1cochet	get it to disappear
2013-01-13 02:50:55	pmo	nope, its hardcoded into the script :)
2013-01-13 02:51:00	R1cochet	k
2013-01-13 02:51:02	R1cochet	shitty
2013-01-13 02:51:10	pmo	but i removed that bar between highmon and buffer now
2013-01-13 02:51:13	pmo	so its ok its there
2013-01-13 02:51:22	pmo	so i see a difference on highmon and chat :)
2013-01-13 02:51:29	R1cochet	nice
2013-01-13 02:52:05	pmo	but 0 is still minimum 1 here, but doesnt matter as much hehe
2013-01-13 02:52:14	pmo	you dont notice :)
2013-01-13 02:52:26	R1cochet	yes 0 = at least one
2013-01-13 02:52:31	R1cochet	you can always hide it
2013-01-13 02:52:53	pmo	but i dont want it perm hidden :p

2013-01-13 06:21:21	R1cochet	and then you can refine from there
2013-01-13 06:22:18	R1cochet	torque: you might be able to escape a comma by prepending it with a "\"
2013-01-13 06:22:45	R1cochet	so some\,string should match "some,string"
2013-01-13 06:23:15	R1cochet	but im not sure if that is the escape character for weechat regex, nor i am aware if you can even escape the comma at all

2013-01-13 12:54:20	grawity	and built-in things that need horrible scripts in irssi. :P

2013-01-13 12:55:19	grawity	I made an irssi script for 'server-time'. It has to set timestamp_format to a static time, print the line, then reset timestamp_format back.

2013-01-13 12:56:54	Mahmoud	oh aspell by default. i had a perl script doing it for irssi
2013-01-13 12:57:23	Mahmoud	Nei: my life is a bit too short and the FOSS community spoiled me with their efficient support that beats all non-FOSS support contracts
2013-01-13 12:57:24	@FlashCode	Mahmoud: some minor things like powerful /ignore, netsplit detection
2013-01-13 12:57:49	Deltafire	message levels.. i used to use those in irssi to redirect certain messages to a common buffer

2013-01-13 12:58:53	Zucca	Is there any script that would create an url bar that shows VISIBLE urls on the current buffer only? I mean - if I scroll up the urls would change according what URLs are visible.
2013-01-13 12:58:54	@FlashCode	I'll add to roadmap for 0.4.1
2013-01-13 12:58:57	Deltafire	what is multi-prefix?
2013-01-13 12:59:06	Mahmoud	Deltafire++
2013-01-13 12:59:15	Nei	it means the client knows all the modes that a user has
2013-01-13 12:59:26	Nei	e.g. @+Deltafire <-- Deltafire has +o and +v
2013-01-13 12:59:33	Deltafire	i see
2013-01-13 12:59:36	grawity	...instead of only knowing the highest mode
2013-01-13 12:59:55	Nei	that's been in irssi and mIRC for decades, I think
2013-01-13 13:00:04	Mahmoud	Nei: what could irssi do once it knows all the modes that i have?
2013-01-13 13:00:08	Nei	there are even serveral ways to *get* this information from irc server
2013-01-13 13:00:09	swimmer	in-program configuration
2013-01-13 13:00:25	Nei	namesx, whox, and this new "capab" crap
2013-01-13 13:00:28	Nei	and maybe even more
2013-01-13 13:00:51	Nei	Mahmoud: if you are a channel operator it might be important for you to know that you not only need to -o a user but also -h him
2013-01-13 13:00:52	grawity	c2s "capab" is old crap from dancer/hyperion

2013-01-13 13:01:00	grawity	"CAP" is the new cool thing
2013-01-13 13:01:09	Nei	same crap new name
2013-01-13 13:01:14	grawity	CAP isn't crap
2013-01-13 13:01:19	Zucca	FlashCode: You could also add a feature to give more modes to users (/op, /voice) than just maximum of three (if more than three execute another /mode command automatically).
2013-01-13 13:01:24	Nei	although cap is supported by ircu and the irc steering committee at least
2013-01-13 13:01:39	grawity	"IRC steering committee"? That exists?
2013-01-13 13:01:42	Nei	I still claim 005 is sufficient
2013-01-13 13:01:48	Mahmoud	Nei: how does irssi present such info to the channel operator?
2013-01-13 13:02:16	Nei	well if you -o the user it will be apparent in the cached /n that the user still has +h, for example
2013-01-13 13:02:18	grawity	Mahmoud: Imagine joining a channel where I have both +o and +v. With multi-prefix, irssi will see me as "@+grawity", and without multi-prefix, only as "@grawity"
2013-01-13 13:02:35	Mahmoud	oh
2013-01-13 13:02:40	Mahmoud	that seems a trivial thing
2013-01-13 13:02:51	grawity	Mahmoud: If I get deopped, with multi-prefix irssi will start showing me as "+grawity" (still with voice), but without multi-prefix, irssi wouldn't know I have voice and would show me as just "grawity"
2013-01-13 13:03:31	Mahmoud	grawity: how about weechat?
2013-01-13 13:03:32	grawity	Mahmoud: So different people would see different statuses for the same person in their nicklists.
2013-01-13 13:03:54	grawity	Mahmoud: weechat doesn't support multi-prefix yet (FlashCode says it'll be in 0.4.1)
2013-01-13 13:04:01	swimmer	nils_2: ok thank you - new script is installed and 'most_recent' configured ... I'll see how it works ... ;-)
2013-01-13 13:04:10	grawity	Nei: 005 is not sufficient for things that change the protocol.
2013-01-13 13:04:44	grawity	Nei: btw, https://gist.github.com/3106111
2013-01-13 13:05:29	Mahmoud	grawity: i.e. weechat still might present different statuses depending on when an individual joined a channel?
2013-01-13 13:05:39	Nei	grawity: that is just you and some people claiming so
2013-01-13 13:05:42	grawity	Mahmoud: yes
2013-01-13 13:06:10	grawity	Nei: this is *just* you claiming otherwise
2013-01-13 13:06:53	Mahmoud	sounds like a must have (although it also seems a minor thing)
2013-01-13 13:07:08	Nei	grawity: you can always use 005 to introduce new commands and/or the protoctl hint
2013-01-13 13:07:24	Nei	which will come down to the same effect as the bloated CAP negotiation
2013-01-13 13:07:39	Nei	but you can also fix the thing by introducing new alternate commands
2013-01-13 13:07:47	Nei	and that way not breaking old clients

2013-01-13 13:09:55	Nei	certainly there should be a way to turn on and off features
2013-01-13 13:10:19	grawity	which is what CAP has
2013-01-13 13:10:22	grawity	cap req away-notify
2013-01-13 13:10:25	grawity	cap req -away-notify
2013-01-13 13:10:33	Nei	not that protoctl couldn't have it
2013-01-13 13:10:37	Mahmoud	when weechat is compiled with "spell", should i also compile it with (say) "-linguas_BR"?
2013-01-13 13:10:51	Nei	or that you could just have another *command* which does what you need, eg /away-notify on/off
2013-01-13 13:11:12	nils_2	swimmer: just have a look in your newsbar :p
2013-01-13 13:11:20	grawity	Nei: and then you bloat the ircd with dozens of commands that only flip a single bit each
2013-01-13 13:11:31	nils_2	swimmer: it should also scroll down.
2013-01-13 13:11:36	swimmer	nils_2: it has to be filled still ;-)

2013-01-13 13:12:11	swimmer	aiiii sweet! 'most_recent = last' is sooo sweet B-)
2013-01-13 13:12:15	@FlashCode	and then weechat can use them
2013-01-13 13:12:42	swimmer	nils_2: it's configured for 4 but I'll increase it temporarily ...
2013-01-13 13:13:16	Nei	Zucca: I don't know about urlbars but my coords script will take a snapshot from the current visible window and highlight the urls therein
2013-01-13 13:13:44	nils_2	swimmer: please test it. the lines will *not* be replaced when you change most_recent from "last" to "first" and visa verse. cause the lines will not be stored, only printed
2013-01-13 13:14:14	Zucca	Nei: Can you still copy long urls that way?
2013-01-13 13:14:30	swimmer	nils_2: good to know
2013-01-13 13:14:47	nils_2	if you are using time stamp you'll see
2013-01-13 13:15:03	grawity	FlashCode: and for the roadmap of 0.4.2 or 0.4.3, maybe away-notify (instead of WHO polling) & "last-spoken-to" tab-completion sorting
2013-01-13 13:15:04	swimmer	nils_2: but the quantity off displayed lines will change?
2013-01-13 13:15:04	Nei	Zucca: what OS are you using?
2013-01-13 13:15:18	grawity	really, having "last-spoken-to" tab-completion is the best thing about irssi
2013-01-13 13:15:22	Nei	which networks do away-notify?
2013-01-13 13:15:27	Nei	sounds like a prime spy feature

2013-01-13 13:18:17	Zucca	I'll test it now anyways.
2013-01-13 13:18:22	Nei	not in every case, if the url is broken into pieces then the rectangle selection doesn't catch it very well

2013-01-13 13:24:13	Zucca	Nei: Oh well. I think that's a bit too complicated way when it's possible to have simplier. I have urlserver already so I'm managing my url selections via it. :) I need to see if I can tweak urlbar a bit...

2013-01-13 13:25:53	Nei	grawity: just to give you an example, a "namesx" equivalent has long been supported by ircu through whox extension, which doesn't break old clients, syntax is just /who #channel %nf
2013-01-13 13:26:18	Nei	not everything has to break/change the protocol, some issues can be solved by additions to it
2013-01-13 13:26:43	grawity	yes, but "/who #channel %nf" requires the same list of nicks to be sent *twice*
2013-01-13 13:26:56	grawity	imagine that for 10-20 large channels on initial join.
2013-01-13 13:27:06	Nei	most clients do the /who syncing anyway for better /kickban support
2013-01-13 13:27:15	Nei	and then there is UHNAMES extension etc pp
2013-01-13 13:27:24	Mahmoud	in weechat conf, i have a list of nick names in `nicks = "nickname1, nickname2...etc"`. is this some sort of global thing that i'd better change on per-server basis?
2013-01-13 13:28:01	Nei	so you can save the double transmission of nicks, but that's about it
2013-01-13 13:28:25	@FlashCode	Mahmoud: you should read quickstart (yes you have server_default values (global), and you can override them if needed in a specific server)
2013-01-13 13:28:33	grawity	(tbh, a better place for your complaints would be #ircv3 or #atheme on staticbox)
2013-01-13 13:29:47	grawity	Nei: you can twist the protocol in many kinds of ways, but they'll always remain inefficient at best.
2013-01-13 13:30:01	Nei	so it's all pointless in the end
2013-01-13 13:30:25	grawity	Check if somebody logged in to services? Poll WHOX. Check if somebody in the nicklist went away or back? Poll WHOX. Check if somebody has @%+? Poll WHOX. Check somebody's real name? Poll WHOX.
2013-01-13 13:30:29	Zucca	Nei: As I do. urlbar would be perfect if it could update when switching buffer. Anyway this isn't that big problem as I use urlserver for now. :) Thanks.
2013-01-13 13:30:33	grawity	Yes, *your* suggestions are pointless.

2013-01-13 13:31:57	Nei	and what is the point of including  real name on join xD?
2013-01-13 13:32:58	grawity	Some clients display it. (By polling WHO or sending WHOIS for every new user, in fact.)
2013-01-13 13:33:09	Nei	you could also encode service status in the hostmask without breaking lot
2013-01-13 13:33:25	grawity	but then you'd break clients that rely on the hostmask being a ... hostmask.
2013-01-13 13:33:26	Mahmoud	assuming that there is an error in the config, should weechat by default tell me that something in the .ini-style config files is not making good-enough sense?
2013-01-13 13:33:41	Nei	these days hostmasks are rarely resolvable to a real ip anyway
2013-01-13 13:33:59	Nei	and you can also use the username field if you care about that
2013-01-13 13:34:13	Nei	look at freenode they've been abusing the host for a long time
2013-01-13 13:34:38	grawity	what I'm saying is, there's a lot of functionality that was "glued on" to the existing RFC 1459 protocol, which can be implemented much more efficiently by *updating* that protocol
2013-01-13 13:34:39	Mahmoud	weechat is fast..
2013-01-13 13:34:41	Nei	deliberately breaking it making it not even resemble a host
2013-01-13 13:35:24	 *	grawity once set "grawity/is/cool.example.com" as his rDNS. Freenode was fixed real fast afterwards :D
2013-01-13 13:36:33	Nei	if these days users think it important to know who is away, maybe as you say it is necessary to add push notifications

2013-01-13 13:37:51	grawity	see PSYC for example
2013-01-13 13:38:05	Nei	even psyc has an irc bridge

2013-01-13 13:38:13	grawity	and an XMPP one
2013-01-13 13:38:15	Nei	irssi does it fine
2013-01-13 13:38:24	Nei	at least last time I checked it was quite unusable
2013-01-13 13:38:38	grawity	hm, unusable how?
2013-01-13 13:39:15	Nei	I think it was breaking on full uris and also some case mapping
2013-01-13 13:39:54	grawity	but IRC is kind of like Unix – it was never bad enough for a complete replacement to gain popularity (as SysV vs Plan9), but it's poor enough for a new version to be created
2013-01-13 13:40:34	grawity	Nei: hm, no, Weechat even handles XMPP "nicks" (xmpp:grawity@foo!grawity@foo → xmpp:grawity@foo), which is surprising
2013-01-13 13:42:15	Nei	maybe it was just the weechat builtin nicklist offending me
2013-01-13 13:42:42	grawity	it does make the nicklist a bit too wide

2013-01-13 14:02:09	Mahmoud	oh like /win n in irssi
2013-01-13 14:03:05	grawity	you might like the buffers script (/script install buffers.pl)
2013-01-13 14:03:22	Mahmoud	hmm /buffer close == /win close?
2013-01-13 14:04:08	@FlashCode	Mahmoud: http://weechat.org/files/doc/weechat_faq.en.html#buffer_vs_window
2013-01-13 14:04:22	Mahmoud	thx.
2013-01-13 14:06:39	Mahmoud	can i make the ctrl+n/p non-cycling?

2013-01-13 14:13:10	Mahmoud	problem is, when i press ctrl+n, it keeps cycling throughout all of the buffers. it would be nice if such key combination would eventually saturate at the left-most buffer
2013-01-13 14:13:45	Nei	different people have different preferences
2013-01-13 14:13:57	Mahmoud	can i adjust it to fit my preferences?
2013-01-13 14:14:03	Nei	I'd claim most are happy with a wrap around
2013-01-13 14:14:04	Mahmoud	i.e. saturated ctrl+n
2013-01-13 14:14:46	Mahmoud	the nice thing about saturation is that i can press ctrl+n, sleep, and after a few seconds wake up and see it at the leftmost buffer
2013-01-13 14:15:05	grawity	which is the same as ctrl+1, no?
2013-01-13 14:15:20	Mahmoud	alt+1?
2013-01-13 14:15:25	grawity	yeah, that

2013-01-13 14:15:43	Mahmoud	yeah, problem solved for leftmost saturation. how, how about rightmost saturation
2013-01-13 14:15:50	grawity	alt+1, ctrl+p
2013-01-13 14:16:12	Mahmoud	you mean alt+1, ctrl+n
2013-01-13 14:16:16	Nei	why the hell you would care about going to the last buffer is of course another mystery :D
2013-01-13 14:16:25	Mahmoud	lol
2013-01-13 14:16:28	grawity	no, I mean alt+1, ctrl+p
2013-01-13 14:16:34	grawity	so that it wraps around to the last buffer
2013-01-13 14:16:44	Mahmoud	but ctrl+p would go to buffer 2
2013-01-13 14:16:53	grawity	no, p is "previous"

2013-01-13 14:17:46	Mahmoud	right. what i wanted is going to the right-most buffer. i.e. if 99 is the last one, then 99 is the one
2013-01-13 14:18:16	Nei	so if you do what grawity says you will end up just there
2013-01-13 14:19:12	Mahmoud	imo i should do atl+1, then ctrl+n since ctrl+n will wrap around from down to the right-most buffer (i.e. to the largest buffer)
2013-01-13 14:19:33	grawity	why would ctrl+n wrap around?
2013-01-13 14:19:40	grawity	it goes *next*, as in *forwards*
2013-01-13 14:19:43	Nei	ctrl+n will wrap to the NEXT buffer, which is 1 + 1 - 2
2013-01-13 14:19:45	Mahmoud	it is already wraping around
2013-01-13 14:20:04	grawity	97 | 98 | 99 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4
2013-01-13 14:20:13	Nei	maybe you should just try it
2013-01-13 14:20:14	grawity	if you're at 1, then you need the previous buffer

2013-01-13 14:21:43	grawity	no, "p" is for "previous" and "n" is for "next"

2013-01-13 14:22:30	grawity	no
2013-01-13 14:22:37	grawity	they both order buffers in the same order.

2013-01-13 14:27:11	grawity	but surely /AaronToponce/ shouldn't match "Aaron"?
2013-01-13 14:27:21	Nei	it shouldn't. what about the highlight_regex
2013-01-13 14:27:25	eightyeight	yet, it matches "\<Aaron\>" and "\<aaron\>"

2013-01-13 14:30:46	eightyeight	ah. there it is. indeed
2013-01-13 14:30:54	Nei	so how did it end up there?
2013-01-13 14:30:56	eightyeight	this is coming from the bitlbee server, where my nick is 'aaron'
2013-01-13 14:31:16	eightyeight	irc.bitlbee.&bitlbee: (str) highlight_words = $nick
2013-01-13 14:31:30	Nei	it's default to highlight your nick
2013-01-13 14:31:52	Nei	but unless aaron is in your bitlbee channels
2013-01-13 14:32:13	Nei	you shouldn't be highlighted (in my expecting)
2013-01-13 14:33:17	eightyeight	it's the twitter channel in bitlbee where the highlights are occuring. so, it makes sense

2013-01-13 22:23:01	pmo	seems like the | is hardcorded into highmon as bar mode
2013-01-13 22:23:14	KenjiE20	probably, you never actually mentioned before now what you wanted done :p

2013-01-13 22:24:24	KenjiE20	you can also just add an issue on github :p
2013-01-13 22:24:38	pmo	did know you were on github hehe
2013-01-13 22:24:48	pmo	also im not so sure its an "issue" or "bug" :P
2013-01-13 22:24:55	KenjiE20	I think it's in the script, don't remember

2013-01-13 22:26:09	KenjiE20	I think that was hardcoded when I originally made it
2013-01-13 22:26:13	pmo	yea that would work hehe
2013-01-13 22:26:51	KenjiE20	drop it on github and I'll get around to it
2013-01-13 22:26:52	pmo	if you just swap it to pickup the weechat one all should be fixed :)
2013-01-13 22:27:47	KenjiE20	you can file it on either chanmon or highmon, since they share the core, they'll both get it

2013-01-14 02:02:46	pmo	and fixed
2013-01-14 02:02:55	pmo	just had to restart weechat
2013-01-14 02:02:58	pmo	all seems to work now
2013-01-14 02:06:10	swimmer	and now *all* communication to #blowfish is encrypted?
2013-01-14 02:12:33	pmo	i did my own channel, but yes
2013-01-14 02:12:37	pmo	everything works :)
2013-01-14 02:12:52	pmo	would just be nice with a /blowkey on/off
2013-01-14 02:13:02	pmo	but im doing 2 aliases for it
2013-01-14 02:13:19	pmo	has to remove the channel to disable
2013-01-14 02:13:24	pmo	then add the channel to add it again
2013-01-14 02:13:43	pmo	i think im gonna alias it to /blowfish on and /blowfish off
2013-01-14 02:14:32	FiXato	why such long aliases?
2013-01-14 02:17:10	pmo	why not? :)
2013-01-14 02:17:32	pmo	im aliasing all /blowkey to /fish too
2013-01-14 02:17:48	pmo	i guess i could do a /fish on/off
2013-01-14 02:18:11	pmo	right now im just laughing at the guys on xchat and irssi
2013-01-14 02:18:14	pmo	they cant diable it :P
2013-01-14 02:18:19	pmo	disable*

2013-01-14 12:29:12	pmo	yea wheezy
2013-01-14 12:29:25	@FlashCode	ok, I'll rebuild, please wait
2013-01-14 12:29:38	pmo	ok thanks :), when done i have another question for you
2013-01-14 12:30:03	@FlashCode	you can ask while it's building ;)
2013-01-14 12:30:39	pmo	ok, do you have a rasberry pi ?
2013-01-14 12:31:51	@FlashCode	no
2013-01-14 12:32:10	pmo	if you got one for free, would do do a repo for it?
2013-01-14 12:32:25	pmo	its debian arm
2013-01-14 12:32:40	@FlashCode	armel ?

2013-01-14 12:34:07	@FlashCode	I looked recently how to cross-compile packages in debian
2013-01-14 12:34:24	@FlashCode	so I think I can build such packages without raspberry (but I'll not be able to test them of course)
2013-01-14 12:34:39	@FlashCode	I mean debian arch is armel I think ?

2013-01-14 12:42:30	pmo	if not for weechat, then to play with :)
2013-01-14 12:43:15	@FlashCode	thanks, donation of money or hardware to test is of course useful for me
2013-01-14 12:44:24	pmo	yea :)
2013-01-14 12:45:45	pmo	btw if you want to test mips you can do it very cheap.. like 10 euro
2013-01-14 12:46:33	pmo	get an old (supported) router with usb.. hook usb stick up to it.. install openwrt, and tada.. a headless mips server :P
2013-01-14 12:47:02	pmo	its for routers ofc, but you dont need to use it as a router :)
2013-01-14 12:47:13	@FlashCode	I have a linksys router with openwrt inside, I could install weechat here?
2013-01-14 12:47:23	pmo	yup
2013-01-14 12:47:30	pmo	might take some work, but yes :)
2013-01-14 12:47:40	pmo	just remember to add screen :)
2013-01-14 12:47:49	@FlashCode	I should try then, when I have some time
2013-01-14 12:47:58	pmo	its fun play :D
2013-01-14 12:48:15	@FlashCode	once I'll have setup cross-compilation for debian packages, I think I should be able to easily compile for any debian arch
2013-01-14 12:48:21	pmo	when you try, then pm me and i will give you all the repo's you need :)
2013-01-14 12:48:41	pmo	that would be really nice :)

2013-01-15 09:24:18	jelly-home	they had to create a slightly different ABI but they still call it armhf even tho it's not compatible with what Debian calls armhf
2013-01-15 09:24:21	pmo	i know there are users in here that have a rpi to hel test
2013-01-15 09:24:34	pmo	oh not?
2013-01-15 09:24:56	pmo	i guess they compiled the rpi weechat packages on another distro?
2013-01-15 09:24:58	jelly-home	raspbian is fully rebuilt specifically for rpi
2013-01-15 09:25:12	pmo	yes but where are the packages compiled?
2013-01-15 09:25:24	jelly-home	I guess they have their own buildds
2013-01-15 09:25:32	pmo	of?
2013-01-15 09:25:39	jelly-home	of?
2013-01-15 09:26:00	pmo	they have a box somewhere that compiles the packages that then go onto rpi
2013-01-15 09:26:04	jelly-home	yes
2013-01-15 09:26:14	pmo	thats what we are aiming for

2013-01-15 10:32:06	@FlashCode	someone is running debian/armhf here (so not raspberry) ? (to test my packages)
2013-01-15 10:32:23	pmo	i only have mips, sorry

2013-01-15 10:32:46	@FlashCode	it's quite fast to build such chroot
2013-01-15 10:32:50	pmo	doesnt even have to be tested :P
2013-01-15 10:33:03	@FlashCode	pmo: I want to test that my packages are valid

2013-01-15 10:33:25	pmo	you can try send me a mips package
2013-01-15 10:33:26	@FlashCode	on any arch different from amd64/i386 (which is already OK)
2013-01-15 10:33:33	pmo	i just need it in .ipk
2013-01-15 10:33:44	@FlashCode	hmm .ipk I don't know what it is :p
2013-01-15 10:33:55	@FlashCode	you can't install .deb files manually ?
2013-01-15 10:33:58	pmo	the packages for my mips devices :P
2013-01-15 10:33:59	@FlashCode	with dpkg -i
2013-01-15 10:34:11	pmo	not on my devices, its basic linux
2013-01-15 10:34:26	@FlashCode	ok, so I'll not test mips for now ;)
2013-01-15 10:34:26	pmo	cant run debian on it
2013-01-15 10:34:38	@FlashCode	I want to test with debian users
2013-01-15 10:34:42	pmo	yea
2013-01-15 10:35:01	pmo	i guess you could ask in the rpi channel here on freenode

2013-01-15 10:35:59	@FlashCode	I just want to test a cross-compiled package (I did not install raspberry tools)
2013-01-15 10:36:02	pmo	just a armhf box

2013-01-15 12:06:50	Mahmoud	can i change shortcut mappings? for example, instead of alt+n, i'd like it to be space+n
2013-01-15 12:07:49	@FlashCode	you shouldn't use space as a modifier
2013-01-15 12:07:57	@FlashCode	because it's a key to insert a char in command line
2013-01-15 12:08:06	@FlashCode	use only ctrl/meta
2013-01-15 12:08:23	@FlashCode	and yes, you can add/remove/change all bindings
2013-01-15 12:08:46	Mahmoud	does it mean when space is a modifier, it will lose its ability to write space char?
2013-01-15 12:08:55	@FlashCode	yes
2013-01-15 12:09:14	Mahmoud	so i guess shift is the same as it will lose it ability to do caps-on stuff\
2013-01-15 12:09:20	@FlashCode	you should not use any letter or common char as in a key

2013-01-15 12:09:51	Mahmoud	i'm finding it hard to press alt+n
2013-01-15 12:09:54	@FlashCode	shift is not used as-is in keys, but it changes the key after
2013-01-15 12:10:06	@FlashCode	for example meta-n = alt+n, meta-N = alt+shift+n (alt+N)
2013-01-15 12:10:47	R1cochet	are you with only one hand?
2013-01-15 12:10:51	R1cochet	serious question
2013-01-15 12:11:38	Mahmoud	no. two hands. but a malfunctioning brain.
2013-01-15 12:12:03	Mahmoud	how would you press alt + (say) 1?
2013-01-15 12:12:32	@FlashCode	depends on keyboard and if you have a keypad or not
2013-01-15 12:12:35	Mahmoud	my brain currently says: left left hand, use press alt via thumb, then 1 by any finger (could be index, or middle figure)
2013-01-15 12:12:37	R1cochet	left thumb on alt middle finger on 1
2013-01-15 12:12:45	R1cochet	but i have large hands
2013-01-15 12:12:47	@FlashCode	on my azerty without keypad, it's alt + shift + &   (& and 1 are on same key)
2013-01-15 12:12:48	Mahmoud	oh. similar then. i find that annoying
2013-01-15 12:13:04	R1cochet	i dont place hands on kb like ur supposed to
2013-01-15 12:13:15	R1cochet	i taught myself to type

2013-01-15 12:14:34	Mahmoud	i position my fingers on the home row. but then fall-back to an exceptional case where i left left-hand, then do the magic as you do
2013-01-15 12:14:43	R1cochet	sure i use it to align but im all over the place
2013-01-15 12:14:48	Mahmoud	s/left left-hand/lift left hand/
2013-01-15 12:14:53	R1cochet	i dont use pinky fingers
2013-01-15 12:15:16	Mahmoud	i think it could have been better if the space was tiner in the middle and surrounded by alt/ctrl/shift instead of doing all these dancings

2013-01-15 18:24:10	pmo	i need to stop using znc.. does screen or tmux work the best with weechat?
2013-01-15 18:24:22	pmo	i have heard too mixed opinions
2013-01-15 18:24:33	pmo	in my mine they would both be around the same
2013-01-15 18:25:00	ubergeek42	Rasi: ssh is setup on the host, not in the weechat relay settings
2013-01-15 18:25:07	tmr	screen and tmux? There are differences.
2013-01-15 18:25:17	Rasi	ubergeek42: i dont get it
2013-01-15 18:25:24	Rasi	weechat opens its own port for relays anyway
2013-01-15 18:25:35	Rasi	so why does that weechat android app have ssh options
2013-01-15 18:25:44	FiXato	pmo, I have had no issues with either, but I'm sticking to tmux whenever it is available to me. :)

2013-01-15 18:27:15	ubergeek42	for various reasons: some people don't want to(or can't) open an additional port; some people may prefer the security of ssh over weechat's own ssl implementation
2013-01-15 18:27:39	ubergeek42	there's no requirement to use it, so it exists merely as an option for those who are interested
2013-01-15 18:29:49	pmo	tmr, im asking if there are differences related to weechat
2013-01-15 18:30:31	pmo	FiXato, im personally used to screen
2013-01-15 18:30:38	Rasi	ubergeek42: hmm i have to try it
2013-01-15 18:30:45	pmo	so i should prob stick with that if there arent differences
2013-01-15 18:30:58	pmo	i just dont like the bar in tmux or screen
2013-01-15 18:31:03	pmo	but thats an easy fix hehe
2013-01-15 18:31:43	KenjiE20	tmux has a nicer config imo
2013-01-15 18:33:12	pmo	config for what?
2013-01-15 18:33:58	pmo	(being curious, not negative)
2013-01-15 18:34:37	Rasi	meh
2013-01-15 18:34:45	Rasi	the app shows no file dialog for the private key
2013-01-15 18:34:48	Rasi	file
2013-01-15 18:35:54	Rasi	anyway, doesnt work... (local port cannot be bound)

2013-01-15 18:37:07	pmo	thanks :)
2013-01-15 18:37:28	ubergeek42	Rasi: there's no file dialog because as far as I know, there is no "android way" to do that
2013-01-15 18:38:38	pmo	ok i will give tmux a go FiXato :)
2013-01-15 18:38:51	FiXato	:)
2013-01-15 18:39:06	ubergeek42	Rasi: errors like that are usually just a configuration issue(The app is still in progress/beta); if your key is larger than 1024bits it probably won't work(and give that error)
2013-01-15 18:39:10	FiXato	only issue I have with tmux atm is that it doesn't show underlined text in weechat
2013-01-15 18:39:18	FiXato	but I think I had the same issue in Screen
2013-01-15 18:39:36	init	i had more issues with tmux
2013-01-15 18:39:42	FiXato	probably some termcap thing, which I can't really be bothered figuring out

2013-01-15 18:42:10	pmo	FiXato, i dont really use underlined text
2013-01-15 18:42:33	pmo	in fact i got znc to stip colors and such
2013-01-15 18:42:40	pmo	strip

2013-01-15 18:42:54	pmo	but i will have to change that when i move away from znc
2013-01-15 18:43:11	FiXato	isn't there a script for it?
2013-01-15 18:43:21	pmo	most likely
2013-01-15 18:43:25	pmo	if not built in
2013-01-15 18:43:34	init	then you will start using /prism every line, no? :P

2013-01-15 18:44:13	FiXato	but I guess the +c strips colours at this channel

2013-01-15 18:46:25	pmo	*this* should still be bold right?
2013-01-15 18:46:34	FiXato	nope pmo
2013-01-15 18:46:40	Mkaysi	It's not

2013-01-15 18:48:03	FiXato	then again, the only device on which I really could use mosh, is a mobile phone that still runs Windows Mobile 6.5 and thus has no mosh support at all

2013-01-16 07:57:09	kernelPiCNic	Hello, using weechat-curses, is there a way for my client to run certain commands at specific intervals, like, ping for example? cos, if my net connection stays idle, the lag increases..

2013-01-16 08:00:33	kernelPiCNic	what?
2013-01-16 08:00:44	torque	irc automatically sends regular pings to your client, which responds to them
2013-01-16 08:01:04	torque	you can use `/server raw` to see what's happening under the hood
2013-01-16 08:01:07	kernelPiCNic	my net disconnects if it stays idle for too long, is there a way for my client to constantly ping or something at specific intervals?
2013-01-16 08:01:13	StarWeaver	just check /server raw

2013-01-16 08:01:36	torque	the connection should be constantly pinging already
2013-01-16 08:01:43	torque	since that's how the server knows you still exist
2013-01-16 08:01:58	kernelPiCNic	is there a way to increase that interval?
2013-01-16 08:02:40	torque	I don't know

2013-01-16 08:03:12	torque	(also, I had it backwards: your client pings the server, which responds)
2013-01-16 08:03:15	Ratler	normally the ping occur every 60-120 sdconds
2013-01-16 08:03:19	TheBrayn	you'll get a ping from the server and have to respond to it with pong
2013-01-16 08:03:24	Ratler	seconds*

2013-01-16 12:24:50	quiznilo	can't find it in the docs
2013-01-16 12:24:58	@FlashCode	quiznilo: which script?
2013-01-16 12:25:02	quiznilo	urlbar
2013-01-16 12:25:11	@FlashCode	if you have iset.pl installed, try /iset urlbar
2013-01-16 12:25:19	R1cochet	quiznilo: yes
2013-01-16 12:25:22	R1cochet	which options?
2013-01-16 12:25:29	Nei	otherwise /set *urlbar* to see them
2013-01-16 12:25:44	R1cochet	its own config file or plugin.var file?
2013-01-16 12:25:54	quiznilo	option "urlbar" not found
2013-01-16 12:26:00	R1cochet	plugin.var is easier to start with and recommended if not very many options
2013-01-16 12:26:14	Nei	quiznilo: /Iset, notice the I
2013-01-16 12:26:15	@FlashCode	quiznilo: you tried with the stars around?
2013-01-16 12:26:22	R1cochet	otherwise for scripts with tons of options id go with a config file

2013-01-16 13:30:37	FiXato	thanks Nei :)
2013-01-16 13:31:09	FiXato	now I wonder why mosh doesn't support xterm mouse, while it did yesterday on this server. Strange...
2013-01-16 13:31:28	Nei	last time I checked mosh doesn't support mouse
2013-01-16 13:31:50	FiXato	yes, so it said. And on another server mouse support didn't work either under mosh
2013-01-16 13:32:04	FiXato	but when I tried it on this server last night, it apparently did work
2013-01-16 13:32:13	Nei	maybe you called ssh instead of mosh
2013-01-16 13:32:43	FiXato	nope, pretty certain I used mosh as I did see the underlining of local echo that mosh uses
2013-01-16 13:33:03	Nei	maybe you were just seeing your terminal's mouse
2013-01-16 13:33:18	FiXato	what do you mean?
2013-01-16 13:33:49	Nei	I mean you were just using your terminal's built in mouse feature
2013-01-16 13:34:13	FiXato	I'm using the same terminal
2013-01-16 13:36:13	R1cochet	FlashCode sorry just saw your message about script look. you still need screnshot? Nei's is accurate. i can take one also if needed

2013-01-16 13:46:44	Nei	what works and what doesn't and how don't you get why?
2013-01-16 13:47:14	Nei	for example to check the mouse, see if you can click on buffers in buffers.pl
2013-01-16 13:47:16	FiXato	if I first start up an SSH session, and go into my tmux session and then disconnect my network while tmux is still on screen, reconnect my network and start a mosh session in the same terminal instead, mouse support works
2013-01-16 13:47:50	FiXato	well, yes, not being able to click on buffers in buffers.pl is what I count under 'mouse support not working' :P
2013-01-16 13:48:04	Nei	so you can click on buffers through mosh?
2013-01-16 13:49:24	FiXato	normally not, but if I use that workaround I can. What is the echo string I need to send to initiate mouse mode in a shell?

2013-01-16 13:49:45	FiXato	I want to see if enabling mouse mode in the shell before starting mosh does the trick
2013-01-16 13:50:10	Nei	so the solution to this mystery is that mosh will pass through mouse control codes, but it will block mouse request codes from programs running inside mosh
2013-01-16 13:50:27	FiXato	that is what I am assuming yeah
2013-01-16 13:50:46	Nei	so you can just do this to globally enable mouse reporting in your terminal: perl -E ' print "\e[?1005h\e[?1002h" '
2013-01-16 13:50:50	Nei	before starting mosh
2013-01-16 13:51:19	FiX	hurrah! that does the trick :D
2013-01-16 13:51:37	Nei	bad hack xD
2013-01-16 13:51:41	FiX	Mkaysi, I bet you would like that too :D
2013-01-16 13:51:46	FiX	hehe, yeah
2013-01-16 13:52:02	FiX	I'll post this on the mouse support topic of mosh too; see if they can use it :)
2013-01-16 13:53:25	FiX	1005 is the extended mouse mode, right?
2013-01-16 13:53:36	Nei	1005 is the utf8 mouse mode
2013-01-16 13:53:36	@FlashCode	R1cochet: no that's ok
2013-01-16 13:54:03	Nei	you will get breakage around column 170 without it
2013-01-16 13:56:28	FiXato	ah yes, I remember having that issue.
2013-01-16 13:56:35	R1cochet	can i resubmit? wasnt allowed earlier
2013-01-16 13:56:47	Nei	R1cochet: resubmit is not implemented in the website
2013-01-16 13:56:50	FiXato	I wonder if switching from screen to tmux fixed that issue for me without really noticing :P
2013-01-16 13:56:57	Nei	you have to get FlashCode to delete the script from there first
2013-01-16 13:57:08	R1cochet	Nei \e escape char?

2013-01-16 13:58:43	FiXato	FlashCode, have you considered moving the scripts repository to github and allowing people to just use pull requests to update scripts and add new scripts?
2013-01-16 13:59:38	@FlashCode	R1cochet: please send me new version by mail

2013-01-16 14:01:51	R1cochet	maybe*

2013-01-16 14:02:55	TheBrayn	FlashCode: yes that would be one part of the question

2013-01-16 14:05:05	TheBrayn	FlashCode: then how could I propose changes for scripts?
2013-01-16 14:05:22	TheBrayn	I understand your motivation
2013-01-16 14:05:27	@FlashCode	TheBrayn: you have a form here: http://weechat.org/scripts/update/
2013-01-16 14:06:08	TheBrayn	FlashCode: do you have any statistics about the number of times people have entered “yes” in the “Are you a spammer?” field?
2013-01-16 14:06:13	R1cochet	TheBrayn sorry meant weechat.bar.title.separator
2013-01-16 14:06:27	FiXato	FlashCode, but isn't the beauty of git-based platforms that you don't need to exclusively use one of them?
2013-01-16 14:06:33	@FlashCode	TheBrayn: probably same number of people who submitted a script update ;)
2013-01-16 14:06:49	R1cochet	you can turn it off completely.  if thats the line you mean.
2013-01-16 14:07:32	dominikh	FiXato: there's a difference between having a mirror of your git repository, and managing stuff like bug reports
2013-01-16 14:07:35	@FlashCode	FiXato: it has nothing to do with github features (or similar sites)
2013-01-16 14:07:40	dominikh	FiXato: splitting the latter across multiple platforms is silly
2013-01-16 14:08:31	R1cochet	TheBrayn you can add changes to scripts and submit as update
2013-01-16 14:08:33	TheBrayn	Option changed: weechat.look.separator_horizontal = "♥" <- this didn't seem to work
2013-01-16 14:09:02	R1cochet	use a spade :)
2013-01-16 14:09:08	TheBrayn	one separator changes to the normal line and the other changes to │
2013-01-16 14:09:24	@FlashCode	TheBrayn: wide chars are not allowed in this option
2013-01-16 14:09:26	TheBrayn	doesn't work either :P
2013-01-16 14:09:29	TheBrayn	ok
2013-01-16 14:09:43	TheBrayn	does that mean that only ascii symbols are allowed?
2013-01-16 14:09:44	@FlashCode	at least wide on screen I think
2013-01-16 14:09:56	@FlashCode	multi-byte UTF-8 chars with one char on screen should be ok (not sure though)
2013-01-16 14:10:02	TheBrayn	shouldn't they all be the same with monospace?
2013-01-16 14:10:27	FiXato	I'm not talking about bug reports (though I personally don't like savannah's interface at all), but currently the managing of script updates isn't done on savannah either. Ah well, never mind :)

2013-01-16 15:28:07	giulivo	I really want weechat to use NO COLORS at all
2013-01-16 15:28:28	giulivo	or just to chose myself what should be colorized
2013-01-16 15:28:42	giulivo	any hint on this?
2013-01-16 15:28:46	@FlashCode	giulivo: there's no option to just disable all colors, but you can change all colors options if needed
2013-01-16 15:29:15	giulivo	FlashCode: thanks for that but it looks like there are really a lot of color options
2013-01-16 15:29:46	giulivo	can I filter those options somehow with a sed or something similar?
2013-01-16 15:29:56	@FlashCode	you can browser them with iset.pl
2013-01-16 15:30:04	@FlashCode	so you'll see list in a buffer, with help on top for each option
2013-01-16 15:30:33	@FlashCode	like that: http://weechat.org/screenshots/weechat_2011-07-05_flashcode.png/

2013-01-17 10:23:42	grawity	If you have `certtool` from GnuTLS utilities, do `certtool -i < foo.pem` and `certtool -k < foo.pem` display the correct information, or do they complain about the format?

2013-01-17 17:17:03	kelnoky	maybe not -.-
2013-01-17 17:17:12	kelnoky	havent updated those scrips in a while now that you mention it
2013-01-17 17:17:15	kelnoky	gonna do that now
2013-01-17 17:17:18	@FlashCode	v0.7
2013-01-17 17:17:37	Nei	its because of change in weechat
2013-01-17 17:17:40	@FlashCode	a (security) bug has been fixed in weechat which needs this script to be updated
2013-01-17 17:17:54	Nei	try /script update; /script upgrade
2013-01-17 17:18:02	@FlashCode	and btw it's good idea to use latest versions of scripts
2013-01-17 17:18:11	@FlashCode	for stability/security
2013-01-17 17:18:25	kelnoky	yeh, naturally
2013-01-17 17:18:31	kelnoky	it just always works, so I forget about it
2013-01-17 17:18:43	kelnoky	updating weechat scrips should be done by pacman :p
2013-01-17 17:18:56	Nei	scripts are user-local
2013-01-17 17:19:08	WakiMiko	i just had weechat crash twice while using the mouse in the iset buffer
2013-01-17 17:19:14	Nei	nice
2013-01-17 17:19:22	Nei	maybe a bug in iset script
2013-01-17 17:19:33	Nei	if possible try to make a reproducible receipe
2013-01-17 17:19:37	@FlashCode	I had in mind to add a notification in script plugin (optional) for outdated scripts
2013-01-17 17:19:43	WakiMiko	one time it just froze, the other time i got a segfault
2013-01-17 17:19:58	Nei	i.e type /iset, click here and there, and then it crashes (exact description how to make it crash always)
2013-01-17 17:20:19	Nei	well, if you manage to come up with such a description, that is the biggest help aside from fixing the bug itself
2013-01-17 17:20:32	Nei	if you have a segfault and enabled core files that can also be helpful
2013-01-17 17:20:33	WakiMiko	yeah ill try that in a seperate instance
2013-01-17 17:20:35	@FlashCode	WakiMiko: do you have latest iset btw?

2013-01-17 17:52:50	WakiMiko	also, sometimes there appears a "wrong" line in the iset buffer

2013-01-17 19:00:30	Hermit	hi. I've just installed the urlserver plugin, successfully set it up (host, port, allowed ips), but it's not capturing any link whatsoever. What could be the problem? (the server is running, /urlserver status says so too, and there's even the urlserver buffer open)

2013-01-17 19:00:47	TheBrayn	it really seemed to be the nameserver

2013-01-17 19:01:12	osse	when I start weechat 0.3.9.2 with a clean config on arch I get "Error: unable to load plugin "/usr/lib/weechat/plugins/guile.so": libguile.so.17: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory. If you're trying to load a script and not a C plugin (...)" and equivalent messages for tcl, lua, ruby and aspell. Are these messages harmless?

2013-01-17 19:02:17	Hermit	aww, damn, I've just found out urlserver doesn't work for weechat < 0.3.4
2013-01-17 19:02:35	Hermit	the script should refuse to load on this version
2013-01-17 19:04:57	Deltafire	osse: just means you don't have guile installed - it's nothing to worry about, unless you plan on running guile scripts (and afaik there are none on the weechat repository)
2013-01-17 19:06:18	osse	Deltafire: maybe I'll submit a patch to make the message look less menacing :) Thanks. Both perl and python are loaded and that takes care of the plugins I've used so far
2013-01-17 19:07:04	FiXato	it's odd it tries to load it though; I would say it wouldn't try to load plugins that weren't installed
2013-01-17 19:07:14	Deltafire	you could delete the corrosponding plugins (the .so files in the plugins directory) and the messages will dissapear
2013-01-17 19:08:21	FiXato	or disable the plugin in the autoload: /set weechat.plugin.autoload "*,!guile"
2013-01-17 19:09:24	osse	FiXato: good idea! thanks
2013-01-17 19:10:26	osse	brilliant! That took care of it
2013-01-17 19:11:03	FiXato	but I agree with Deltafire that it would be better to remove the cause of the problem by deleting the actual so file :)

2013-01-17 20:44:44	v1adimir	/set irc.server.freenode.password is for the network password, eye know that much ;)
2013-01-17 20:45:17	DrSlony	what about channel key?
2013-01-17 20:45:23	v1adimir	DrSlony: probably you would have to include it in irc.server.freenode.command
2013-01-17 20:45:26	v1adimir	i'm guessing
2013-01-17 20:45:32	DrSlony	how?
2013-01-17 20:45:32	dominikh	description: comma separated list of channels to join when connected to server (example: "#chan1,#chan2,#chan3 key1,key2")
2013-01-17 20:45:45	dominikh	that already gives you an example with keys :)
2013-01-17 20:46:07	v1adimir	dominikh: which 1 is that?
2013-01-17 20:46:25	dominikh	the irc.server.<foo>.autojoin setting
2013-01-17 20:47:04	dominikh	comma-separated list of channels (those requiring keys first), comma-separated list of keys, separated by a space.
2013-01-17 20:47:22	DrSlony	dominikh i dont get it, what does key2 pertain to?
2013-01-17 20:47:34	DrSlony	looks like key1 is for chan3
2013-01-17 20:47:37	v1adimir	oh pretty cool
2013-01-17 20:47:46	dominikh	key1 is for chan1, key2 is for chan2, chan3 does not require a key.
2013-01-17 20:47:51	DrSlony	ok
2013-01-17 20:48:03	DrSlony	unintuitive format
2013-01-17 20:48:22	v1adimir	nah, it's fine ;)
2013-01-17 20:48:41	DrSlony	its fine once you know it, but it really is unintuitive
2013-01-17 20:48:42	dominikh	it's the same format you use in /join
2013-01-17 20:48:55	dominikh	and it's documented in the help of the setting..
2013-01-17 20:50:35	nils_2	and its the format the server is using, its not a weechat format
2013-01-17 20:50:44	DrSlony	so /set irc.server.freenode.autojoin "#foo bar"
2013-01-17 20:50:46	DrSlony	correct?
2013-01-17 20:51:45	MrElendig	yes
2013-01-17 20:51:50	nils_2	looks good, yes
2013-01-17 20:52:30	MrElendig	"#pass1,#pass2,#nopass,#pass3 pass1,pass2,pass3"  if you have more than one
2013-01-17 20:53:14	dominikh	MrElendig: uhm, don't all those with a password have to come first?
2013-01-17 20:53:34	nils_2	isn't key protected channels first MrElendig ? #pass1,#pass2,#pass3,#nopass pass1,pass2,pass3
2013-01-17 20:53:42	MrElendig	bha yea, typo
2013-01-17 20:53:50	MrElendig	silly broken brain/finger interface

2013-01-17 21:26:39	roaet	Hallo! Is it possible to reorder windows so F7/F8 go in a different order?
2013-01-17 21:27:37	grawity	/buffer move
2013-01-17 21:28:21	monty	is there a similar shortcut similar to "alt+s" but switching in order the buffers' number? (for example, if there are new messages in 1, 3, 4, 5, 8, then it would switch in that exact order)
2013-01-17 21:28:28	monty	-similar
2013-01-17 21:29:06	roaet	grawity: that doesn't seem to do what i'm looking for :(
2013-01-17 21:32:32	roaet	I'll just merge them back and forth until I figure out the splith/v order

2013-01-17 22:11:28	tr3buchet	ah
2013-01-17 22:11:44	nils_2	hdata() is a bit more complex then infolist_get()
2013-01-17 22:12:20	nils_2	you should install script infolist.py. its very useful if you want to code a script
2013-01-17 22:14:20	@FlashCode	tr3buchet: you can not get easily output of a command

2013-01-18 06:42:22	torque	well, the regex pattern to ignore a character is e.g. [^f]
2013-01-18 06:42:31	torque	otherwise ^ indicates line start
2013-01-18 06:44:10	torque	but since it's inside [], it will match any of the contained characters

2013-01-18 06:47:36	torque	I'm not sure what the best solution for you is. [^<rf/]{3}$nick should catch those 2 cases but will obviously also catch a lot more (any 3-character combination of those 4 characters prepending your nick, in fact)

2013-01-18 06:59:31	torque	I'm not sure how the highlighting options overlap with each other

2013-01-18 07:02:29	torque	in the end, I think it's probably possible to write a regular expression that would work, but it's complicated
2013-01-18 07:03:26	R1cochet	can't you write a regex that only matches mva? m/^mva$/i
2013-01-18 07:03:41	R1cochet	granted thats a perl regex, but just match "mva" start to end
2013-01-18 07:03:54	torque	yes but that will only match it if it's the only word on the line
2013-01-18 07:04:20	torque	which I don't think is the desired result
2013-01-18 07:04:29	R1cochet	oh its matching in the string not the nick.
2013-01-18 07:04:37	R1cochet	?
2013-01-18 07:04:37	torque	yeah
2013-01-18 07:04:39	R1cochet	kk
2013-01-18 07:05:03	R1cochet	so what about .*\bmava\b.*
2013-01-18 07:05:24	R1cochet	correction .*\bmva\b.*
2013-01-18 07:05:43	R1cochet	so match anything that has the nick "mva" separated by a word boundry
2013-01-18 07:06:08	R1cochet	space comma EOL
2013-01-18 07:06:45	R1cochet	or can you not do /b modifier?
2013-01-18 07:07:47	torque	dunno if that works with weechat's regex engine. probably worth a shot tho
2013-01-18 07:09:40	R1cochet	what was option again? weechat.look.highlight

2013-01-18 07:10:58	torque	well that managed to freeze it
2013-01-18 07:11:04	R1cochet	ooh not good
2013-01-18 07:11:23	R1cochet	was option weechat.look.highlight?
2013-01-18 07:11:57	R1cochet	maybe try weechat.look.highlight_regex
2013-01-18 07:12:00	torque	weechat.look.highlight_regex = "\b" caused it to freeze
2013-01-18 07:12:02	torque	for me
2013-01-18 07:12:07	R1cochet	aww ok
2013-01-18 07:12:09	R1cochet	hmm
2013-01-18 07:12:41	R1cochet	what if match was " mva"
2013-01-18 07:12:51	R1cochet	but then that would catch " mvab"
2013-01-18 07:13:05	R1cochet	and not catch "mva "
2013-01-18 07:13:20	torque	anyway after that \b seems to work
2013-01-18 07:13:26	torque	so it may have been a coincidence
2013-01-18 07:13:34	R1cochet	aww ok
2013-01-18 07:13:35	R1cochet	cool
2013-01-18 07:13:47	R1cochet	so /bmva/b should work then

2013-01-18 07:14:28	torque	yeah so uh \b by itself is Bad News
2013-01-18 07:14:38	torque	but when it's part of an expression it's ok
2013-01-18 07:14:48	R1cochet	lol that will catch pretty much everything
2013-01-18 07:14:55	torque	yeah
2013-01-18 07:15:09	R1cochet	so "\b" bad "\bmva\b" good?
2013-01-18 07:15:31	torque	should be reasonable, yeah
2013-01-18 07:17:02	R1cochet	cool :)
2013-01-18 07:17:10	R1cochet	there you go mva. use that regex
2013-01-18 07:17:13	torque	fwiw, weechat.look.highlight_regex = "." does not cause crashing
2013-01-18 07:17:19	torque	and that does match literally everyting
2013-01-18 07:17:25	pmo	hey R1cochet did you see my highlight?
2013-01-18 07:17:33	R1cochet	pmo: no sorry
2013-01-18 07:17:38	torque	so uh, I guess it's not hanging because of slow matching
2013-01-18 07:17:41	R1cochet	can you repaste
2013-01-18 07:17:50	pmo	ah found an "bug" in yaurls

2013-01-18 07:27:18	R1cochet	shortening service.
2013-01-18 07:27:20	R1cochet	what are you using?
2013-01-18 07:27:23	pmo	ah might have been that
2013-01-18 07:27:26	pmo	default
2013-01-18 07:27:28	pmo	tinyurl
2013-01-18 07:27:32	R1cochet	ok
2013-01-18 07:27:32	torque	just built the latest git (df2867a) and it's still happening
2013-01-18 07:27:41	R1cochet	my guess is it was tinyurl error.
2013-01-18 07:27:55	pmo	yea, might have been down for 5 secs or something
2013-01-18 07:28:01	R1cochet	it would help if next time that happens, you also log the error printed in core buffer
2013-01-18 07:28:19	R1cochet	also, some services blacklist certain domains.
2013-01-18 07:28:21	pmo	im looking for it
2013-01-18 07:28:29	pmo	just takes a long time
2013-01-18 07:28:39	R1cochet	i use is.gd and it blocks some pornsite domains
2013-01-18 07:29:06	R1cochet	so i get an error instead of a shortened link. the error prints in core.
2013-01-18 07:29:28	pmo	nothing in core R1cochet
2013-01-18 07:29:37	R1cochet	hmm
2013-01-18 07:29:55	R1cochet	my best guess is that it was tinyurl then. its working now, and i cant duplicate
2013-01-18 07:29:56	pmo	the only other thing other than script load ups at start up
2013-01-18 07:30:01	pmo	fifo: pipe closed

2013-01-18 07:30:38	pmo	yes this is 2 days before the error :P

2013-01-18 07:31:00	pmo	i think thats when i shut my system down, forgetting to close weechat
2013-01-18 07:31:48	pmo	anyways im suspecting a 5 sec downtime from tinyurl
2013-01-18 07:31:52	R1cochet	pmo: if bug happens again, check core buffer for a few lines: "Error with command: some crap"
2013-01-18 07:31:56	pmo	or some chatset issues
2013-01-18 07:32:10	R1cochet	and: "ret code: (#)"
2013-01-18 07:32:12	pmo	there prob wount be any error
2013-01-18 07:32:20	pmo	so its most likely tinyurl
2013-01-18 07:32:49	pmo	maybe you mean if i have debug on?
2013-01-18 07:32:57	R1cochet	nope
2013-01-18 07:33:12	pmo	hmm then it will most likely post nothing to core
2013-01-18 07:33:24	R1cochet	script uses curl to get the shortened link. curl gives a return code after each call
2013-01-18 07:33:30	pmo	anyways we figured out its not a bug
2013-01-18 07:33:32	pmo	so all is good
2013-01-18 07:33:38	R1cochet	pmo: the script prints errors to core buffer
2013-01-18 07:33:55	pmo	strange how there is nothing in core when it failed then
2013-01-18 07:34:53	pmo	anyways tinyurl must just have been down between that url and till the next
2013-01-18 07:34:59	pmo	around those 5 secs
2013-01-18 07:35:09	pmo	shit happends :)

2013-01-18 07:36:56	R1cochet	yea ive had issues with is.gd
2013-01-18 07:37:08	pmo	for some reason just thought it could have been one :)
2013-01-18 07:37:19	R1cochet	all good.
2013-01-18 07:37:26	pmo	first dropbox url i noticed after i started using the script hehe
2013-01-18 07:37:29	R1cochet	if im not told about them then i dont know they exist :)
2013-01-18 07:37:39	R1cochet	thank you

2013-01-18 07:37:46	pmo	thank you ;)
2013-01-18 07:38:37	pmo	you know what could be cool R1cochet ?
2013-01-18 07:38:47	R1cochet	what?
2013-01-18 07:39:11	pmo	if the script allowed us to sign in to these url short services :p
2013-01-18 07:39:22	pmo	then we had a little urlgrabber :P
2013-01-18 07:39:45	R1cochet	i thought about that. it is possible
2013-01-18 07:39:53	pmo	just a fun idea :P
2013-01-18 07:39:53	R1cochet	but requires a lot of recoding.

2013-01-18 07:39:57	R1cochet	yes fun

2013-01-18 07:40:21	R1cochet	shouldnt be terrible. but i have a few other projects going atm
2013-01-18 07:40:46	pmo	but should that be made at a point, you should add so the script could grab like the 10 last ones etc :P
2013-01-18 07:41:03	pmo	yea this one has no importance :P
2013-01-18 07:41:09	pmo	just "fun"
2013-01-18 07:41:17	R1cochet	what do you mean grab the 10 last ones?
2013-01-18 07:41:34	pmo	the last 2 lines uploaded to the shorting services
2013-01-18 07:41:39	pmo	list them back to you :)
2013-01-18 07:41:49	pmo	err 10*
2013-01-18 07:42:22	pmo	like "/urllist 10" or something
2013-01-18 07:42:28	R1cochet	aww ok
2013-01-18 07:42:33	pmo	would post it to you :p

2013-01-18 07:44:05	pmo	if i get bored someday i can try :)
2013-01-18 07:44:11	pmo	since its curl hehe
2013-01-18 07:44:34	pmo	i already use curl for twitter hehe

2013-01-18 07:45:51	pmo	ah
2013-01-18 07:45:58	R1cochet	have it only print the shortened links?
2013-01-18 07:46:03	R1cochet	or original and shortened
2013-01-18 07:46:10	R1cochet	include speaking nick also?
2013-01-18 07:46:22	pmo	that could be done too :)
2013-01-18 07:46:26	R1cochet	yes it could
2013-01-18 07:46:32	R1cochet	im asking if it would be useful
2013-01-18 07:46:37	pmo	now we are going towards a full urlgrabber tho :P
2013-01-18 07:46:52	pmo	yaurlsgrab ;P
2013-01-18 07:47:12	R1cochet	well, the script listens for urls spoken and then shortens them. saving the shortened links in an array is easy
2013-01-18 07:47:15	pmo	but yes very useful

2013-01-18 07:59:29	@FlashCode	osse: yes: regex.h (POSIX regex functions)

2013-01-18 08:18:21	@FlashCode	jzhmer: you mean buffers bar?
2013-01-18 08:18:30	@FlashCode	you can set a size for this bar too (bar is called "buffers")
2013-01-18 08:18:47	@FlashCode	and you have options in buffers.* for max length
2013-01-18 08:18:58	osse	FlashCode: does <regex.h> support \b? If it's treated as a backspace then perhaps that could have some weird effects.

2013-01-18 11:26:14	diegoviola	i don't have experience with scripting weechat, but i've heard it supports many programming languages like lua, ruby, etc
2013-01-18 11:26:23	diegoviola	are most of the weechat api's exposed to those languages?
2013-01-18 11:26:25	diegoviola	how does it work?
2013-01-18 11:26:55	@FlashCode	diegoviola: yes, all supported languages (perl, python, ruby, lua, tcl, guile) have exactly same API
2013-01-18 11:27:07	@FlashCode	I suggest to read scripting guide for more info (and API reference)

2013-01-18 11:30:59	diegoviola	i was just curious about that
2013-01-18 11:31:07	nils_2	its always a good idea to check the script page first :-)

2013-01-18 11:31:36	diegoviola	it seems like weechat is designed to be more modular than irssi, i like that
2013-01-18 11:31:47	Nei	how is it more modular?
2013-01-18 11:32:03	diegoviola	well not sure if modular is the right word
2013-01-18 11:32:15	Nei	at least both weechat and irssi have "plugins" and "scripts"
2013-01-18 11:32:20	diegoviola	but i like the fact that irc is a module/plugin, that it supports many more languages
2013-01-18 11:32:21	diegoviola	etc
2013-01-18 11:33:06	Nei	well, check "/load" in irssi vs "/plugin" in weechat ;)

2013-01-18 11:33:43	@FlashCode	Nei: I think he meant in weechat irc is a plugin, and scripting API has a common skeleton for all languages
2013-01-18 11:33:44	wysiwtf	Nei: i think he means the fact that the irc-core itself is a plugin
2013-01-18 11:33:52	@FlashCode	which I think is not the case in irssi (stop me if I'm wrong :)
2013-01-18 11:34:02	wysiwtf	and with languages he probably means protocols ;D
2013-01-18 11:34:06	diegoviola	FlashCode: yes i mean that
2013-01-18 11:34:12	Nei	in irssi, irc is a plugin and the api is the same too
2013-01-18 11:34:28	Nei	irssi also has a jabber and a silc plugin
2013-01-18 11:34:34	@FlashCode	then I didn't know irc was a plugin
2013-01-18 11:34:57	diegoviola	in weechat you could write another irc plugin and unload the current one right? if you want to
2013-01-18 11:34:58	@FlashCode	so you can unload it?
2013-01-18 11:35:00	diegoviola	in theory
2013-01-18 11:35:28	diegoviola	could you write the irc plugins in different languages, etc?
2013-01-18 11:35:33	diegoviola	like in ruby
2013-01-18 11:35:48	@FlashCode	diegoviola: what do you mean by "irc plugins" ?

2013-01-18 11:36:10	diegoviola	FlashCode: irc protocol implementation
2013-01-18 11:36:18	diegoviola	FlashCode: the thing that allows me to connect to servers, etc
2013-01-18 11:36:22	@FlashCode	for example there is jabber.py
2013-01-18 11:36:26	Nei	well, in irssi you could unload it in theory but you are right that it doesn't actually work because it is compiled into core
2013-01-18 11:36:29	diegoviola	FlashCode: wow nice
2013-01-18 11:36:50	@FlashCode	Nei: then it's pseudo-plugin :)
2013-01-18 11:37:14	diegoviola	so the idea of weechat is to have a small core and many things as modular as possible?
2013-01-18 11:37:15	Nei	I agree :)
2013-01-18 11:37:18	diegoviola	and extensible with languages

2013-01-18 11:38:44	nils_2	bad thing of that, if you want only one functionality of a script (for example a ruby script), you'll have to load the ruby plugin.
2013-01-18 11:39:25	nils_2	but this is only a memory issue

2013-01-18 11:56:41	nils_2	the modularity(?) could be also a pain in the "brain". if you only use perl/python plugin (cause of memory issues) and you need a function a ruby script offers, you'll have to install ruby plugin. or you have to transform the ruby script to perl/python
2013-01-18 11:58:34	Nei	limiting scripters to 1 language has its advantage too
2013-01-18 11:59:09	R1cochet	i like the ability to blacklist plugins. i dont need no stinking logger/ruby/tcl/guile
2013-01-18 11:59:24	Nei	what if there is a guile script you really like
2013-01-18 11:59:29	R1cochet	hmm i could probably add rmodifier to bl also
2013-01-18 11:59:43	R1cochet	then i load guile ofc :)
2013-01-18 11:59:45	ectospasm	I rabidly log...
2013-01-18 11:59:59	@FlashCode	I prefer not showing my own blacklist, almost all plugins are in list :D
2013-01-18 12:00:12	R1cochet	as of yet ive only used py and pl
2013-01-18 12:00:56	Nei	it seems to me python is the weechat ideal
2013-01-18 12:01:02	R1cochet	ofc also im a perl nut and think all scripts in repo should have a perl version :)
2013-01-18 12:01:25	R1cochet	bah python has shit regex syntax
2013-01-18 12:01:44	R1cochet	and whats this 'import re' crap :)
2013-01-18 12:01:59	R1cochet	but really py is solid
2013-01-18 12:02:16	R1cochet	ii just dont know it well enough
2013-01-18 12:02:27	ectospasm	I just can't stand Python's white space requirement
2013-01-18 12:02:56	ectospasm	...but I may be coming around.  Haskell has one too and I can deal with it.
2013-01-18 12:03:56	@FlashCode	ectospasm: forcing people to indent is a great feature for me ;)
2013-01-18 12:04:43	Nei	I think it's a restriction of people's freedom
2013-01-18 12:04:43	ectospasm	I don't mind the indentation, but it shouldn't matter whether it's a tab (or three), or any number of spaces...
2013-01-18 12:06:41	R1cochet	whats a restriction?
2013-01-18 12:07:07	Nei	python is taking away my freedom to indent code the way I want
2013-01-18 12:07:17	R1cochet	aww
2013-01-18 12:07:20	R1cochet	yes
2013-01-18 12:07:53	xt	english grammar is restricting the way sentences I want to form make
2013-01-18 12:07:55	R1cochet	when i first started scripting perl i used 3 spaces ass indents
2013-01-18 12:08:07	xt	R1cochet: ass indents indeed!
2013-01-18 12:08:08	R1cochet	lol xt
2013-01-18 12:08:20	Nei	that's one reason to dislike english
2013-01-18 12:08:36	Nei	but I will use english if I have to (and python if I absolutely have to)
2013-01-18 12:09:01	R1cochet	python is good for gtk apps.
2013-01-18 12:09:14	R1cochet	any other reason to use py over perl?
2013-01-18 12:09:30	ectospasm	easier for the nub to read?
2013-01-18 12:09:46	Nei	perl is also good for gtk apps with the new gtk3 bindings
2013-01-18 12:09:49	R1cochet	well i dont worry about nubs
2013-01-18 12:10:10	ectospasm	I will say, Python is more attractive to read than Perl.
2013-01-18 12:10:13	R1cochet	Nei this is true. but more documentation for python
2013-01-18 12:10:21	ectospasm	I haven't coded much Python, and my Perl is rusty.
2013-01-18 12:10:27	ectospasm	real rusty.
2013-01-18 12:10:46	R1cochet	not that theres a lot of docs for gtk to begin with
2013-01-18 12:11:06	nils_2	every language has its pro and con. it depends on personal taste. the good thing on weechat, it supports many languages. in some case its bad (see above)
2013-01-18 12:11:11	ectospasm	typical of many projects, the code exists long before the documentation.
2013-01-18 12:11:19	R1cochet	and i dont understand c that well so reading what docs there are is rough for me
2013-01-18 12:11:38	ectospasm	the basics of C are easy
2013-01-18 12:11:52	ectospasm	...but most projects have developed their own framework
2013-01-18 12:12:03	R1cochet	thing is i want to do complicated stuff
2013-01-18 12:12:05	ectospasm	...and knowing the ins and outs of those is what's difficult

2013-01-18 20:07:39	v0n	hey there
2013-01-18 20:07:46	v0n	is there a web client for weechat yet?
2013-01-18 20:08:18	v0n	I'm trying subway : https://github.com/thedjpetersen/subway
2013-01-18 20:08:36	v0n	And the web integration is a smart idea, see the screenshot: https://a248.e.akamai.net/camo.github.com/2d29a9684ce0bd3a9f6de4e6d29b8c169261f08a/687474703a2f2f70656f706c652e6f7265676f6e73746174652e6564752f25374570657465727365642f636861742e706e67
2013-01-18 20:09:15	v0n	But the techno used are just perfect for a Hacker News article: "Assuming you already have node.js, npm, and mongo, run: [...]"
2013-01-18 20:09:51	v0n	I think weechat with a smart web interface would be awesome
2013-01-18 20:10:20	ubergeek42	v0n: there's a relay interface(not sure how complete), see: http://weecloud.jit.su/
2013-01-18 20:10:44	ubergeek42	and github for it: https://github.com/eirikb/weecloud

2013-01-18 20:11:38	v0n	as weechat has a strong backend (C, multiprotocol, etc), having feature such as embedded videos and image preview in the browser will be just perfect
2013-01-18 20:11:47	v0n	ubergeek42: I'll check this out
2013-01-18 20:13:08	v0n	ubergeek42: what's the relay?
2013-01-18 20:13:35	v0n	does that means that weechat is forwarding any messages?
2013-01-18 20:13:56	ubergeek42	basically.  weechat acts as a server for relay clients(using a custom protocol), and provides them with almost all of the information available

2013-01-18 20:19:11	v0n	the WCRP protocol ^^
2013-01-18 20:19:27	v0n	nice

2013-01-18 20:20:43	v0n	is weechat-nurses using the relay?
2013-01-18 20:20:53	ubergeek42	no, it just provides it
2013-01-18 20:21:37	v0n	will it use it later?
2013-01-18 20:21:42	-->	efkt (~efkt@gateway/tor-sasl/efkt) has joined #weechat
2013-01-18 20:22:42	ubergeek42	I don't see why it would; what benefit would there be?
2013-01-18 20:23:11	v0n	having the client/server architecture everywhere, no special case
2013-01-18 20:23:31	v0n	(I'm not saying it is the good way to go, just asking)
2013-01-18 20:23:53	ubergeek42	I doubt that's going to be the case, but it would be up to FlashCode to decide
2013-01-18 20:24:16	v0n	yup
2013-01-18 20:24:23	v0n	depends how we see things
2013-01-18 20:24:38	ubergeek42	I think there just isn't a big need for it
2013-01-18 20:24:51	v0n	either we say: weechat-ncurses is a client, so it should use the relay later,
2013-01-18 20:25:32	v0n	or we could say: weechat-ncurses is a client, but acts like a interface with weechat (the server side) in a first place

2013-01-18 23:33:02	bol1	Hi, i have a very specific problem: One nick in one channel gets a magenta color in the chat buffer, and there is no highlight or whatsoever defined in the config. I can't figure this out really.. Any ideas?
2013-01-18 23:34:20	torque	check weechat.color.chat_nick_colors
2013-01-18 23:34:28	torque	if you have magenta defined as one of the nick colors

2013-01-18 23:35:22	torque	then some nicks will be magenta
2013-01-18 23:35:58	bol1	torque: ah, there it was.. i haven't really figured out what that option does yet.
2013-01-18 23:36:01	bol1	thanks
2013-01-18 23:37:09	torque	that option is a list of which colors weechat uses to color nicks
2013-01-18 23:37:44	v0n	testing weecloud, works fine
2013-01-18 23:38:26	bol1	torque: ok, but how does weechat determine what nicks that should have the colors 01-09?
2013-01-18 23:38:33	torque	I believe the way the coloring algorithm works is by adding up the character codes of the letters in the nick, and taking the modulus of the length of the list
2013-01-18 23:38:44	torque	then using that color to color the nick
2013-01-18 23:39:07	bol1	ah, ok
2013-01-18 23:39:40	torque	simple but effective
2013-01-18 23:40:41	bol1	i can see the benefits from it in crowded channels, but it's not for me at the moment
2013-01-18 23:41:28	torque	you can disable colored nicks by simply setting the value to one color
2013-01-18 23:42:36	bol1	yeah, i'm on it :)

2013-01-19 13:44:57	nils_2	in your input line?
2013-01-19 13:45:05	Mahmoud	yeah
2013-01-19 13:45:43	Mahmoud	for    example this line has    excessive spaces   that i'd like to  automatically      cancel  without  doing it    manually
2013-01-19 13:45:49	nils_2	currently it does not exists a script who offer this. but its easy to code :-p
2013-01-19 13:46:27	Mahmoud	thought so... i know perl too. then it needs me to read about weechat's api. i'm too busy today. but will certainly be EXTREMELY FREE after 22nd of this month :)
2013-01-19 13:47:20	nils_2	so, you have an idea, a plan and free time ;-)
2013-01-19 13:48:18	pmo	isent there a "correct" list in weechat?
2013-01-19 13:48:30	nils_2	correct list?

2013-01-19 13:59:43	Mahmoud	xt: it currently has the fastest regexp among interpreted langs that i've benchmarked, and about the 1st fasted IO.. still among the few greatest ones for text parsing
2013-01-19 14:00:07	xt	yep, perl is alright for that. Noone is arguing your points. :)
2013-01-19 14:01:46	xt	if speed is the stuff you want, luajit is probably faster still
2013-01-19 14:02:03	Mahmoud	should i edit the sourcecode of text_replace.py to add my auto-corrections?
2013-01-19 14:02:21	xt	no, the settings can be set using /set
2013-01-19 14:02:34	Mahmoud	xt: interesting.. i  benchmarked lua's regexp and was slower. but didn't know about luajit.. certainly worth the try
2013-01-19 14:03:26	xt	luajit much much faster
2013-01-19 14:03:32	xt	give it a try and report back :)

2013-01-19 14:03:58	Mahmoud	much faster than what?
2013-01-19 14:04:14	MrElendig	if you really need speed for text parsing, just use pcre or similar

2013-01-19 14:07:28	xt	but python has batteries included, lua does not :)
2013-01-19 14:07:37	Mahmoud	batteries?
2013-01-19 14:07:58	xt	it's a common way of saying python has a much larger standard library and community

2013-01-20 14:26:44	pbos	atm. my current window only shows the #weechat buffer

2013-01-20 14:27:46	shad0VV	how is this possible with /layout?
2013-01-20 14:28:05	Deltafire	ah, you want it to work like it does in irssi ;)
2013-01-20 14:28:13	pmo	btw FlashCode, a compliment.. my sisters dog seems to love weechat.. ignore all other clients lol
2013-01-20 14:28:15	shad0VV	Deltafire: yes
2013-01-20 14:28:17	pmo	must be the colors
2013-01-20 14:28:33	Deltafire	i don't think you can stick buffers to windows like irssi does
2013-01-20 14:28:39	shad0VV	Deltafire: if it is possible
2013-01-20 14:28:41	Deltafire	tbh, it was a confusing feature
2013-01-20 14:29:11	shad0VV	i have set it up in irssi, but weechat has better features and it is easier to configure
2013-01-20 14:29:12	nils_2	and i don't see the advantage.
2013-01-20 14:29:36	shad0VV	nils_2: for me it was, as i can lock different server in different windows
2013-01-20 14:29:40	shad0VV	that's why
2013-01-20 14:30:08	Deltafire	maybe you could script some similar functionality
2013-01-20 14:30:16	nils_2	merge server buffers
2013-01-20 14:30:50	pbos	nils_2: I think he would for instance want all freenode channels in one buffer, all quakenets in another, etc.
2013-01-20 14:30:59	Deltafire	not buffer, window
2013-01-20 14:31:01	shad0VV	pbos: exactly
2013-01-20 14:31:03	pbos	eh, window
2013-01-20 14:31:07	pbos	I get those mixed up
2013-01-20 14:31:19	shad0VV	in window*
2013-01-20 14:32:03	shad0VV	it's not that necessary, i can live without this
2013-01-20 14:32:16	shad0VV	i thought that could be possible by default
2013-01-20 14:32:20	Deltafire	i used to use it when i was using irssi, and now i've almost forgotten it existed
2013-01-20 14:32:56	shad0VV	Deltafire: it's not that necessary but i have used to it, right now i can see more pros for weechat

2013-01-20 15:06:55	tmr	For you maybe, we don't know about shad0VV.
2013-01-20 15:08:52	Deltafire	it's not buffer merge - irssi has that also
2013-01-20 15:09:05	Deltafire	irssi has a feature where channels can be stuck to a window
2013-01-20 15:09:21	Deltafire	so you could have the weechat channel only display in the top split (for instance)
2013-01-20 15:09:38	Deltafire	in his case, he wanted all channels from one server to only display in one of the windows
2013-01-20 15:09:50	Deltafire	and the other server's channels to only display in the other window
2013-01-20 15:09:54	nils_2	and if you are on bottom window and you switch to #weechat?
2013-01-20 15:10:08	Deltafire	you'd be switched to the top window (if that's where you had stuck it)
2013-01-20 15:10:21	nils_2	ah ok.
2013-01-20 15:11:30	tmr	I didn't see a word about splits there, so didn't even think about that.

2013-01-21 01:46:24	xrdodrx	Is there a way to only auto-accept xfer chats from certain nicks?
2013-01-21 01:46:29	xrdodrx	I don't want to accept from everyone, that's insecure.

2013-01-21 14:16:29	monte_	not even a purge / re-compiling helps, always giving me those lines when trying to start weechat-curses
2013-01-21 14:16:31	monte_	http://screenshotuploader.com/s/01/aak4ty9xv
2013-01-21 14:17:10	Ratler	Interesting. I just diffed the two makefiles generated by old and new automake. There is one small difference. I'm guessing $(MKDIR_P) is undefined or something in the latter version
2013-01-21 14:17:11	Ratler	-mkdir_p = /usr/bin/mkdir -p
2013-01-21 14:17:11	Nei	Ratler: I think autogen has to run gettextize and then these errors have to be localized and fixed
2013-01-21 14:17:13	Ratler	+mkdir_p = $(MKDIR_P)
2013-01-21 14:17:48	Nei	because when there is a mismatch of versions you will end up with macros that got deprecated but are used by old version of toolchain
2013-01-21 14:18:05	Nei	automake is very convenient for end user if the distributor does the autogen
2013-01-21 14:18:28	Nei	how about if you run gettextize after autogen?

2013-01-21 14:19:41	Ratler	Then autoconf/automake get executed when I run configure and it fail even worse
2013-01-21 14:19:54	Nei	I see, that makes sense
2013-01-21 14:20:00	Ratler	But my guess is that MKDIR_P macro is the real cause
2013-01-21 14:20:10	Nei	autoconf detects that its config file has been tampered with and wants to reconfigure itself
2013-01-21 14:20:30	Nei	the "real cause" might well be the missing mkdir_p macro, but the real solution is not necessarily to reintroduce this macro
2013-01-21 14:20:48	Ratler	true
2013-01-21 14:20:55	Nei	you need an updated Makefile.in.in that matches your gettext/autotools

2013-01-21 14:21:51	Nei	is there any difference in the po/makefile.in.in that getttextize generates vs the builtin one?
2013-01-21 14:22:16	Ratler	I'll take a look
2013-01-21 14:24:01	Ratler	yea, there's a lot of difference between them

2013-01-21 14:25:55	monte_	:/ the last version i'm able to compile, is .3.9.1, all higher are giving out errors (.3.9.2 while compiling, .4.0 when trying to start the program)..
2013-01-21 14:26:21	Ratler	Nei: sure I'll give it a try
2013-01-21 14:26:23	Nei	monte_: maybe you didnt properly clear up all the weechat files
2013-01-21 14:26:51	Nei	FlashCode: I think you absolutely need to integrate gettextize with autogen otherwise such breakages will occur
2013-01-21 14:28:01	monte_	deleted both the .weechat and irc/ (containing all the bin/ lib/ etc things)
2013-01-21 14:28:18	monte_	tried to compile again but unsucessfully
2013-01-21 14:28:52	Nei	did you compile it in your local user account?

2013-01-21 14:29:14	Ratler	Nei: hmm this time it worked.... steps I took: generate the new Makefile.in.in, new fresh source, ./autogen.sh, copy Makefile.in.in to po/, ./configure; make; make install. 
2013-01-21 14:29:21	Nei	hehe
2013-01-21 14:29:48	monty	https://gist.github.com/4100684 - that gist was the only reason why i was even able to recompile that old version

2013-01-21 14:31:23	Nei	monty: the new weechat does not support configure anymore
2013-01-21 14:31:32	Nei	you need to install autotools (deprecated) or cmake
2013-01-21 14:31:46	Nei	maybe that's your problem
2013-01-21 14:32:02	Nei	if you don't have root on the server that is going to be an ugly task
2013-01-21 14:32:20	Ratler	Well at least you know how to reproduce the autoconf issue now, I will be switching our package over to use cmake instead, should have a long time ago. :P
2013-01-21 14:32:36	monty	will try to poke the serverowner then
2013-01-21 14:33:15	Nei	Ratler: I see serveral issues, the m4 dir is not declared properly in configure.ac, configure.ac does not exists (is still using the old deprecated configure.in)
2013-01-21 14:33:36	Nei	maybe that is related to the issues you are seeing
2013-01-21 14:34:04	Ratler	Yea could very well be
2013-01-21 14:35:33	Ratler	I would poke further at it if it wasn't that I can't think straight atm, darn fever :/
2013-01-21 14:36:49	Nei	Ratler: does it change anything if you add AC_CONFIG_MACRO_DIR([conf/m4]) to configure.in and fix Makefile.am to use ACLOCAL_AMFLAGS=-I conf/m4 ?
2013-01-21 14:37:24	Nei	not sure why FlashCode has configured it in this broken way
2013-01-21 14:37:49	Nei	oops
2013-01-21 14:37:56	Nei	that should read "config/m4" everywhere
2013-01-21 14:38:13	Scall	  /12
2013-01-21 14:38:25	@FlashCode	Nei: I have no idea either why FlashCode did this :D
2013-01-21 14:38:58	Nei	my guess:  you thought the m4 dir was ugly so you changed it in autogen.sh but didn't set it in makefile/configure
2013-01-21 14:39:07	Ratler	Nei: I'll test :)
2013-01-21 14:39:16	Nei	these are just silly guesses to fix the obvious
2013-01-21 14:39:30	Nei	maybe the actual problem requires a deeper fix
2013-01-21 14:39:46	Nei	I wonder why it doesn't find the i18n macro, but wrong m4 dirs might be 1 reason
2013-01-21 14:42:36	Ratler	Nei: fixing those macros fixed the issue actually

2013-01-21 14:43:04	Nei	so you now have a proper fix for the problem?
2013-01-21 14:43:17	Ratler	yup it seems so
2013-01-21 14:43:35	Nei	cool
2013-01-21 14:44:52	Nei	so the summary: add "run "gettextize -f --no-changelog"" to autogen.sh before the call to autopoint, fix macro dirs in configure.in and makefile.am, and it works?
2013-01-21 14:45:01	Nei	FlashCode: ^ you can commit the fix :D
2013-01-21 14:45:15	@FlashCode	if you have a patch, would be perfect :)

2013-01-21 14:46:27	Nei	oh ok
2013-01-21 14:46:28	Ratler	I can give you a patch
2013-01-21 14:46:46	Nei	well you have to make a patch that works for you, applied on a clean source
2013-01-21 14:47:10	Nei	and that doesnt involve any "copy makefile.in.in and restore previous state" hacks xD
2013-01-21 14:47:12	Ratler	I'll create a git-am patch for it once I'm done
2013-01-21 14:47:45	Nei	I still have the old gettext/automake here so it still works for me

2013-01-21 22:47:48	kaze`	sure thing, but if I lose connectivity and try to load a URL in Firefox, I get an error message -- whereas typing on an IRC chan with weechat won't raise any warning

2013-01-21 22:51:10	nils_2	does not make sense to send you the german text that will be displayed here :-)
2013-01-21 22:51:31	nils_2	first, upgrade your weechat.
2013-01-21 22:51:55	kaze`	I had this issue with weechat 0.3.4, too
2013-01-21 22:52:09	nils_2	second, check out /set irc.network.lag_disconnect

2013-01-21 22:53:10	nils_2	anyhow you are talking about a one year old version.
2013-01-21 22:55:46	kaze`	so
2013-01-21 22:55:54	kaze`	let's assume I upgrade now
2013-01-21 22:56:37	kaze`	if I open weechat, log on and start chatting on a chan, then disable my network from my OS
2013-01-21 22:57:05	kaze`	and then, keep on typing text in weechat
2013-01-21 22:57:20	kaze`	should it tell me that the connection is lost when I press [Enter]?
2013-01-21 22:59:06	stfn	if you disable the network your OS should close the socket properly and weechat should notice immediately that the connection was lost.
2013-01-21 22:59:48	stfn	problem is if the connection just "dies" quietly.
2013-01-21 23:00:01	stfn	then weechat cannot notice immediately, not even if you try to send messages.
2013-01-21 23:00:05	kaze`	.

2013-01-21 23:01:47	kaze`	I understand weechat can't be notified immediately, but I expect it to tell me that my connection is broken when I press [Enter]
2013-01-21 23:02:37	kaze`	(and FTR: here on Ubuntu 12.04 with gnome-network-manager, if I close my wifi connection I don't get any notification from weechat)
2013-01-21 23:04:44	kaze`	this works fine with /query messages, so I'd expect it to work with chans as well
2013-01-21 23:05:27	nesthib	stfn, troydm, kaze` I uploaded the package yesterday it's 0.4.0
2013-01-21 23:05:33	kaze`	well, not 'fine' -- but at least with /query messages I get a 'no such nick/channel' message when trying to send a message if I'm disconnected
2013-01-21 23:05:56	kaze`	nesthib: upgrading now, I'll confirm in a minute!
2013-01-21 23:06:07	troydm	nesthib: how is it 0.4.0 when my weechat says it's 0.3.9.2 ?
2013-01-21 23:06:20	nils_2	kaze`: weechat pings the server. if weechat does not get a response it will wait. see option i mentioned above
2013-01-21 23:06:58	troydm	nesthib: i've even tried reinstalling it
2013-01-21 23:07:00	kaze`	nils_2: this option = 0 here (default)

2013-01-21 23:07:54	nesthib	maybe I uploaded the commit just before 0.3.9

2013-01-21 23:29:20	R1cochet	because some people dont want to disconnect after 1min?

2013-01-21 23:36:35	kaze`	stfn: well, maybe I completely misunderstood this *lag setting. Thing is, I'm using IRC for my everyday job and I have to be warned that the text I'm sending does not reach the server.

2013-01-21 23:41:34	stfn	kaze`: how often the lag check happens is a different setting, irc.network.lag_check
2013-01-21 23:41:42	stfn	if you set it to 10 the lag check is performed every 10 seconds.

2013-01-21 23:42:30	stfn	and if your lag_disconnect option is set to 1 minute, it will take your weechat max 1 minute and 10 seconds to notice a lost connection.
2013-01-21 23:42:42	kaze`	stfn: sure thing, I just say the default settings for lag_check and lag_disconnect don't allow to be warned when the connection is lost, which is a pity

2013-01-21 23:45:11	kaze`	knowing 2 min later that it went off is ok

2013-01-21 23:45:35	kaze`	but when I send a message that the server doesn't get, I'd like to know it ASAP

2013-01-22 00:30:10	Nei	FiXato: in 2010 you complained about the key bindings list, wanna test my nicekey script
2013-01-22 00:31:04	FiXato	pbos, you could also evaluate ${window.number}
2013-01-22 00:31:18	FiXato	Nei, wow, that's a long time ago :P
2013-01-22 00:31:23	FiXato	but sure :)
2013-01-22 00:31:52	FiXato	though I guess I've gotten used to the common keybindings and know now how to set my own :P
2013-01-22 00:32:19	FiXato	pbos, I have per-window input bar
2013-01-22 00:32:30	FiXato	and I have tried a root input bar too, but didn't like it
2013-01-22 00:32:39	pbos	FiXato: can I have a screenshot of your current setup? :)
2013-01-22 00:33:07	Nei	FiXato: http://anti.teamidiot.de/static/nei/*/Code/WeeChat/alpha/nicekey.pl
2013-01-22 00:33:15	FiXato	I only showmy input bar on the active window though, so I have gotten used to using the position of the input bar as an indicator of which window is active
2013-01-22 00:33:51	FiXato	imho it is easier and more logical to look at the bottom of the active window for typing text, than at the bottom of the screen (or top) for a root input buffer
2013-01-22 00:33:58	FiXato	lemme give it a go Nei :)

2013-01-22 00:36:00	FiXato	indeed; my problem exacty
2013-01-22 00:36:22	FiXato	I like the idea of a single input bar, but in practise it screwed up my mind
2013-01-22 00:36:25	pbos	FiXato: I can't see the input window though?

2013-01-22 00:36:58	FiXato	that's the only one I have
2013-01-22 00:37:08	FiXato	I have set the condition to active_window
2013-01-22 00:37:19	pbos	ah
2013-01-22 00:37:23	pbos	fair enough :)
2013-01-22 00:37:52	FiXato	because having it in inactive windows is a waste of space, and possibly a way to screw up typing in the wrong window :P
2013-01-22 00:38:13	pbos	yeah, that's the default though
2013-01-22 00:38:16	pbos	hence the question

2013-01-22 00:38:30	FiXato	Nei, wat is [|unknown|] and [rxvt std] for some keys?
2013-01-22 00:38:32	pbos	(might also be hard to spot which one's your currently selected one
2013-01-22 00:38:38	pbos	especially when gnome-terminal is broken
2013-01-22 00:38:55	Nei	FiXato: that is annotation shows you which key definition the key comes from
2013-01-22 00:39:04	Nei	rxvt = comes from rxvt, std = comes from the vtxxx standard
2013-01-22 00:39:23	Nei	unknown = I don't know this key, if you know which terminal emulator makes it I will add it :D
2013-01-22 00:39:40	FiXato	eh, no idea :P
2013-01-22 00:39:48	FiXato	xterm I guess

2013-01-22 00:40:42	Nei	do you have seperate alt+meta keys :>?

2013-01-22 00:41:16	Nei	I will add these definitions to the script
2013-01-22 00:41:42	Nei	yes I know it is standard encoding for meta key but not alt key
2013-01-22 00:41:58	Nei	I really don't knpow about the meta-O F
2013-01-22 00:42:18	Nei	I don't think you get meta-OF when you do alt_k "End" or do you
2013-01-22 00:42:29	FiXato	nope
2013-01-22 00:42:31	Nei	;)
2013-01-22 00:42:33	FiXato	might be something from my mac
2013-01-22 00:42:40	Nei	it's a default binding in weechat
2013-01-22 00:42:41	FiXato	which I am not on atm
2013-01-22 00:42:43	FiXato	ah
2013-01-22 00:42:54	Nei	but I don't know where it comes from
2013-01-22 00:42:59	FiXato	and the meta2-1?
2013-01-22 00:43:09	Nei	while I can guess that it is supposed to be end key, I dont want to write it down without reference 
2013-01-22 00:43:18	Nei	meta2-1;9B is indeed xterm
2013-01-22 00:43:42	Nei	tha'ts the meta(not alt)-down key
2013-01-22 00:43:58	Nei	I will probably choose to display it just as M- too

2013-01-22 00:44:47	Nei	if you have them both you can have ;9 = meta(not alt), and ;3 = alt or meta
2013-01-22 00:45:07	Nei	normal people only have ;3 so I only coded that into the script
2013-01-22 00:46:04	FiXato	I'll have to test some things on a terminal emulator that doesn't steal half my modifier keys

2013-01-22 00:47:52	FiXato	why prefix everything with [key] though?
2013-01-22 00:47:58	FiXato	even the mouse gestures?
2013-01-22 00:49:27	Nei	I have prefixed all the output from the script with [key]
2013-01-22 00:49:39	Nei	otherweise the prefix is empty ^^
2013-01-22 00:49:45	FiXato	ah, ok :)
2013-01-22 00:49:54	Nei	also try /nicekey whereis * delete_previous_word and /nicekey showseq M-w
2013-01-22 00:50:10	FiXato	I would've perhaps used the context as a prefix )
2013-01-22 00:50:55	FiXato	'which are shadowed'? sounds rather technical :)
2013-01-22 00:51:19	Nei	 I will change it to  "which start with this key"
2013-01-22 00:51:22	FiXato	perhaps something like 'which contain $keysequence?
2013-01-22 00:51:26	FiXato	or that :)
2013-01-22 00:51:31	FiXato	but nice :D
2013-01-22 00:54:26	FiXato	what is the difference between showseq and showseq2?

2013-01-22 00:57:13	FiXato	I like /nicekey list btw
2013-01-22 00:57:13	Nei	(as far as known to my script)
2013-01-22 00:57:48	FiXato	(also, why is it shown as 'list*' in the /help text? to indicate you can pass the list arguments to it?
2013-01-22 00:57:54	Nei	you like it better than the "/nicekey" list?
2013-01-22 00:58:37	Nei	you can use list, listdiff, and listdefault, each with a specific context (default, cursor, search)
2013-01-22 00:58:45	FiXato	yes, I do, because it has colours :D

2013-01-23 02:59:41	jenic	sorry :( I'm assuming it has something to do with how it was compiled? Do other homebrew users have python?
2013-01-23 03:00:34	replicant	to be honest, i'm not quite sure.. i'd assume its common as a lot of libs and various other apps rely on it for scripting/plugins

2013-01-23 05:13:47	torque	what version of weechat do you have?
2013-01-23 05:14:37	bakis	how do i check?
2013-01-23 05:14:53	torque	go to the weechat buffer and type /version
2013-01-23 05:14:57	gb	if it's the version you are using you will need to install weeget or upgrade to a latewr version
2013-01-23 05:16:28	gb	even if you install weeget you will still need to add an alias for /script to weeget for it to work the same way
2013-01-23 05:16:50	gb	probably easier to just install a recent version off the website
2013-01-23 05:17:44	torque	anyway, if you have a version before 0.3.9 you should upgrade
2013-01-23 05:17:46	gb	just depends on what you want to do and why you come to be using such an old version

2013-01-23 05:18:07	torque	not in the irc buffer
2013-01-23 05:18:10	torque	in the weechat buffer
2013-01-23 05:18:28	bakis	wat
2013-01-23 05:18:36	gb	your version is bakis: WeeChat 0.3.2 (Jun 18 2010)

2013-01-23 05:18:47	torque	that's severely outdated
2013-01-23 05:19:01	bakis	i'm on a server so i don't have permission to update, but i'll ask them to
2013-01-23 05:19:24	torque	that would be good
2013-01-23 05:19:33	gb	bakis: they might not be able too depending on what is running
2013-01-23 05:19:47	gb	old versions of debian do not have the needed libraries
2013-01-23 05:19:53	bakis	hmm
2013-01-23 05:20:06	bakis	maybe i'll have to idle somewhere else then

2013-01-23 05:47:44	gb	my router drops out when it gets too hot requiring me to powercycle and lower/raise the ethernet once a connection is reestablished
2013-01-23 05:48:33	gb	so i'd rather weechat reconnect when the ethernet connection comes backup
2013-01-23 05:49:12	gb	instead of waiting however long or doing a /reconnect in weechat
2013-01-23 05:55:19	mumixam	sounds like you should get new hardware
2013-01-23 05:57:43	gb	nah the router works fine usually but i also live on the fringe of society

2013-01-23 12:54:26	R1cochet	about /upgrade
2013-01-23 12:55:14	R1cochet	when i upgraded, i later took a look at processes and noticed that there was weechat-curses and weechat-curses /upgrade running. this was a while after i had issued the /upgrade command and all had gone fine
2013-01-23 12:56:53	@FlashCode	R1cochet: the second process is probably for reconnecting to SSL servers (if you are using SSL)
2013-01-23 12:57:03	@FlashCode	and then it's run after the upgrade process
2013-01-23 12:57:31	@FlashCode	during the upgrade, weechat does not fork, so you should see only one process

2013-01-23 13:03:39	R1cochet	FlashCode i had noticed this over an hour after upgrade and after ssl connections reestablished
2013-01-23 13:04:17	R1cochet	pretty sure it was over an hr after. was definitely after reconnections
2013-01-23 13:04:29	@FlashCode	so how can it be /upgrade ? ;)
2013-01-23 13:04:47	@FlashCode	maybe a script doing some action, like hook_process (for example to download an URL)
2013-01-23 13:05:20	R1cochet	not sure but process manager said weechat-curses upgrade in separate process
2013-01-23 13:05:36	R1cochet	hmm could be script
2013-01-23 13:06:28	R1cochet	but did say upgrade in process name. ill see if i can reproduce in the morning. 4am right now

2013-01-23 23:20:16	swimmer	?
2013-01-23 23:20:28	frew	well I was looking at the html docs for server
2013-01-23 23:20:31	frew	will that have more?
2013-01-23 23:20:41	frew	no it's the same.

2013-01-23 23:20:58	swimmer	oh ninja'd ;-)
2013-01-23 23:21:30	frew	ah I guess I should look at options :p
2013-01-23 23:21:43	frew	maybe I'll just edit the config file by hand
2013-01-23 23:23:36	R1cochet	NO DONT!!!
2013-01-23 23:23:49	R1cochet	that can screw up the config file
2013-01-23 23:23:57	R1cochet	DO NOT EDIT CONFIG FILE OUTSIDE OF WEECHAT
2013-01-23 23:24:10	frew	ugh

2013-01-23 23:24:17	 *	frew has flashbacks of irssi
2013-01-23 23:24:24	R1cochet	frew: to add options on command line just prepend the option name with a "-"
2013-01-23 23:25:35	R1cochet	so for command /server add name address/port -command /msg nickserv identify <password> -ssl on -ssl_dhkey_size 1024 ...
2013-01-23 23:25:37	R1cochet	like that
2013-01-23 23:25:39	R1cochet	should work
2013-01-23 23:25:40	frew	R1cochet: yes, I thought it was clear that I knew that from my example above ;)
2013-01-23 23:25:53	frew	:17:19:45:. < frew> where can I get a list of options that are available for /server add (as in -options, like -ssl)
2013-01-23 23:26:03	R1cochet	aww ok
2013-01-23 23:26:08	frew	thanks anyway
2013-01-23 23:26:12	R1cochet	then not sure what you are asking?
2013-01-23 23:26:22	frew	R1cochet: did you see the question?  
2013-01-23 23:26:25	R1cochet	to see what the possible options are /set irc.server.*
2013-01-23 23:26:28	frew	right
2013-01-23 23:26:35	frew	I got that far too :)
2013-01-23 23:26:47	frew	I'm not used to this options format
2013-01-23 23:27:45	R1cochet	you can add a server then change the options
2013-01-23 23:27:51	R1cochet	thats what i usually do
2013-01-23 23:28:00	frew	right
2013-01-23 23:28:02	frew	that's what I'm doing
2013-01-23 23:28:06	frew	actually I added one server
2013-01-23 23:28:07	R1cochet	instead of all that option on command line stuff :)
2013-01-23 23:28:10	frew	and then copy pasted it four times
2013-01-23 23:28:13	swimmer	frew: did you have a look at iset.pl already?
2013-01-23 23:28:23	frew	since I have a ZNC bouncer that just changes the password per acct
2013-01-23 23:28:25	R1cochet	nice though if you want to connect to a temp server
2013-01-23 23:28:27	frew	swimmer: not at all

2013-01-23 23:28:48	R1cochet	frew: is quite nice
2013-01-23 23:28:49	swimmer	perhaps that's more what you want to get an overview of the options you want to edit
2013-01-23 23:28:50	frew	I almost never connect to temp servers
2013-01-23 23:28:51	R1cochet	opens a new buffer
2013-01-23 23:28:57	R1cochet	frew: me neither :)
2013-01-23 23:29:02	R1cochet	always add them
2013-01-23 23:29:04	frew	right
2013-01-23 23:29:20	frew	swimmer: I'll take a look
2013-01-23 23:29:30	R1cochet	frew: you may want buffers.pl also :)
2013-01-23 23:29:31	swimmer	good :)
2013-01-23 23:29:32	R1cochet	nice script
2013-01-23 23:29:36	swimmer	jejeje
2013-01-23 23:29:38	R1cochet	along with a url shortening script
2013-01-23 23:29:42	frew	my plan is to get all of my servers set up, all of my aliases working, and then get it to be mostly themed like my irssi
2013-01-23 23:29:48	swimmer	I know what that one is ... ;-)
2013-01-23 23:30:04	R1cochet	frew: this is possible and then some
2013-01-23 23:30:18	R1cochet	i prefer separate input bar for each window though myself
2013-01-23 23:30:18	frew	is there a way to make the autocompletion... better?
2013-01-23 23:30:31	R1cochet	frew: which autocomplete?
2013-01-23 23:30:36	R1cochet	the settings or nick
2013-01-23 23:30:36	frew	nick
2013-01-23 23:30:43	R1cochet	better how?
2013-01-23 23:30:48	frew	I'd like it to sort by who I highlighted last
2013-01-23 23:30:51	frew	(irssi does this)
2013-01-23 23:30:59	R1cochet	aww there may be a script
2013-01-23 23:31:00	frew	instead of dumb alphabetical
2013-01-23 23:31:02	R1cochet	or one in the making
2013-01-23 23:31:08	R1cochet	dont remember
2013-01-23 23:31:17	R1cochet	frew: also /script command :)

2013-01-23 23:31:59	R1cochet	it will add autostart symlink for you
2013-01-23 23:32:02	frew	oh neat
2013-01-23 23:32:24	frew	swimmer: it's a little different, but *might* be good enough
2013-01-23 23:32:42	swimmer	he it's a beginning ;-)
2013-01-23 23:32:50	frew	oh speakers_hightlights looks exactly like what I said I think

2013-01-23 23:34:00	swimmer	not sure what I was after

2013-01-23 23:37:58	frew	hmm
2013-01-23 23:38:16	frew	I think it's autocompleting people who hightlighted ME last
2013-01-23 23:38:21	frew	instead of who *I* hightlighted last
2013-01-23 23:38:24	R1cochet	option "irc.look.nick_completion_smart" possible values: "off", "speakers", "speakers_highlights"
2013-01-23 23:38:28	frew	right
2013-01-23 23:38:37	R1cochet	yea not sure how it works
2013-01-23 23:38:51	R1cochet	i think there is a script for this. i know someone was talking about this not to long ago

2013-01-23 23:39:02	frew	R1cochet: if you find it ping me
2013-01-23 23:39:06	R1cochet	didnt pay much attention because i dont mind how it works
2013-01-23 23:39:07	frew	I'll look for it later

2013-01-23 23:39:24	R1cochet	is that what you mean?
2013-01-23 23:39:59	frew	just hightlight me is what I mean :)

2013-01-24 09:35:54	@FlashCode	I don't know, never looked at code (and I use android, but I'm don't know android dev)
2013-01-24 09:36:07	BullShark	FlashCode -> as a java program for android, the code is so similar that it would be very easy to port it to pc where any platform a jvm can be ran
2013-01-24 09:36:45	@FlashCode	but I suppose it is using android toolkits/widgets for display, no? in that case it's not easy to port that to other platform
2013-01-24 09:37:54	BullShark	FlashCode -> java is strongly related to C. you won't want to write python scripts anymore if you become familiar.
2013-01-24 09:38:00	Nei	it would be difficult because the android runtime environment isnt running on your pc
2013-01-24 09:38:21	Nei	except python script = 5 lines, java script = 5 classes with 20 lines

2013-01-24 09:39:16	Nei	no, changes would be major
2013-01-24 09:39:27	Nei	because none of the libraries are there for the pc
2013-01-24 09:39:37	Nei	and that's all the code really does, combine the android libs

2013-01-24 09:46:10	Nei	surely java is no match for c++

2013-01-24 09:46:46	Votan	BullShark  no, just stated the obvious without the need to start a war. coding discussion are like discussions about distributions

2013-01-24 09:51:30	Nei	up to 10x slower at that
2013-01-24 09:51:32	Nei	than c++

2013-01-24 11:02:00	@FlashCode	at least for default freenode server
2013-01-24 11:02:10	@FlashCode	for the servers you add, you can of course use it by default
2013-01-24 11:02:46	@FlashCode	what do you mean by safely (except for SSL) ?
2013-01-24 11:03:16	ymf	FlashCode: I have no idea... > < maybe hide my ip and such?
2013-01-24 11:04:00	@FlashCode	ymf: this is not stuff your client can do (itself I mean), you would have to use external things, like tor, or settings on servers maybe
2013-01-24 11:04:15	ymf	FlashCode: without SSL, can sniffer tools extract messages easily?
2013-01-24 11:04:30	@FlashCode	yes, IRC protocol is plain-text
2013-01-24 11:05:03	ymf	FlashCode: so it's the nature that IRC protocol may expose your ip?
2013-01-24 11:05:08	@FlashCode	but btw SSL will only encrypt data between you and the server
2013-01-24 11:05:37	@FlashCode	so if you're talking with someone not using SSL, your message will not be encrypted between server and this nick

2013-01-24 11:09:26	BullShark	problem with otr is that it's only encrypted between 2 participants, not more than that

2013-01-24 11:10:50	Votan	ymf  znc is an irc bouncer, u'd have to setup the service and connect to it, it is not a plugin or addon for an irc client

2013-01-24 11:12:24	BullShark	ymf -> if the convo is only between you and one other individual, otr is fine
2013-01-24 11:12:25	ymf	Votan: so it's like a proxy server, right?
2013-01-24 11:13:35	Votan	ymf well, you could see it like a proxy that stays connected to the irc for you, yes
2013-01-24 11:14:01	BullShark	the server has all the ssl certificates right?
2013-01-24 11:14:12	Votan	and on this server, you can either connect to as many irc networks as you want, and/or can use it to chat with other people connected to it on a secured way
2013-01-24 11:14:31	BullShark	that means somebody who has access to the server and ssl certificates can decrypt all
2013-01-24 11:14:47	BullShark	otr keys do not exist on the server
2013-01-24 11:17:08	ymf	BullShark: a good tool, but i prefer a lightweight solution that's easy to start with.
2013-01-24 11:19:55	bps	ymf: you can ask in #freenode for a generic cloak also. "/whois candide" for an example

2013-01-24 11:33:04	grawity	ymf: so that doesn't mean that SSL or OTR aren't secure enough

2013-01-24 11:34:17	grawity	ymf: so you *should* use SSL anyway, to protect such things as your NickServ login info

2013-01-24 11:38:19	ymf	BullShark: wait a minute, 'otr' means 'off the record' literally. does that have anything to do with transmition security?
2013-01-24 11:39:04	ymf	BullShark: i mean 'off the record' sounds like it just turns off the logger.

2013-01-24 21:36:27	v0n	FlashCode: read what I said just after my message to you: "FlashCode: I have a wonderful plugin idea"
2013-01-24 21:37:37	@FlashCode	I have read
2013-01-24 21:37:46	@FlashCode	but what's the difference with weecloud ? :p
2013-01-24 21:38:29	@FlashCode	weechat protocol is binary because there are large data sent
2013-01-24 21:38:37	@FlashCode	so it can be compressed using gzip
2013-01-24 21:38:46	@FlashCode	that's why you don't have json or other text format
2013-01-24 21:38:54	v0n	weechat > relay > tcp socket > node weechat module > web api > webinterface
2013-01-24 21:38:57	v0n	the idea is:
2013-01-24 21:39:04	v0n	weechat > websocket plugin > webinterface
2013-01-24 21:39:34	adaptr	glad to see that weechat still > *, at least
2013-01-24 21:39:43	@FlashCode	sorry, but I don't understand the difference with weecloud :p

2013-01-24 21:41:21	blackspark	Just going to say that the in-place /upgrade feature is by far my favorite :)
2013-01-24 21:43:33	nils_2	then install cron.py and /upgrade periodically :-D
2013-01-24 21:44:53	v0n	FlashCode: the interest of having a websocket plugin, is that you merge node + weechat_node_module + json into a single weechat module
2013-01-24 21:45:48	v0n	it's like* you merge 
2013-01-24 21:46:10	@FlashCode	so it's same feature, but written in a different way
2013-01-24 21:46:25	v0n	simplified
2013-01-24 21:46:37	v0n	no many layer for a web interface
2013-01-24 21:47:02	v0n	you just need weechat + websocket_plugin + weechat.html
2013-01-24 21:47:06	v0n	nothing else
2013-01-24 21:47:53	v0n	by weechat.html I meant a single html page. No server, library or whatever

2013-01-24 22:49:53	KokaKiwi	Hum, I've a question, i'm writing a plugin to add Javascript as script language for Weechat, but for this, i'm using Google's v8 engine, and it's written in C++. But the Weechat doc specify that Weechat plugins are written in C. So I'm wondering if my plugin (written in C++, but can be linked as a shared library) is a problem. :/

2013-01-25 12:22:42	KokaKiwi	Well, I'm writing a plugin to add Javascript as script language for Weechat, but for this, i'm using Google's v8 engine, and it's written in C++. But the Weechat doc specify that Weechat plugins are written in C. So I'm wondering if my plugin (written in C++, but can be linked as a shared library) is a problem. :/
2013-01-25 12:23:16	Nei	cool, looking forward to javascript support
2013-01-25 12:23:40	Nei	v8 doesn't have a C api by chance
2013-01-25 12:23:42	Nei	?
2013-01-25 12:24:08	@FlashCode	it would be better in C for plugins
2013-01-25 12:24:58	@FlashCode	or maybe you could use other JS engine, which has a C API ?
2013-01-25 12:25:18	@FlashCode	the speed/optimization is probably less important in weechat than in a browser (if that's why you chose this engine)
2013-01-25 12:27:29	KokaKiwi	Nei: Nope, no C linking for v8 :/
2013-01-25 12:28:18	@FlashCode	KokaKiwi: btw, is this lib officially available in most distros? like debian for example
2013-01-25 12:28:45	@FlashCode	if not, you have zero chance to be included in official weechat git repo (C++ is a serious handicap too, even if such plugin can be loaded)
2013-01-25 12:29:00	KokaKiwi	FlashCode: Yep, on Debian/Ubuntu, v8 is available in apt repositories
2013-01-25 12:29:21	KokaKiwi	(I think, I must re-verify, but I think it is)

2013-01-25 14:28:07	spiralofhope	I see it, thanks

2013-01-25 14:38:49	Nei	check weechat::current_buffer function
2013-01-25 14:39:57	excalibr	thanks
2013-01-25 14:41:11	Pantsu	also you will usually get the current buffer as a pointer in callbacks

2013-01-25 14:45:15	Nei	true
2013-01-25 14:45:19	@FlashCode	because the current buffer is not always the buffer where a callback is executed

2013-01-25 14:46:34	Nei	git grep -l current_buffer inside weechat-scripts xDDD
2013-01-25 14:46:45	Nei	only 73 scripts use it

2013-01-25 14:48:47	@FlashCode	it is ~30% of scripts
2013-01-25 14:48:59	Nei	;) probably it's not always used incorrectly
2013-01-25 14:49:22	@FlashCode	sure, I have to check
2013-01-25 14:49:43	@FlashCode	low urgency though, the problem is not blocking :)

2013-01-25 14:59:25	KokaKiwi	I don't know, I must test it :/
2013-01-25 14:59:25	Nei	you also need to have some sensible npi otherwise noone will use the javascript scripting

2013-01-26 00:52:03	R1cochet	you dont like the alternate toc?
2013-01-26 00:52:03	pbos	frame stuff has never been a good idea :/
2013-01-26 00:52:07	pbos	nope
2013-01-26 00:52:16	R1cochet	but it makes it easier to jump around
2013-01-26 00:52:24	R1cochet	i dont mind either way
2013-01-26 00:52:35	R1cochet	they both have advantages/disadvantages
2013-01-26 00:52:38	pbos	I think the headers should link back up to their toc equivalents
2013-01-26 00:52:44	pbos	that'd give the same advantage
2013-01-26 00:52:50	pbos	but without the ugly thing
2013-01-26 00:52:59	R1cochet	pbos: the toc is generated w/ javascript though
2013-01-26 00:53:08	pbos	huh?
2013-01-26 00:53:23	R1cochet	the TOC is not hardcoded in the html

2013-01-26 00:53:32	R1cochet	it is generated w/ javascript
2013-01-26 00:53:41	pbos	.. why?
2013-01-26 00:53:50	R1cochet	because the docs are written in asciidoc
2013-01-26 00:53:54	pbos	why's there javascript in this page?
2013-01-26 00:54:09	pbos	I thought they were textile/markdown?
2013-01-26 00:54:10	R1cochet	and then converted w/ asciidoc to html/pdf/ebook/epub/...
2013-01-26 00:54:18	R1cochet	that way it only needs to be written once
2013-01-26 00:54:32	R1cochet	written in asciidoc
2013-01-26 00:55:00	pbos	yeah, sounds good
2013-01-26 00:55:16	pbos	generator/javascript should be able to get two-way linkage though?
2013-01-26 00:55:32	pbos	at least if it's a custom thing
2013-01-26 00:55:41	tigrmesh	nils_2: PING
2013-01-26 00:55:44	AzziWeaver	generator should create hard toc
2013-01-26 00:55:48	tigrmesh	sorry
2013-01-26 00:55:59	pbos	yes it should
2013-01-26 00:56:02	nils_2	pong
2013-01-26 00:56:06	AzziWeaver	realtime toc generation clienttside is asinine
2013-01-26 00:56:21	R1cochet	i guess it would be possible to do a two way linkage but that requires having to create your own asciidoc style
2013-01-26 00:56:29	R1cochet	which looks like a pita imo
2013-01-26 00:56:31	pbos	depends on whether the generator is custom though
2013-01-26 00:56:42	pbos	R1cochet: know if the toc generator is custom?
2013-01-26 00:56:51	R1cochet	it has a style iirc
2013-01-26 00:56:56	R1cochet	check their website. lol
2013-01-26 00:57:05	R1cochet	some things are documented well
2013-01-26 00:57:08	R1cochet	others not so much
2013-01-26 00:57:24	R1cochet	and gl finding examples in google. i wasnt able to
2013-01-26 00:57:40	pbos	I'm thinking that if the toc is generated from a custom script, then on a header, encapsulate it in a <a href="#that_tag_toc">
2013-01-26 00:57:59	pbos	either way, I'm not sure this is where time is best spent either way
2013-01-26 00:58:35	pbos	a scrolling side bar looks ugly imo, I've never liked them
2013-01-26 00:58:43	R1cochet	pbos: if you view source of any of the html docs, you will see the script in the <head> field

2013-01-26 00:59:40	R1cochet	well you can tell asciidoc to use a different javascript
2013-01-26 00:59:42	nils_2	tigrmesh: pong
2013-01-26 00:59:47	tigrmesh	nils_2:  weather.py uses google's weather api.  but google has killed it.  do you know if FlashCode removes scripts that are permanently broken?
2013-01-26 00:59:48	R1cochet	but again, looks like a pita to do
2013-01-26 00:59:50	R1cochet	from what i read
2013-01-26 01:00:16	pbos	R1cochet: yeah, as I said, doubt this is where time is best spent
2013-01-26 01:00:29	R1cochet	i was looking at changing the appearance of a doc im working on for html. but tbh it seems easier to just have asciidoc do its thing, then modify the html manually
2013-01-26 01:00:49	pbos	define manually
2013-01-26 01:01:03	R1cochet	open it in an editor and change the css crap
2013-01-26 01:01:16	R1cochet	after asciidoc has generated the html for me
2013-01-26 01:01:17	pbos	that sounds like a worse pita though imo?
2013-01-26 01:01:28	pbos	(I hate manual labor)

2013-01-26 01:01:42	R1cochet	so should be easier than having to create my own asciidoc template
2013-01-26 01:01:53	pbos	I'd make a script for doing your changes

2013-01-26 01:01:55	R1cochet	i dont plan on doing it until doc is done
2013-01-26 01:02:00	pbos	maybe something ruby with nokogiri
2013-01-26 01:02:02	nils_2	i think script should be moved to unofficial scripts
2013-01-26 01:02:06	R1cochet	and then i will just keep a copy around to cut/paste :)

2013-01-26 01:02:20	R1cochet	nils_2: what script?
2013-01-26 01:02:31	nils_2	maybe another weather api exists and script can be adopted
2013-01-26 01:02:47	R1cochet	oh weather script :(

2013-01-26 01:03:27	nils_2	the old script.pl is useful for people who don't want to upgrade

2013-01-26 01:30:08	R1cochet	ritz but a bit pricey. i ordered my canon online from reputable seller.
2013-01-26 01:30:20	R1cochet	do NOT buy anything online of the store is located in NY
2013-01-26 01:30:27	R1cochet	read reviews.
2013-01-26 01:30:31	pbos	what's a reputable seller in your mind?
2013-01-26 01:30:39	R1cochet	not in NY
2013-01-26 01:30:40	pbos	I'll compare prices to local ones
2013-01-26 01:30:41	R1cochet	:)
2013-01-26 01:30:44	pbos	in SF
2013-01-26 01:30:48	R1cochet	local places are going to be expensive
2013-01-26 01:30:51	pbos	(linky?)
2013-01-26 01:30:54	R1cochet	and shit in SF is all expensive
2013-01-26 01:31:26	R1cochet	also, u buy it in america, when u get home ur warranty is no good
2013-01-26 01:31:47	R1cochet	plus that plug adapter issue
2013-01-26 01:32:04	R1cochet	i dont know of camera stores in SF
2013-01-26 01:32:33	nils_2	R1cochet: I met a guy in a pub and he bring me aboard the ship. it was so huge, unbelievable. never was so close to fighter aircraft's 
2013-01-26 01:32:37	R1cochet	there should be deals where u can get the camera body and a good lens in a package
2013-01-26 01:32:38	pbos	I'll be staying for two weeks, so getting one online might not be a big issue
2013-01-26 01:32:50	R1cochet	nils_2: u bastard :(
2013-01-26 01:33:10	R1cochet	pbos: u cant get one in sweden?
2013-01-26 01:33:20	pbos	R1cochet: they're supposed to be cheaper in the us :)
2013-01-26 01:33:29	R1cochet	nils_2: they used to have air shows at military base near me. then they closed the air base :(
2013-01-26 01:33:33	pbos	with the dollar being cheap and all
2013-01-26 01:33:39	R1cochet	loved watching the blue angels from my backyard every year
2013-01-26 01:33:44	R1cochet	aww gotcha
2013-01-26 01:33:46	nils_2	funny thing over all (don't know if its still possible), i went to the coast guard and they only made a copy from my passport. not very much security
2013-01-26 01:33:55	R1cochet	well, ritzcamera is nice camera store.
2013-01-26 01:34:04	R1cochet	but Costco has good deals on nikon and canon
2013-01-26 01:34:07	R1cochet	w/ lenses
2013-01-26 01:34:22	R1cochet	u need costco membership though :(
2013-01-26 01:34:25	pbos	is costco online?
2013-01-26 01:34:52	R1cochet	yes
2013-01-26 01:34:57	R1cochet	but you still need membership card
2013-01-26 01:35:04	R1cochet	and it costs ~$50
2013-01-26 01:35:10	R1cochet	so if u know someone w/ a card do it
2013-01-26 01:35:13	R1cochet	otherwise not worth it
2013-01-26 01:35:38	R1cochet	heres 3 sites that are trustworthy http://www.ritzcamera.com/ http://www.bhphotovideo.com/ http://www.samys.com/
2013-01-26 01:35:45	R1cochet	i think i ordered mine from samys

2013-01-26 01:36:50	R1cochet	walmart actually carries some DSLR's
2013-01-26 01:36:58	R1cochet	but the low end, not worth it imo
2013-01-26 01:37:06	R1cochet	i can ask my bro in law
2013-01-26 01:37:13	R1cochet	he's a pro photographer
2013-01-26 01:37:18	R1cochet	so he claims LMFAO
2013-01-26 01:37:29	pbos	just getting the camera body isn't that much cheaper there
2013-01-26 01:37:46	R1cochet	pbos: http://www.costco.com/digital-slr-cameras.html
2013-01-26 01:37:55	pbos	uh, or well, a bit

2013-01-26 01:39:14	pbos	f/3.5-5.6G
2013-01-26 01:39:17	R1cochet	cant be bothered to focus or stabalize myself
2013-01-26 01:39:20	pbos	vs. f/1.4
2013-01-26 01:39:41	R1cochet	also some stores will bargain with you.
2013-01-26 01:39:49	R1cochet	but beware. if the deal sounds to good it is
2013-01-26 01:40:00	R1cochet	especially in a place like SF
2013-01-26 01:40:03	R1cochet	some shady mofos there
2013-01-26 01:40:24	pbos	lol
2013-01-26 01:40:33	R1cochet	u might want to ask some people while ur in town if they can recommend a good store. but ask lots of people and go w/ the one most people recommend
2013-01-26 01:40:37	pbos	seems like you've had good experience with SF people
2013-01-26 01:40:47	pbos	yeah, I'll check with the ones working there

2013-01-26 01:41:16	pbos	then I'll check prices here, and see if I can find them significantly cheaper over there
2013-01-26 01:41:32	pbos	a smaller shop or a major player?
2013-01-26 01:41:34	R1cochet	13mp see its good. naw id rather go w/ the brand i know thats only 5mp
2013-01-26 01:41:48	R1cochet	major player = ur not getting robbed
2013-01-26 01:41:57	R1cochet	small shop = can probably bargain w/ them
2013-01-26 01:42:04	R1cochet	but might be counterfeit shit
2013-01-26 01:42:07	R1cochet	lol
2013-01-26 01:42:18	pbos	are there really high-quality counterfeits?
2013-01-26 01:42:29	pbos	otherwise I should be able to tell a nikon one from a fake one
2013-01-26 01:42:49	R1cochet	dunno. im just not so trusting when it comes to being on vacation
2013-01-26 01:43:01	pbos	yeah, of course

2013-01-26 07:12:57	BullShark	FiXato -> are you new to irc?
2013-01-26 07:13:38	BullShark	FiXato -> you want the ip of irc.esper.net?
2013-01-26 07:13:44	BullShark	FiXato -> ping irc.esper.net
2013-01-26 07:14:07	FiXato	BullShark, are you new to how DNS round-robins work?
2013-01-26 07:14:12	BullShark	FiXato -> likely using load balancing and not a single server. i think that would be pretty rare for an irc network.
2013-01-26 07:15:13	BullShark	FiXato -> as i just told you, 
2013-01-26 07:15:16	BullShark	load balancing
2013-01-26 07:15:26	BullShark	FiXato -> l2dig

2013-01-26 07:18:06	@FlashCode	FiXato: not easy to see IP, because connection is made in a forked process
2013-01-26 07:18:15	@FlashCode	so when connected, you got the IP back (and it's displayed)
2013-01-26 07:18:20	FiXato	I *know* which A records are set for irc.esper.net, and thus which UPS it *can* resolve to. My question, to FlashCode, was if it were possible for weechat to show which IP it was trying to connect to, instead of only showing that after a completely successful connection was established. 
2013-01-26 07:18:41	@FlashCode	the IP is chose by the child process, not parent
2013-01-26 07:18:44	FiXato	ah, thanks FlashCode :)
2013-01-26 07:20:21	FiXato	however, I would appreciate more detailed info to be shown in case a connection could not be established. For instance, if the host could not be resolved, or why the connection was refused (and which IP that was)
2013-01-26 07:20:46	FiXato	is it not possible for that forked process to return that info as well?
2013-01-26 07:20:55	@FlashCode	pbos: for the new doc toc, it's not a frame, but just css (but result on screen is similar)
2013-01-26 07:21:22	@FlashCode	FiXato: yes in case of error, such info can be reported by child process I think
2013-01-26 07:21:45	FiXato	then I'll add a task ;p

2013-01-26 14:03:52	frojnd	What's the difference?
2013-01-26 14:03:55	nils_2	by default aspell suggestions are off. 3 means you will get three suggestions
2013-01-26 14:04:02	frojnd	nils_2: ok :) 
2013-01-26 14:04:41	frojnd	Let's try how it is with three different suggestions 
2013-01-26 14:04:57	frojnd	And then just enter when there is a correct suggestion :) Nice!
2013-01-26 14:05:44	frojnd	OK or just space so I can continue to type :)
2013-01-26 14:05:48	nils_2	ahimsa: filtering irc_MODE will only filter message with the tag "irc_MODE", nothing else.
2013-01-26 14:06:15	ahimsa	nils_2: yes, but what messages get the tag irc_mode? :)
2013-01-26 14:06:18	nils_2	ahimsa: don't use google, use weechat docs (or this channel)
2013-01-26 14:06:27	nils_2	!docs
2013-01-26 14:06:32	nils_2	!doc
2013-01-26 14:06:32	+weebot	WeeChat doc: http://weechat.org/doc
2013-01-26 14:06:57	nils_2	channel mode messages. /mode +n  for example
2013-01-26 14:07:49	ahimsa	Well, the user guide doesn't have anything on irc_mode, and FAQ has this entry http://weechat.org/files/doc/weechat_faq.en.html#filter_voice_messages which is why I asked if it'll affect other lines besides those /mode commands.
2013-01-26 14:08:02	nils_2	like those messages: Modus #channel [+n] durch nils_2
2013-01-26 14:08:42	nils_2	not all messages will be listed in doc. there are hundreds of irc messages ;-)
2013-01-26 14:09:16	nils_2	if you want to know what messages will be send/receive look at "/server raw"
2013-01-26 14:09:26	nils_2	or "/debug tags"
2013-01-26 14:09:29	ahimsa	Are you suggesting google doesn't index weechat docs?
2013-01-26 14:10:29	nils_2	i don't know, but google is less helpful than using the docs directly.
2013-01-26 14:10:55	ahimsa	ANyway, let's see if this works now. Thanks.
2013-01-26 14:11:20	nils_2	you're welcome
2013-01-26 14:11:23	ahimsa	nils_2: and in this case, neither google nor docs was able to tell me to use irc_mode :)

2013-01-27 11:48:24	R1cochet	JyZyXEL: you can alternately do /python unload weeget
2013-01-27 11:48:35	JyZyXEL	thats the old way
2013-01-27 11:48:56	R1cochet	using /script command you need full file name
2013-01-27 11:48:59	R1cochet	lol if you say so
2013-01-27 11:50:37	nils_2	JyZyXEL: and if you are also using the "script.pl" script, remove it, too ;-)
2013-01-27 11:50:45	JyZyXEL	i gotta be careful with the upgrade features because i probably have some scripts that i have modified myself and forgotten all about it :D
2013-01-27 11:51:34	nils_2	with the /script plugin you can "hold" scripts, not to be overwritten/updated
2013-01-27 11:51:41	R1cochet	/script buffer should state if its modified
2013-01-27 11:52:31	nils_2	and if the script update is useful, why not uploading to weechat.org?
2013-01-27 11:53:35	JyZyXEL	well for example i think im running a URL shortenizer script modified to work with my own server

2013-01-27 12:00:41	nyuszika7h	how do you install a plugin?
2013-01-27 12:01:17	nils_2	/plugin load 
2013-01-27 12:01:39	nyuszika7h	but where to put it?
2013-01-27 12:02:04	R1cochet	you have to compile them first iirc
2013-01-27 12:02:14	nyuszika7h	I did
2013-01-27 12:02:16	R1cochet	nyuszika7h: do you mean a script instead of plugin?
2013-01-27 12:02:19	StarWeaver	there are no available plugins that aren't part of the distibution
2013-01-27 12:02:19	nyuszika7h	nope
2013-01-27 12:02:24	R1cochet	ok
2013-01-27 12:02:24	StarWeaver	afaik
2013-01-27 12:02:26	nyuszika7h	I made a plugin myself
2013-01-27 12:02:26	nils_2	depends on how you installed weechat.
2013-01-27 12:02:31	nyuszika7h	from git
2013-01-27 12:02:37	nyuszika7h	installed from git, I mena
2013-01-27 12:02:38	nyuszika7h	* mean
2013-01-27 12:03:02	nyuszika7h	I used  clang -I$HOME/src/git/sv.gnu.org/weechat/src/plugins -shared -fPIC -Wall -o flutter.so flutter.c  to compile it

2013-01-27 12:04:38	nils_2	have a look in /your-weechat-git/lib/weechat/plugins
2013-01-27 12:05:19	nyuszika7h	hmm, using absolute path works too
2013-01-27 12:05:21	nyuszika7h	with /plugin load
2013-01-27 12:06:14	nils_2	yes. /plugin, /script, /perl, /python using absolute pathes, too
