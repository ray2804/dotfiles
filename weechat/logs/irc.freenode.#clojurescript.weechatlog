2013-08-31 09:11:41	ILoveMilka	My inferior-lisp-program is "lein trampoline cljsbuild repl-listen". So I have this magic inferior-lisp buffer, when I enter an expression and RET after it, I can see the results in the browser at localhost:3000/repl-demo (see http://bit.ly/16Y8B9E)
2013-08-31 09:13:02	ILoveMilka	Now, the problem is, I obviously want clojure-mode in that buffer, but when I do M-x clojure-mode, the buffer loses its special powers; expressions are not even evaluated anymore on RET
