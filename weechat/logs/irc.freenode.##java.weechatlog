2013-01-19 14:17:52	iron_houzi	dreamreal: Thanks!
2013-01-19 14:18:30	@dreamreal	do you understand why?
2013-01-19 14:19:10	iron_houzi	Yes, because the object pointers are compared by checking if they point to the same memory address
2013-01-19 14:19:19	acuzio	object pointers ?
2013-01-19 14:19:47	@dreamreal	yes, and why do you want equals() instead? (And in java they're "references," not pointers.)
2013-01-19 14:20:10	@dreamreal	the concepts are *very* similar, but references aren't memory locations, and you can't do math on them.
2013-01-19 14:21:12	iron_houzi	under the hood their still pointers :) I see from the Java source code that equals() take objects, but please enlighten me as to why I specifically need to use the equals() method.
2013-01-19 14:21:24	iron_houzi	s/their/they're
2013-01-19 14:21:42	@dreamreal	iron_houzi: try math on them. Or assigning to them like you would a pointer. or, heck, dereferencing them.
2013-01-19 14:21:57	@dreamreal	They're not pointers. You can call them that, but they're not.
2013-01-19 14:22:05	@dreamreal	Why do YOU think equals() is better?
2013-01-19 14:24:27	iron_houzi	OK. References. I can assume that the regular comparison operators only work on primitives while objects require different checking, hence the equals() method ..?
2013-01-19 14:25:18	@dreamreal	iron_houzi: here's a scenario. Imagine class Person {String ssn; Person(String ssn) { this.ssn=ssn; } }
2013-01-19 14:25:39	iron_houzi	ok
2013-01-19 14:25:43	@dreamreal	now: Person a=new Person("111-11-1111"); Person b=new Person("111-11-1111");
2013-01-19 14:25:51	@dreamreal	two different references no?
2013-01-19 14:25:52	idletask	http://pastie.org/5725045 <-- is this a correct way to wrap exceptions?
2013-01-19 14:25:55	iron_houzi	yes
2013-01-19 14:25:58	iron_houzi	absolutely
2013-01-19 14:26:05	@dreamreal	iron_houzi: so a==b is *false*, right?
2013-01-19 14:26:41	@dreamreal	even though the ssns match and this should, in fact, be the same person

2013-01-19 14:27:04	idletask	iron_houzi: == compares references, .equals() compares values -- and .equals() is paired with .hashCode()
2013-01-19 14:27:13	iron_houzi	sorry '=='

2013-01-19 14:27:27	iron_houzi	cool!
2013-01-19 14:28:16	@dreamreal	what Person.equals(Object o) would do is first check type "if(!o instanceof Person) { return false; }" (assuming subtypes are allowed)
2013-01-19 14:28:49	iron_houzi	but isn't that the same as checking the reference?

2013-01-19 14:31:06	@dreamreal	iron_houzi: so if you malloc(12) and strcpy "hello" to it, a!=b, still.

2013-01-19 14:39:31	UltraMC	dreamreal, doesnt mean it not sux
2013-01-19 14:39:32	iron_houzi	So I am understanding it correctly that ==/!= checks the actual pointer and equals() checks the reference - and I should be using equals() because even though the pointers can be different, they can still have the same reference .. Did I get it?
2013-01-19 14:39:37	@dreamreal	angie: java.lang.Integer is automatically imported. You don't have to import it at all. And the actual property may not be MAX_INT.

2013-01-19 14:42:35	@dreamreal	iron_houzi: no. == and != check the reference. It's not a pointer.
2013-01-19 14:42:56	@dreamreal	equals() is a method, period, whose declared purpose is to say whether the two references refer to the same conceptual object.
2013-01-19 14:43:26	iron_houzi	Ahh! Thank you for making that crystal clear.
2013-01-19 14:43:33	idletask	iron_houzi: I told you to "think of Java references as C pointers"
2013-01-19 14:43:45	idletask	As far as == and != are concerned
2013-01-19 14:43:50	iron_houzi	idletask: ..even though they are not..
2013-01-19 14:44:17	@dreamreal	I'd tell you not to do that. They're not pointers. They share very few concepts with pointers.
2013-01-19 14:44:20	idletask	Even though they are not, yes, they are not named like that -- and you don't have "reference arithmetic" either
2013-01-19 14:45:17	iron_houzi	I'm just thinking that Java was probably written in C and that C would have to use pointers to solve these things under the hood anyways ..
2013-01-19 14:45:27	@dreamreal	you're incorrect.
2013-01-19 14:45:31	iron_houzi	OK
2013-01-19 14:45:57	@dreamreal	It was written in C++ - so you were close there - but it never shared this concept with C or C++. In fact, part of its design was to NOT share this concept, on purpose.
2013-01-19 14:46:18	iron_houzi	Interesting.
2013-01-19 14:46:48	idletask	In fact, from what I have read, some of the Java language design was inspired by Objective C...

2013-01-19 21:31:49	@cheeser	the fact that they're called "references" does not make java pass by reference.  it makes java pass *a* reference.
2013-01-19 21:32:08	@cheeser	so when you pass a reference to a method, you have two distinct references to the same object.
2013-01-19 21:32:40	@cheeser	so you can mutate taht object and it will be visible outside the method, but you can't change that reference value in the method and expect to have it change the reference you passed in
