2013-08-31 13:00:07	augustl	all I need is to be able to create a queue, publish messages to it, and have all listeners to that queue get those messages. Could just write one myself ;)

2013-08-31 13:06:37	RLa	augustl, what about eventemitter?
2013-08-31 13:06:53	RLa	or do you need a persistent queue?
2013-08-31 13:07:14	augustl	RLa: I guess I could use an event emitter with just one event, yeah
2013-08-31 13:07:17	aortmann	any Idea why I get on my zabbix server "Received value [C:\Development\private\aortmann\check-receive-folder\index.js:19	 var filesCreatedDate = new Date(stats.ctime)" and on my own computer I can easy run this?
2013-08-31 13:07:18	augustl	no need for being persistent
2013-08-31 13:07:39	RLa	btw, if you have large messages you should move them into gc-less env
2013-08-31 13:07:54	RLa	or rather lots of messages
2013-08-31 13:07:58	augustl	they're not large, they're mostly just various FYIs and heartbeats
2013-08-31 13:08:14	Industrial	Anyone have experience with levelgraph and levelgraph-n3? I'm getting a OpenError: IO error: /Users/tomwieland/Documents/Personal/levelgraph-test/servers/http-server/databases/n3/test/LOCK: No such file or directory but tht db isn't even created yet. the lib is supposed to create the lock file etc.
2013-08-31 13:08:23	augustl	RLa: going down into C++ is the only way to get gc-less I guess
2013-08-31 13:08:24	augustl	?
2013-08-31 13:08:35	RLa	augustl, or external service
2013-08-31 13:08:51	RLa	i think same applies for caching

2013-08-31 16:14:00	Lope	Industrial: yes I've played around with the recommended cluster setup.
2013-08-31 16:14:30	Lope	It works perfectly. I was just thinking perhaps I should use a load balancer and run each worker on a separate port.

2013-08-31 16:15:27	Lope	But upon further contemplation I realized node is not designed for heavy computation, the computation is supposed to happen elsewhere, and node is supposed to be non-blocking. So I doubt any advanced load balancing is necessary.

2013-08-31 16:17:05	Industrial	seaport returns all matching services for a name, so I could do load balancing that way, but I could also just spawn workers in the service. I'm not sure either.

2013-09-02 15:20:24	kenansulayman	What you could do, if you like the Heroku platform — I'm the maintainer of uberlevel (lmdb+levelup). It's backing FineDB & a fork of Redis. You could host the db on an instance and deploy over Heroku
2013-09-02 15:20:45	deathmtn	Up until now, I've just developed locally and then pushed to Heroku and not given any other thought to deployment.
2013-09-02 15:21:23	kenansulayman	You should weight off the best options for your case. Instances can be really expensive. Also you should check if LevelDB applies best to your case

2013-09-02 16:21:17	Industrial	I'm not really sure I understand how single page app routing works on the server. Basically all I have to expose on my server is a route to '/' that rewrites the url to '/index.html' so it gets picked up by the static server, and all the other routes are static routes.

2013-09-07 18:30:22	shafox	can someone take a look at this files and tell me whats wrong cause i cant find any but getting not the result i want . https://gist.github.com/shadow-fox/6476965
2013-09-07 18:30:32	tarruda	 I'm working on a key/value store called 'archdb'. I've written a small specification document describing how it should work when its 100% complete: https://github.com/tarruda/archdb/blob/master/doc/description.mkd
2013-09-07 18:30:58	tarruda	if anyone is interested, feel free to get in touch. I would like to have some help
2013-09-07 18:31:00	Sorella	shafox, I think you're misunderstanding what Grunt is. It doesn't do *anything* besides running tasks. It won't concatenate your files, it won't minify them, it won't compile resources. Nothing. You have to find the tasks that do that and use them.

2013-09-07 18:31:58	Sorella	shafox, you're not using a task that minifies JS files, like the grunt-contrib-uglify, thus no files will get minified.
2013-09-07 18:32:45	shafox	Sorella: I have followed this repo for the gruntfile.js https://github.com/alexanderbeletsky/backbone-express-spa and here it does without any requiring uglify

2013-09-07 18:33:25	Sorella	shafox, then it uses another task that does the same thing. Grunt by itself does nothing.
2013-09-07 18:33:34	Sorella	Literally, nothing.

2013-09-07 20:20:14	WillHPower	Does anyone know the appropriate usages of process.nextTick()? The api docs say you should use it when a function may pass its callback to an async function or call it synchronously depending on some condition. But I've seen others say using nextTick() in this situation can be inefficient, and should only be used in situations where you need to give the calling context a chance to do something before the callback is called,

2013-09-07 21:49:01	@isaacbw	Sorella: only in that both have closures which are nice
2013-09-07 21:49:04	shama	isaacbw: ha
2013-09-07 21:49:08	@isaacbw	and first class functions
2013-09-07 21:49:24	kenansulayman	Is there a way to dump v8's internal assembly?
2013-09-07 21:49:30	Sorella	LISP didn't have closures and was still a Lisp though ;)
2013-09-07 21:50:02	@isaacbw	I assume when people talk about javascript being lisp, they mean closure semantics from modern lisps
2013-09-07 21:50:02	Sorella	Though closures and 1st-class functions are nice. Every language has them now though.
2013-09-07 21:50:45	@isaacbw	java is supposed to get them soon I think, even
2013-09-07 21:51:04	mscdex	kenansulayman: yes, but i think the v8 disassembler is not built-in by default

2013-09-07 23:03:09	Sorella	Pent, it basically comes down to: if you allow `bar` in <foo>{ bar }</foo> to be plain HTML, you risk XSS attacks. If you always entity-encode `bar`, you can't abstract over that expression (you can't use snippets). So neither of these solutions are good.

2013-09-07 23:10:52	Sorella	Pent, I can give you one. Suppose you have snippet A which is "<li>Some item" That's a perfectly fine HTML snippet on its own, it means "<li>Some item</li>". Then you have snippet B, which is: "<div>foo</div>". When you concatenate A and B, you get "<li>Some item<div>foo</div>" and not "<li>Some item</li><div>foo</div>"
2013-09-07 23:11:10	Sorella	Those are two different things, you broke the rules of HTML when you composed those snippets.
2013-09-07 23:11:15	Pent	i think that it's your responsibility to close tags...
2013-09-07 23:11:44	Pent	that breaks in normal html, why not in templates?

2013-09-08 01:00:11	nikolayhg	Question about npm registry. I npm published the plugin 'grunt-files-to-json-appender' in version 0.1.0 and wrong GitHub repository. Then I fixed the repository and published version 0.1.1. The new version is shown in the search results https://npmjs.org/search?q=grunt-files-to-json-appender but it is not shown in the package page: https://npmjs.org/package/grunt-files-to-json-appender
2013-09-08 01:00:29	nikolayhg	can I do something about it, or just wait?
2013-09-08 01:01:58	nikolayhg	I just found out that in another browser is it showing the new version. But not in the browser I opened it before.

2013-09-08 03:59:13	rhodesjason	one might call that "over-optimization"
2013-09-08 03:59:24	Aredridel	It makes sites feel local.
2013-09-08 03:59:39	Aredridel	It's possible. It means having datacenters near the users -- that's faster than light speed across the planet.

2013-09-08 04:01:36	superjoe	are you kidding? it's gotta be more like 200ms

2013-09-08 04:01:42	Aredridel	Depends on what you mean by 'notice'

2013-09-08 04:01:49	hexacode	anyone know the proper way to serve static files with node.js  and not with expressjs included....do i read a file, then response.write it?
2013-09-08 04:02:07	Aredridel	Read the Amazon talks about this. They measured how page load times affected spending. It was dramatic.

2013-09-08 04:03:15	Aredridel	Though not needed with chunked encoding.

2013-09-08 04:03:55	Aredridel	Anyway, 200 ms is the threshold above which users become aware that there's a lag. 
2013-09-08 04:04:09	Aredridel	Below that, improvements are still notable, but it's subconscious.
2013-09-08 04:04:29	Aredridel	There's higher thresholds -- where users start noticing notable slowness, or start getting frustrated.

2013-09-08 09:30:55	teemujin	zomg: its not hard - its just out of your control if you can't see whats going on

2013-09-08 15:49:30	machty	you can write all your ember code in a single js file if you really wanted to
2013-09-08 15:49:53	caitp	but you don't want to :p
2013-09-08 15:49:58	machty	confirm
2013-09-08 15:50:11	machty	but the way you write ember code is very convention-over-configuration, like rails in that way

2013-09-08 17:26:46	superjoe	but the problem is all state is lost when the process exits
2013-09-08 17:27:10	andur	you could json.stringify and save to file, then on startup load file, parse and carry on
2013-09-08 17:27:14	andur	or just use a db
2013-09-08 17:27:22	superjoe	redis is like one step away from that. it's like in-memory state, but it exists in a different process
2013-09-08 17:27:40	Xymon	I'm using Json files for memory.
2013-09-08 17:27:47	Xymon	:p
2013-09-08 17:28:01	superjoe	so every time someone chats you write the entire chat history to disk?
2013-09-08 17:28:19	Xymon	no hell no.
2013-09-08 17:29:45	Xymon	it saves periodically. I think on join/leave events... don't remember entirely.
2013-09-08 17:30:14	superjoe	yeah. I think you'd have better performance and reliability with redis
2013-09-08 17:30:33	superjoe	this is a classic use case
2013-09-08 17:30:51	Xymon	in the case of what? multiple servers, single servers or both?
2013-09-08 17:31:12	foofoobar	I want to use an array of data on the server side (expressjs) and on the client side (angularjs). I created a file with the content "window.varname = [...];" so I can put this file in a <script> tag and use window.varname
2013-09-08 17:31:14	superjoe	it would work identically with both
2013-09-08 17:31:18	foofoobar	However.. I cant use this file in nodejs then
2013-09-08 17:31:22	foofoobar	What can I do ?

I know that open files, open sockets, timeouts still waiting to happen, time intervals, event emitters with listeners make my node program not exit... but some times it's hard to find which of these and where is happening.

2013-09-10 06:36:24	markcl	so doesnt that mean it's not installed
2013-09-10 06:36:38	RangerMauve	markcl: What's your node_modules folder look like?
2013-09-10 06:36:49	RangerMauve	SinnerNyx: I think it's because they take the session from Connect

2013-09-10 06:37:10	SinnerNyx	Oh, good. I'll look up their docs on the matter then. Thanks for the help RangerMauve
2013-09-10 06:37:16	othiym23	it sounds like you may have a module in an in-between state

2013-09-10 13:13:25	faraway	When i use fork to start a child process i know i can listen for SIGTERM in the parent and if it was told to exit, and the exit the child too. But if the parent exits by a SIGKILL i also need to exit the child. In other languages I could either periodically check the ppid in the child if it changed (but i cant find ppid in node) or i listen to an open pipe of the parent and if this closes i know the parent exited with a SIGKILL

This 'other_http_package' has the same api as the original one ('http'), so the rest of my_module's code remains ontouch. What could I do? It is necessary to fork the whole my_module to change one single line, or is another way to do this? Hints?

2013-09-10 23:28:10	chapel	in my head I was thinking more along the lines that var value = fn() would return a getter, that would call next when value was accessed
2013-09-10 23:28:26	chapel	but honestly that sounds off when I tried write it in code
2013-09-10 23:28:36	spion	but you don't get the value on that side, just the yielded asyncFn(args)

2013-09-10 23:29:05	spion	on that side (the generator runner) you need to set up a callback

2013-09-11 06:32:36	sinclair|net	so, my question is, given that there are so many nodejs application now out there in the wild, what is the quality of these code bases, also who is going to manage them.
2013-09-11 06:32:44	jned	with apache you can only use 1 ssl certificate per domain on a single ip, but with Node, can you use use 1 certificate for multimple domains on a single ip?
2013-09-11 06:32:49	sinclair|net	does anyone care about that?

2013-09-11 06:57:08	ruquay	sinclair|net: well, node.js has been good for me for the time being. probably most people hang around this channel to try to help others do some task in node, or find some help themselves. you can probably guess that continuing a 'the sky is falling' speech might not be the best way to make friends here. if the sky is falling, maybe show us where the shelter is instead?

2013-09-11 06:59:38	FMJaggy	does TypeScript give you what you want, or is that still a stepping stone? i'm not familiar with it, but i do share your base concern
2013-09-11 06:59:51	sinclair|net	FMJaggy: thanks
2013-09-11 07:00:09	sinclair|net	and no, TS doesn't solve everything, it just help with managing large codebases however. 
2013-09-11 07:00:18	FMJaggy	in that i sometimes want to choose node, but i always have to consider who is working on it, and whether it will bite me later
2013-09-11 07:00:22	Lorentz	I just think it's more that we don't have de facto way of doing x things
2013-09-11 07:00:32	Lorentz	instead we can use any of dozens of modules to do the same thing

2013-09-11 15:50:50	huf	yes, those two are entirely orthogonal features
2013-09-11 15:50:58	spion	you could forbid shadowing if you want but still require people to use var (and throw an error if that variable name is already in use)

2013-09-11 15:51:31	huf	the declaration isnt really for the compiler, it's for you

2013-09-11 15:53:01	spion	instead of happily assigning to the previously defined variable
