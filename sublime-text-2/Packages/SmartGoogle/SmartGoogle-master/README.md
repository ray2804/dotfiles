# Sublime Text 2 SmartGoogle Plugin

SmartGoogle allows you to search Google with the press of a button.  What makes it smart?  SmartGoogle automatically prefixes your search with your currently selected syntax.  It makes getting quick, meaningfull responses even quicker.

SmartGoogle was inspired by Eric Martel's wonderful [StackOverflow](https://github.com/ericmartel/Sublime-Text-2-Stackoverflow-Plugin) plugin.  If you enjoyed SmartGoogle, make sure to check his plugin out!
