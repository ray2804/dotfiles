2013-08-31 11:01:23	s4muel	sojacques: if you're looking for Clojure's "Rails", no, there isn't one -- and it wouldn't really be very idiomatic.
2013-08-31 11:02:00	sojacques	I'm not looking for rails, but as I saw compojure and korma, I thought that maybe someone made something to generate code
2013-08-31 11:02:17	sojacques	I'm against the idea of a monolithic framework, and more looking for simple tools

2013-08-31 14:12:58	llasram	sheldonh: Because the `& b` means "accept any number of additional arguments and return them as a list".  So each call is (effectively) wrapping the second argument in a second layer of list
2013-08-31 14:13:31	sheldonh	llasram: argh! like a splat in the languages i'm used to. okay thanks!
2013-08-31 14:13:54	llasram	sheldonh: Np.  Something else to note in your function is that Clojure has what's called "nil punning"
2013-08-31 14:14:19	--	kofno_ is now known as kofno
2013-08-31 14:14:20	llasram	The `nil` value isn't *identical* to an empty list (like it is in some Lisps), but you can generally treat it as one

2013-09-02 07:34:58	callen	Raynes: Korma is fine.
2013-09-02 07:35:04	Raynes	So is SQL.
2013-09-02 07:35:10	Raynes	So why not just write SQL? :(
2013-09-02 07:35:56	ddellacosta	callen: so, sounds like we know about the same amount about it…d'oh.
2013-09-02 07:36:04	Raynes	The thing about these crazy ass DSLs is that they're designed to provide flexibility that nobody actually uses.

2013-09-02 07:36:35	ddellacosta	Raynes: the answer is that it is handy to have a DSL to generate SQL for you when you are repetitively doing something specific for your domain model
2013-09-02 07:36:46	callen	I need to down a few shots of scotch and then I'll be okay, just give me a minute.
2013-09-02 07:36:53	ddellacosta	callen: hehe
2013-09-02 07:36:59	Raynes	You don't need a DSL for that, you need mustache.

2013-09-02 07:37:46	ddellacosta	now now you two
2013-09-02 07:37:50	aaelony	fwiw, I typically  leave SQL as a string but have different functions for potential where clauses
2013-09-02 07:37:52	Raynes	It's a perfectly suitable solution to this problem.
2013-09-02 07:38:09	ddellacosta	Raynes: it leaves out a lot of the stuff in between, like, validation
2013-09-02 07:38:12	callen	Raynes: mustache is not an acceptable way to structure or manage SQL queries.
2013-09-02 07:38:34	Raynes	I certainly don't think writing it in a Clojure DSL is a suitable way either.

2013-09-02 14:13:55	manutter	I think it's just a convenience. The "dirtiness" of global vars comes from bugs that arise when different parts of the system change the global in different ways

2013-09-02 14:14:09	manutter	but the system in this case doesn't even know about the var
2013-09-02 14:14:26	manutter	It's only ever referenced from the repl, by the developer.
2013-09-02 14:14:51	noidi	yeah, maybe it's ok to think of it as a constant
2013-09-02 14:15:04	manutter	I think of it as a developer tool rather than as code

2013-09-03 18:08:44	technomancy	you can embed nrepl in an application easily enough though
2013-09-03 18:08:52	futile	Basically I'm wondering if I can deploy just an uberjar (per your mailing-list email on Aug 19) and still use lein repl in production.
2013-09-03 18:09:18	technomancy	futile: you would do `lein repl :connect $PORT` rather than `lein repl` but it should still work
2013-09-03 18:09:28	technomancy	or `grench repl` =)

2013-09-07 08:48:01	sdegutis	So for [1 2 3 4 5] you'd get ((0 1 2) (1 2 3) (2 3 4) (3 4 5)), and then you partition it again to get (((0 1 2) (1 2 3) (2 3 4)) ((1 2 3) (2 3 4) (3 4 5)))

2013-09-07 08:50:04	sdegutis	Actually no, because then your next set-triple will still have dups. This plan no worky.
2013-09-07 08:50:07	amalloy	johnmn3: you really shouldn't use (> x (count coll)) unless you know coll is counted - it breaks on infinite seqs, and is unnecessarily slow for large, finite sequences

2013-09-07 09:03:22	ddellacosta	sometimes my repl just freezes, there is some key command (ctrl-<something>) I'm doing to cause it, but I can't do anything without killing it and restarting the repl

2013-09-07 09:05:20	amalloy	so...surely you have readline support, at least, right?

2013-09-07 09:06:48	amalloy	i'm just trying to rule out the possibility that it's your tty STOP character, ddellacosta (which is C-s in most non-readline instances)
2013-09-07 09:06:58	amalloy	if it's that, C-q should free it back up

2013-09-07 09:08:49	amalloy	if you're already happy with emacs, slime (or i guess nrepl these days, though i still prefer the Old Ways) is so so much better than a standalone repl
2013-09-07 09:10:02	ddellacosta	amalloy: it's really stupid but I haven't bothered yet because I don't know all the key bindings to push stuff to the repl, and I find it really frustrating looking at the repl always at the bottom of the buffer--I'm constantly hitting ctrl-l in my terminal.  I'm sure it's just configuration but it's something I'll have to sit down and figure out, and since what I have works quite well, I haven't tried yet.  But there are a number of
2013-09-07 09:10:02	ddellacosta	reasons I really need to give it a shot.

2013-09-07 09:11:50	amalloy	respectively, those are: eval entire file; eval one form; switch to repl buffer; set repl namespace to current file's namespace

2013-09-07 09:23:11	clojurebot	flatten is rarely the right answer. Suppose you need to use a list as your "base type", for example. Usually you only want to flatten a single level, and in that case you're better off with concat. Or, better still, use mapcat to produce a sequence that's shaped right to begin with.

2013-09-07 21:22:21	bbloom	headius: I guess it boils down to this for me: If I'm gonna start a new project that needs to be fast/concurrent, then Ruby (be it MRI or JRuby) is not an ideal choice because of weak concurrency support in the language and ecosystem
2013-09-07 21:22:23	headius	as bbloom says...Ruby has its place, and there's a lot you can do in Ruby even with the mutability tarpit
2013-09-07 21:23:03	headius	bbloom: sure, I agree in general... but if you're going to start a new project that needs to fast/concurrent and you want to use Ruby, JRuby would be the better of the two choices

2013-09-07 21:23:26	bbloom	headius: If I'm porting an application to a faster host, I expect very-high compatibility with low cost of porting, but I don't get that: I get serious library compatibility issues and dramatically slower startup time (and i view fast startup time as a primary reason to use ruby, which rails kills too)
2013-09-07 21:23:53	bbloom	headius: being the better of two choices in a sea of 100s of choices seems moot
2013-09-07 21:24:03	bbloom	particularly when scala & clojure are right next door....
2013-09-07 21:24:21	headius	well...as I said, if you *want* to use Ruby, there's not 100s of choices
2013-09-07 21:24:38	headius	whether Ruby is the right choice in the first place is a debate I won't get into

Streams are a special case of asynchronous messaging for a use case that, in my recent opinion, is less common than general communicating services.

I get what you're saying here in that it's impure because it's not the result of a computation, it's a side effect like 'create another lightweight process'. I think that's what you're saying.

2013-09-08 00:13:35	SegFaultAX	Most of the time that's a closed phase, the compiler is a black box until run time.
2013-09-08 00:14:10	gfredericks	SegFaultAX: but if you talk about it that way it sounds as if it can only be terribly hard; not that you're just writing regular code and dealing with familiar data
2013-09-08 00:14:12	SegFaultAX	gfredericks: Second biggest hurdle is the idea of processing unevaluated lisp forms. There just isn't really anything like it in languages that don't support proper first class macros.
2013-09-08 00:14:15	llasram	irctc: That was a change in... Clojure 1.3?  Before then all vars were dynamic.  So probably older books

2013-09-08 01:35:15	llasram	sontek: That's not the approach of core.async, but something similar is possible on the JVM: http://blog.paralleluniverse.co/post/49445260575/quasar-pulsar
2013-09-08 01:35:31	SegFaultAX	sontek: That's the thing, many Java webservers are threaded. So the blocking issue doesn't matter since you're only blocking that one thread for that one request.

2013-09-08 05:08:11	sontek	just that it has to be ran by its own async-server instead of jetty?
2013-09-08 05:08:14	callen	sontek: uhm, you don't want to use thread-local state in http-kit. That's a blocker for some people, not for others.

2013-09-08 05:08:27	akurilin	callen, I'm looking at the leiningen "specification" and it seems to support 4 default paths: source, java source, test and resource. Shouldn't those be considered "default"?

2013-09-08 07:53:16	ddellacosta_	sdegutis: I think there is a natural reaction from some of us when we hear of "one more docs site" regardless of how good an idea it is….so, just saying.  Again, I really don't want you to feel like I'm shutting you down, as I think I did last time.
2013-09-08 07:53:38	seancorfield	one of the big benefits of clojuredocs is that it is searchable and it includes contrib libraries
2013-09-08 07:53:42	ddellacosta_	sdegutis: It's more that, I think your solution is probably excellent--already it's nice to have the wiki with all the functions there updated for 1.5.1
2013-09-08 07:53:44	sdegutis	ddellacosta_: That time you had legit points. :)

2013-09-08 07:54:10	ddellacosta_	sdegutis: right--so get some feedback on the mailing list.
2013-09-08 07:54:19	seancorfield	any docs site that has a chance of being taken seriously has to include the active contrib modules as well and have a good search feature
2013-09-08 07:54:44	ddellacosta_	sdegutis: for example, as nice as what you've got there already, you are going to have a hard time pulling me away from clojuredocs.org without being much closer to feature-parity

2013-09-08 08:50:29	andyfingerhut	clojure.string/replace is definitely implemented so that when it finds a match, it does not look for another match within the replacement, but only starts looking for another match after the end of the previous match.

2013-09-08 08:52:56	andyfingerhut	OK, I understand the behavior now.  Check doc string for clojure.string/replace.  When the thing to be matched is a regex, then the replacement string has special treatment for backslashes.

2013-09-08 23:41:45	akurilin	What is the deal with having two vars with the same name, one with a * after it? As in, my-function and my-function*. Is this a common pattern for defining a macro and a function it calls internally?

2013-09-08 23:42:23	bbloom	akurilin: some of us feel that the * naming is a bit of an anachronism though

2013-09-08 23:42:40	bbloom	akurilin: i prefer a -fn suffix for the functions that back my macros
2013-09-08 23:42:41	seangrov`	callen: Definitely could be. I also trigger some bad compilations on every-other compile when using auto. But now I know enough that I can talk a bit with dnolen and possibly track down the issue myself
2013-09-08 23:42:50	bbloom	akurilin: a * suffix basically is an admission that i couldn't come up with a better name

2013-09-08 23:43:36	seancorfield	akurilin: i also do that with an internal implementation for an interface, such as when instrumenting code for New Relic
2013-09-08 23:43:38	seangrov`	seancorfield: Yeah, there aren't many reasons left not to do most development in cljs at this point
2013-09-08 23:43:41	callen	note that the syntax was sufficiently clear that akurilin guessed what was going on.
2013-09-08 23:43:51	seangrov`	Getting started is still rough, but I'm not clean on how to fix that quite yet
2013-09-08 23:44:29	callen	getting started meaning getting lein-cljsbuild to work, or understanding how to organize things?
2013-09-08 23:44:59	seangrov`	callen: More like time-to-repl-working
2013-09-08 23:45:01	akurilin	callen, I was using clojure.jdbc's db-transaction as example, and it's pretty obvious from that example since the former is a two-liner, and the latter is a giant blob of logic.
2013-09-08 23:45:20	seangrov`	You need a host html page setup, etc.
2013-09-08 23:45:29	callen	seangrov`: have you tried Austin?
2013-09-08 23:45:39	seangrov`	Not yet, looking forward to it though
2013-09-08 23:45:40	callen	I've seen some new people gravitate towards that.
2013-09-08 23:46:07	bbloom	callen: the problem is that * is used in lots of places besides just macro/function divide
2013-09-08 23:46:11	akurilin	bbloom, that's fair, I'll keep it in mind
2013-09-08 23:46:46	akurilin	bbloom, that's also true. Whenever I see * my gut reaction is "this is some magical part of Clojure I haven't used yet likely"
2013-09-08 23:46:59	bbloom	akurilin: heh, but it's also on list*
2013-09-08 23:47:09	bbloom	akurilin: it literally means "like that thing without the star, only a little different"
2013-09-08 23:47:23	callen	* is an indication that you're looking at an underlying primitive of some sort.
2013-09-08 23:47:28	dissipate_	if i were to implement the public suffix algorithm in clojure, would that be worthy of clojars? http://publicsuffix.org/list/
2013-09-08 23:47:33	callen	I don't think it's really that unclear, but that might be the CL brain damage talking.
2013-09-08 23:47:44	akurilin	is *foo* a convention for per-thread bindings?
2013-09-08 23:47:45	bbloom	callen: does list* underly list?
2013-09-08 23:47:46	callen	dissipate_: you can deploy whatever you want to clojars.
2013-09-08 23:47:48	bbloom	akurilin: yes

2013-09-08 23:48:15	akurilin	Ok the next person to overload * with some other meaning gets the hat of shame.
2013-09-08 23:48:25	dissipate_	callen, would this be useful?
2013-09-08 23:48:27	callen	I think having universal warning signals like * and ! are useful and I don't find the patterns unclear.
2013-09-08 23:48:47	bbloom	callen: * is useful, but it's also vague
2013-09-08 23:49:06	callen	by the time you need to care, you already know what it means.
2013-09-08 23:49:18	akurilin	bbloom, that latter scenario you listed does sound a bit silly, although I do struggle every time with finding good meaningful function names that fit under 10 characters.
2013-09-08 23:49:25	callen	it's not like monads in Haskell where you're forced to care but nothing makes sense.
2013-09-08 23:49:26	akurilin	It's really challenging.

2013-09-08 23:52:51	lgs32a	that is all well-tested
2013-09-08 23:53:02	lgs32a	it must be directly in the function where the ref is used
2013-09-08 23:53:08	callen	lgs32a: that reduces the surface area you need for check for a keyword being Seq'd over.
2013-09-08 23:53:12	dnolen	seangrov`: note the improvements only apply if you use :optimizations :none, we can't make Closure any faster.

2013-09-08 23:53:36	lgs32a	it would be too nice if the concurrent exception would print the stack-trace
2013-09-08 23:53:37	bbloom	what's the preferred representation for 3x3 affline transformation matrixes these days?

2013-09-08 23:53:41	bbloom	(in clojure, i mean)
2013-09-08 23:53:45	lgs32a	can i print the stack-trace of the second last exception?
2013-09-08 23:53:51	lgs32a	somehow?

2013-09-09 01:11:55	justin_smith	or could an error in my project.clj deps be silently failing?

2013-09-09 01:42:30	shaungilchrist	after much rumination I think I have decided the reason clojure/scirpt makes me so happy is that it keeps you out of "the loathe zone" e.g. where regardless of best practice you are just not happy with the resulting codebase. With clojure there is always a way to make it better/cleaner/more abstracted in a good way.  that is all.

2013-09-09 02:28:35	lynaghk	It sounds like the original design (just emit stuff and let Google's compiler clean up and optimize) has evolved into CLJS itself doing more and more compiler-y optimization things

2013-09-09 04:23:22	justin_smith	on a much smaller / less real world scale, a clojure version of core wars, where everyone gets their own thread / repl in the same vm could be interesting - I assume certain operations that manipulate threads would need to be nerfed out though

2013-09-09 04:55:22	OneFourSeven	Hey guys. I was wondering if it's possible to expose another library's functions in my library. Like if I wanted to build a monolithic framework and wanted to expose Hiccup for templating.
2013-09-09 04:55:42	arrdem	OneFourSeven: is it possible, yes. should you do it? no.

2013-09-09 09:25:53	ddellacosta	ah, I see
2013-09-09 09:26:06	SegFaultAX	I mean to say that's what docker uses.

2013-09-09 09:26:22	SegFaultAX	Anyway, it provides really excellent filesystem-level isolation.
2013-09-09 09:27:31	SegFaultAX	ddellacosta: The idea I have in my head that just seems so sexy is being able to have my build server turn my application into a docker image which it then pushes up to a private repo. Then I just signal all my servers to pull down the latest image.
2013-09-09 09:27:54	ddellacosta	SegFaultAX: that is *so* exactly the kind of thing I was thinking

2013-09-09 09:31:12	SegFaultAX	That's not to say docker won't have its shortcomings (java certainly does) but it allows us to build and deploy our applications at a higher level of abstraction.

2013-09-09 13:11:22	clgv	TEttinger: do you really need that global value? if so for some kind of registry you can use an atom or ref as its value
2013-09-09 13:11:54	hyPiRion	Pass it as a value.
2013-09-09 13:12:01	TEttinger	it is only so other functions can have access to a worldmap once it's generated

2013-09-09 13:13:54	hyPiRion	yeah
2013-09-09 13:14:04	hyPiRion	TEttinger: In case it turns into a bit of an overhead to pass around, put dynamic vars into their own namespace, and on initialization do (binding [*width* w] (run-game-here))

2013-09-09 20:40:39	tbaldridge	rhg135: a lot of clojure assumes a highly optimized compiler (JIT) and a super fast GC. HotSpot will regularly recompile portions of your code as it runs. Doing that with LLVM is super hard. Also, LLVM's GC support is pretty poor.

2013-09-09 20:42:29	coventry`	I've cloned core.clj into a separate namespace, and I want to run the clojure test suite using it.  Is there a way to bind clojure/core in the namespace infrastructure to my new namespace?  If not, I can just eval the tests in the context of the new ns, but a safe way of doing that kind of rebinding would be pretty cool.
2013-09-09 20:42:52	ToxicFrog	I mean, yes, if you're operating at google scale things are different, a 2% increase in resource usage can mean you mean dozens or hundreds of additional machines - but for most things, optimizing for shorter development time and fewer bugs will be better for both you and for the user than optimizing away a few tens of milliseconds of startup time or a few megabytes of memory usage.

2013-09-09 23:58:34	clj_newb_2345	no, I'm using clojure on the backend
2013-09-09 23:58:35	SegFaultAX	Then again, I we use marionette which is a whole new level of brain damage.
2013-09-09 23:58:41	clj_newb_2345	probably either monger, redis, or datomic
2013-09-09 23:58:50	clj_newb_2345	backbone.marionette?
2013-09-09 23:58:54	SegFaultAX	clj_newb_2345: Yes.

2013-09-09 23:59:24	SegFaultAX	clj_newb_2345: Backbone by itself is pointless.
2013-09-09 23:59:28	Raynes	noprompt: https://github.com/Raynes/fs/issues/47 This is a big deal. The API needs to be audited to make sure all the functions are consistent in argument ordering and what they return (everything should return a File object and not a string unless it absolutely does not make sense, because you don't want to chain functions and make a new File object every time and then convert it to a string every time, that's silly).
2013-09-09 23:59:45	SegFaultAX	clj_newb_2345: It doesn't provide nearly enough functionality to justify using it alone.
2013-09-09 23:59:55	Raynes	noprompt: The more complicated issue and the one I've been lazy about is https://github.com/Raynes/fs/issues/38

2013-09-10 07:51:54	andyfingerhut	I hope I'm not simply muddying the water by giving a similar example like (for [x ["foo" #{1 2 3} [3.5 2.8]]] (count x))
2013-09-10 07:52:37	andyfingerhut	Each time through the for, x is bound to a different value.  In my example, each of those values has a different type.  So the name x names a value with a different type in different iterations.  Each of those values is immutable, though.

2013-09-10 09:20:34	Ember-	I created a SPA framework back when SPA was pretty much unheard of which gave our product a competetive edge

2013-09-10 11:44:07	ambrosebs	You should be hitting this funciton type of reduce: [[a c -> a] a (Option (Seqable c)) -> a]
2013-09-10 11:44:28	ambrosebs	that's the most general one.
2013-09-10 11:44:40	ambrosebs	it doesn't expect a non-empty seqable.
2013-09-10 11:44:58	ambrosebs	So I suspect the error is somewhere else in the call to reduce.

2013-09-10 11:45:56	kaw	Hmm
2013-09-10 11:46:21	kaw	Well, can't remember the details now, but it was the two-argument reduce, not the three-argument one (was mistaken saying it was the third arg, sorry)
2013-09-10 11:46:29	ambrosebs	ah ok.
2013-09-10 11:46:30	kaw	Not sure if that would influence anything
2013-09-10 11:46:49	kaw	But my core problem was that map didn't seem to preserve nonemptiness
2013-09-10 11:47:12	kaw	My code would have broken if the sequence was empty, but I could guarantee that it wasn't empty
2013-09-10 11:47:54	ambrosebs	a quick way to cast to nonempty is (let [s (map ...) _ (assert (seq s))] (reduce ... s))
2013-09-10 11:48:14	ambrosebs	map isn't accurate enough yet to figure that out.

2013-09-10 11:55:27	ambrosebs	that wouldn't need hard coding.

2013-09-10 16:55:50	tbaldridge	sm0ke: actors couple concurrency, state management, and processes all together in a single "thing" that can't be decoupled. In core.async, we have queues for concurrency, go blocks for processes, and atoms/refs for state management.

2013-09-10 16:57:52	tbaldridge	sm0ke: Clojure provides primitives for allowing safe mutating of shared references, but yes, in general we should avoid state, but no matter what you do, you'll always have "mutable state".

2013-09-10 16:58:29	mdrogalis	I'd get a kick if you guys renamed core.async to "actresses".
2013-09-10 16:58:51	sm0ke	ok one more thing? actors libraries if propery designed run several thousand actors on a sigle thread? how is this in clojure core.async?

2013-09-10 17:00:18	sm0ke	is go blocks something similar to golang channels? sorry i am very new to the scene!
2013-09-10 17:00:31	tbaldridge	sm0ke: we can do that as well, go processes can be as light as a few hundred bytes (or less). And they do not map 1:1 to threads.

2013-09-10 17:01:02	tbaldridge	sm0ke: yes, core.async is basically a implementation of many of Go's channel features on Clojure (and the JVM).

2013-09-10 17:09:09	tbaldridge	mdrogalis: it really depends on the task, pmap will convert a vector to a seq. Reducers will keep it as a vector, and since the structure of vectors is basically a tree, reducers will allocate a thread to each branch.

2013-09-11 07:12:56	bbloom	it's impossible to have a doubly linked list that is also fully persistent w/ structural sharing. not that that means there is never a use for a double linked list, but it's highly unlikely you need that compared to a persistent structure

2013-09-11 11:53:12	fredyr	but i think the key here is that the lambda gets interpreted with (interp code (ext-env parms args env))
2013-09-11 11:53:45	sdegutis	fredyr: i think your solution might work on account of it being mutable.

2013-09-11 13:26:59	sm0ke	sounds boring but..i bet there must be some standard way to write clojure  system
2013-09-11 13:27:29	TEttinger	sm0ke, yeah think of it kinda like C, you have a main function (the top-level, and also -main in some cases) and everything gets called in order.
2013-09-11 13:28:22	sm0ke	i was thinking exactly the same thing...but feared you guys will kick my ass if i say do i think like programming in C :P

2013-09-11 13:28:42	mathiasp	I'm puzzled: I wrote a small script to convert a simple csv to an html file, using enlive, running in immutant. The test.csv and the template are UTF-8, I have set JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS=-Dfile.encoding=UTF8, and <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />  in the template, and still I get iso-8859-1 in the output. Maybe even something else, recode complains when trying to convert the result to utf-8. Any ideas how I
2013-09-11 13:28:43	mathiasp	can find out where this happens? It happens in the template and in the csv content. I'm stumped.

2013-09-11 13:39:47	TEttinger	sm0ke, part that was hard for me learning clojure was the concurrency primitive stuff.  coming from java, my instinct was to make every possibly mutable thing a ref, but it is generally better to just use clojure's immutable persistence and return/use new values (good performance on this too).

2013-09-11 13:43:47	TEttinger	a ref is a reference, it can only be modified in a dosync block IIRC
2013-09-11 13:43:54	TEttinger	but
2013-09-11 13:44:01	TEttinger	it can be read outside of it at any time
2013-09-11 13:44:31	TEttinger	so you can have a ref being updated by multiple threads, each one waits for dosync to finish before starting its own modifications

2013-09-11 14:25:56	dcunit3d	but the last test for this question requires that you distinguish each empty sequence type (http://www.4clojure.com/problem/65#prob-title)

2013-09-11 17:44:17	jml	ok. first up: edn strings can span multiple lines, and also can contain escape characters '\n'. *But* the equality section says that strings are equal to strings with the same edn representation
2013-09-11 17:44:38	jml	which means that "foo\nbar" is not equal to "foo
2013-09-11 17:44:39	jml	bar"
2013-09-11 17:44:41	opqdonut	you should either do (fn [arg] (cond (instance? Boolean arg) arg (instance? String arg) arg))

2013-09-11 19:34:14	bbloom	alandipert: conversion to SSA would be a pass & then there are *many* SSA optimization you (or LLVM or whatever) could perform. then you'd have an SSA->target code generation pass
2013-09-11 19:34:40	bbloom	alandipert: let me be clear: smaller simpler passes are a very good thing that will make the compiler better in many many ways

2013-09-11 19:35:28	bbloom	alandipert: however in terms of time-to-CinC, i don't think it will make anything faster or dramatically easier, since the problems are practically unrelated to the complexity of the *code generator* which is the (currently) final and most platform specific pass
2013-09-11 19:36:07	bbloom	alandipert: there are lots of little optimizations that we can do that will make our lives easier for code generation
2013-09-11 19:36:33	bbloom	alandipert: for example, we talked about ANF transform which will mean we don't need to do those (function() { })() scope thinggies in JS. similar simplifications would be available for the JVM

2013-09-11 19:38:30	alandipert	bbloom: i guess i feel differently re: CinC, as i see conforming to target platform idioms/constraints as a kind of optimization, made easier when the compiler framework isn't allowed to make many assumptions about target

2013-09-13 22:34:00	amalloy	Bronsa: well, (a), this is at macroexpansion time, and (b), are you sure? reduce into is building multiple vectors, which could get a little expensive. i mean, you're probably right, but there's some real expense in both approaches
2013-09-13 22:34:43	Bronsa	amalloy: ~@ transforms to apply+vector+concat
2013-09-13 22:34:53	amalloy	indeed

2013-09-13 22:35:44	Bronsa	I'm just saying, maybe performances is why he wrote it that way
2013-09-13 22:36:06	janiczek	but it's a wonderful thought - probably around 90% of webhostings (at least here in Czech Republic) are PHP, majority of clients are going to pick cheap hosting instead of dedicated server or something - it would be great to Clojure on PHP.

2013-09-14 12:49:07	klokbaske	So, functional reactive programming vs csp (eg core.async). What's the difference?

2013-09-14 12:50:18	klokbaske	I've used the former a couple of times, and it seems to me that core.async's channels are much like signals in Frp

2013-09-14 13:01:21	pyrtsa	klokbaske: When you're using core.async, you explicitly `put!` values into a given channel. In FRP, less so.

2013-09-14 13:03:59	pyrtsa	In a function you write in CSP, you may have more than one channel you're sending values to, in FRP the explicit pieces of code -- RxJava example being: (.onNext observer value) -- are rarely explicitly written and almost always only push values into one single observer.
2013-09-14 13:04:03	klokbaske	pyrtsa: ok, i see what you mean with imperative then.
2013-09-14 13:04:43	pyrtsa	In FRP, you're mostly using stream combinators, i.e. your code contains zero onNext's, onError's or onCompleted's.

2013-09-15 05:45:52	tomjack	the problem is that you can't pass an(y) observable around and always get consistent answers out of it
2013-09-15 05:46:20	elifrey	tomjack: if your code is pure and without effects, it is referentially transpent (for some value of referential transparancy)
2013-09-15 05:46:44	tomjack	but Rx code is never pure
2013-09-15 05:48:09	elifrey	is it a situation that you might, say, map an impure function over an observable, or is the implementation of observables themselves break their denotation?
2013-09-15 05:48:10	tomjack	e.g., say I do a selectMany where the function passed always returns the same hot observable
2013-09-15 05:48:28	tomjack	the latter

2013-09-15 05:49:22	elifrey	what are hot/cold observables?
2013-09-15 05:50:13	tomjack	a cold observable is basically a relatively pure (fn subscribe [callback] ...)
2013-09-15 05:50:35	tomjack	like interval, which emits messages at fixed intervals
2013-09-15 05:50:49	tomjack	every time you subscribe it starts at the beginning

2013-09-15 06:36:32	tomjack	I found it interesting that the implementation in "LTL Types FRP" is async and that causal functions are modelled as processes

2013-09-15 06:40:45	tomjack	it looks like a causal function is (implemented as) either a function which takes an interval of input to a new causal function, or an interval of output with the next causal function, or it's done
2013-09-15 06:41:32	dissipate_	uvtc, i don't see what the threading thing buys you. it just looks like it reverses the order of things.
2013-09-15 06:41:38	tomjack	which sounds vaguely reminiscent of core.async's channels
2013-09-15 06:41:55	tomjack	but they are no help I think
2013-09-15 06:42:22	elifrey	does causal function mean Behavior?
2013-09-15 06:42:48	elifrey	is an interval an interval of time?

2013-09-15 07:05:41	s4muel	uvtc: I think the former just kicks off the generic 'inferior lisp', but I'm not sure.

2013-09-15 07:06:02	s4muel	uvtc: in terms of integration with clojure, 99% of the time, you want nrepl-jack-in

2013-09-15 07:10:01	uvtc	<https://github.com/clojure/tools.nrepl/> indicates that nREPL (aka tools.nrepl) provides both a server *and* a client. But it seems to me that, when integrating with Emacs, nrepl.el is the client (and so whatever client nREPL provides goes unused). Does that sound about right?

2013-09-15 11:51:59	ambrosebs	squidz: so CLJS support is basically a bunch of macros in the cljs.core.typed namespace. You should replace (:require [clojure.core.typed :as t]) with (:require-macros [cljs.core.typed :as t]) and most of the type system semantics are identical.

2013-09-15 11:52:27	ambrosebs	squidz: then run the Clojure macro (cljs.core.typed/check-ns 'my-ns) in a Clojure REPL to check a CLJS namespace.
2013-09-15 11:52:58	squidz	okay and that works for all of the javascript interop types too?
2013-09-15 11:53:30	ambrosebs	squidz: the types are slightly different.
2013-09-15 11:54:19	ambrosebs	squidz: eg. there are string and number primitive types. Also things like Seqable are slightly different. clojure.lang.Seqable vs cljs.core/ISeqable.
2013-09-15 11:54:56	ambrosebs	squidz: I intend to include more type aliases to save rewriting the types for CLJ/CLJS.

But in a "lein run" the main just ends without the callback completing?

2013-09-16 03:29:13	benkay	the suggested solution is to add a simple class to the jar, but as I'm using the SWIG compiled java wrapper, I just wrote that wrapper as a file in the same directory (I have zero experience with Java development - trying to hack my way to competence over here), but then I run into another UnsatisfiedLinkError, no QuantLibJNI in java.library.path.
2013-09-16 03:29:32	benkay	question is: is there a subtlety to adding in new java classes to a set of files vs. a jar?

2013-09-16 05:18:42	grandy	new to clojure, trying to figure out if there is a simple way to convert the nested vector output of instaparse into a map or something along those lines
2013-09-16 05:19:53	benkay	(musing aloud in hopes that someone corrects me), according to (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10558795/using-lwjgl-in-leiningen-clojure), apparently I could reference `native/linux` (or in my case, native/osx). so i'm going to copy the dylibs in my homebrew folder to native/osx and point Leiningen at them.
2013-09-16 05:20:02	callen	grandy: you want a nested map instead of a nested vector?

2013-09-16 05:22:12	callen	grandy: if you want something flat, then you need to learn to use zippers more than likely.
2013-09-16 05:22:50	grandy	callen: ahh ok, i guess maybe i can destructure the nested vector
2013-09-16 05:23:22	callen	but parsers are naturally a nested "thing"

2013-09-16 05:23:41	callen	whether your data structured is zipped or not, the data *will* be nested fundamentally.

2013-09-17 00:31:22	appendonly	one 'soft' attribute i'm finding hard with clojure is that the top-level namespace has many tokens. i'm having trouble holding the whole thing in my head, like i would with c or scheme. in the lisp world, i know common lisp also has many top-level tokens in the standard language, often with hungarian notation. are there any clojure-specific tools for vim that would help me here?

"(ns a-b.c) (definterface d) (fn [^a_b.c.d am] 1)", not "^a-b.c.d".  (Which gives the same exception as (in-ns a-b.c), which is why I was stumped by that silly question.  Argh.)

2013-09-17 08:17:05	clojurebot	flatten is rarely the right answer. Suppose you need to use a list as your "base type", for example. Usually you only want to flatten a single level, and in that case you're better off with concat. Or, better still, use mapcat to produce a sequence that's shaped right to begin with.
