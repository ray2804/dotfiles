2013-05-23 22:59:03	supersym	I tried a whole lot of different ways, changing the path etc. Rendering somewhere seems to be the missing link but I find no references to that being a requirement
2013-05-23 23:17:17	supersym	"When the base.html is rendered it will replace the register and home blocks with the ones from these templates." I took the same steps and confirm no result.
