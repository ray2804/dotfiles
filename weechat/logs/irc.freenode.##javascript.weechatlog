2013-08-30 22:41:26	dwcook	guideX, not sure what this has to do with being able to use asynchronous functions or not.
2013-08-30 22:41:41	dwcook	Ideally, your server-side structure shouldn't affect that.
2013-08-30 22:41:59	guideX	well in this case, i cannot use an async function, because they simply are not compatible with the updatepanel..
2013-08-30 22:42:14	dwcook	That's a little hard to believe.
2013-08-30 22:42:28	dwcook	Is it that the function expects an immediate result for something?

2013-08-30 22:43:09	guideX	well basically, there's a bunch of objects created at the end of the update panels stuff, and I need to use a jquery library when they're created
2013-08-30 22:43:26	dwcook	Much of the jQuery API is asynchronous.

2013-08-30 22:43:35	guideX	an update panel is basically an asp.net tag , everything between the tag is partial postbacks

2013-08-30 22:48:15	guideX	it's more why doesn't settimeout block the do loop
2013-08-30 22:48:22	guideX	or how do I block the do loop?
2013-08-30 22:48:35	Sorella	guideX, what are you trying to do? Forget all about the "I can't use asynchronous" part, just say what you want to do with the contents of the updatepanel
2013-08-30 22:48:36	yeboot	make it a while loop?
2013-08-30 22:49:13	guideX	oh I'm trying to find all of .shippingOptions .shippingOption tags, and do something with them
2013-08-30 22:49:17	dwcook	guideX, it's because calling setTimeout only means to throw the function in a queue of things that will be executed later. They can't start executing as long as something else is already on the stack though.
2013-08-30 22:49:39	dwcook	guideX, you don't block the do loop. You factor it out into recursion within the timeouts.

2013-08-30 22:57:58	dwcook	guideX, if you think it looks terrible, you could abstract it out into a higher-order function that looks less terrible when you call it.

2013-08-30 22:58:23	dwcook	For that matter, a promises library could make this pretty, I believe.

2013-08-31 07:50:57	Maxdamantus	So they get to refer to jQuery with $ and get to declare all their variables without infecting the global object.

2013-09-02 02:00:03	Sorella	ezakimak, optimisation is tricky at the library level, specially dealing with GC. In a language like Elm, you can optimise on the static guarantees.
2013-09-02 02:00:24	ezakimak	would be great for data visualization though
2013-09-02 02:00:34	Sorella	Microsoft implements such concept with Observables, which kind of gives you this property, but has lots of drawbacks.

2013-09-02 02:38:49	Sorella	substack, FRP is actually pretty simple. You have a signal that captures discrete or continuous values over time. And you create new signals by transforming old signals. Events are signals, so you can abstract over them and compose them. By the end of the day, you have cleanly separated your stuff and has something that is big, yet not complected :)
2013-09-02 02:38:50	garbagecollectio	basically you are just splitting the input in half and doing the binary search on a smaller input in two threads simultaneously

2013-09-02 03:46:48	Sorella	yogurt_truck, because you want foo(a); to choose the correct implementation of `foo` depending on `a`.

2013-09-02 03:46:59	MJCD	what does 'pure' even mean?
2013-09-02 03:47:01	sykopomp	I'm pretty sure you have no idea how something like var foo = function() {}, or how method definitions in "regular" javascript work if you think they're "pure" somehow.

2013-09-02 03:47:50	Sorella	yogurt_truck, you could make addMethod() return a new genFun with a new branch, but that wouldn't help previous usage of the genfun, which would totally miss the point of this.

2013-09-02 03:48:20	yogurt_truck	MJCD: pure is a function that maps from a domain to a codomain. sykopomp is just pretending i'm saying "wild shit", but he's just defending his design choice, which is ok.

2013-09-02 04:13:49	Sorella	sykopomp, there might be no "more specific" method though. In Clojure it actually makes sense because all functions have the same specificity, but that's a "problem" with predicate dispatch

2013-09-02 05:08:07	Sorella	sykopomp, theoretically, the premises of a function are functions from A → Bool. The first branch whose all premises return True for all inputs win, and is invoked. You can have optimisations in certain cases, but if you allow the predicate to be just about any function, then it's almost impossible to optimise.

2013-09-02 05:16:43	Sorella	But with full predicate dispatching, you have no idea of how you "weight" cases. For example, if I define: `(def-method add [is-number? is-number?] (a b) (+ a b))` and `(def-method add [is-int? is-int?] (a b) (+ a b))`, and call `(add 1 2)`, which method should be "more specific"?
2013-09-02 05:17:25	Sorella	If you have a Number class and an Int class, you can extract the hierarchy and use that to define the specificity, but in this case you don't have such hierarchy
2013-09-02 05:18:52	sykopomp	Sorella: you can implement genfun's dispatch over polygamous, though.

2013-09-02 05:19:56	Sorella	sykopomp, well, your dispatch function would need to know about the cases defined for a particular multimethod.
2013-09-02 05:20:24	sykopomp	Sorella: yeah basically.
2013-09-02 05:20:41	sykopomp	Sorella: but in the case of genfun, you'd need the genfun to do that work anyway, so it's kinda irrelevant.
2013-09-02 05:20:42	Sorella	Most of my multi-methods are basically function (a) { return someTagFor(a) }
2013-09-02 05:20:52	sykopomp	methods aren't stored inside the genfun. The genfun actually can't give you a list of all methods defined.

2013-09-02 08:20:08	Shirakawasuna	lite_: too vague to know for sure, but like I said... you use IDs as IDs. Not classes or groups.
2013-09-02 08:20:26	Agamemnus	all this blurring between the DOM and pure Javascript is bad

2013-09-02 08:22:31	Agamemnus	that's the downfall of IDs

2013-09-02 08:23:21	Agamemnus	i guess it's the same reason why using too many globals is bad
2013-09-02 08:23:27	yogurt_truck	lite_: it is not inherently wrong to use IDs. if they really express that the element is unique, and you want to also, say, be able to link to the element with URL fragments, go ahead
2013-09-02 08:23:41	Agamemnus	...especially if you are making a plugin
2013-09-02 08:23:45	sykopomp	on a side note about IDs
2013-09-02 08:23:57	sykopomp	I'm really excited that web components will actually give me a reason to use them a lot.
2013-09-02 08:24:07	Agamemnus	hmm
2013-09-02 08:24:11	Agamemnus	what do you mean?
2013-09-02 08:24:14	sykopomp	custom elements scope their templates' ids to the template itself.
2013-09-02 08:24:30	sykopomp	so if you have <div id=mything> inside your template, that doesn't escape outside of its scope.
2013-09-02 08:24:37	lite_	the only thing this id will be used for is to allow jbehave to select the element. (eg. selenium.click("css=#labelinput") )
2013-09-02 08:24:37	Agamemnus	isn't that just kind of like a class then?
2013-09-02 08:24:54	sykopomp	but your internal javascript (and CSS) for the template can see the id.
2013-09-02 08:25:01	--	psgs is now known as psgs|Work
2013-09-02 08:25:12	sykopomp	Agamemnus: they're still unique, within the template.
2013-09-02 08:25:18	yogurt_truck	an ID is never anything like a class, (except the "class" that has only one member)
2013-09-02 08:25:20	sykopomp	and you can do getElementById on them.
2013-09-02 08:25:48	sykopomp	I assume you get the speed benefits from them, too, not just the expressive benefits.
2013-09-02 08:26:03	sykopomp	and actually there's another really nice thing about it.
2013-09-02 08:26:07	yogurt_truck	that too
2013-09-02 08:26:22	sykopomp	you don't have to struggle between wrapping your inputs in <label>
2013-09-02 08:26:35	sykopomp	you can actually use IDs with your form fields, and <label for=...>
2013-09-02 08:26:42	sykopomp	and you don't have to worry about scoping issues.
2013-09-02 08:26:52	sykopomp	this is probably the part I'm most excited about.

2013-09-02 08:55:17	yogurt_truck	they're all modules. but yeah. some core graphic modules get automatically imported
2013-09-02 08:55:19	sykopomp	yes, but you need Elm programmers to change how something looks :\

2013-09-02 08:56:25	sykopomp	I think there's a line when it comes to things like stylus/haml/etc (not that I like haml that much), but they're really just syntactic/convenience abstractions over the core html/css, so html/css people can still handle it.
2013-09-02 08:56:51	yogurt_truck	sykopomp: that's only bad for familiarity reasons. because you can definitely (like i'm doing with my shmup game atm) have a totally separate display file with only display-specific definitions (colors, gradients, sizes, positions. all of which are in addition, obviously, waaay easier and more terse to do in Elm than in stupid CSS)
2013-09-02 08:57:00	yogurt_truck	bu tyeah

Can anyone help me understanding this code? http://pastebin.com/gf206Cp0. for once, I dont understand what the BigInteger does. i dont find any js file where its defined. But neither can i find a known standard BigInteger() function via googe. does it limit the integer value to 16 chars? or is it a hex/ base 16 thing?

2013-09-07 07:35:07	Agamemnus	i am not sure if overflow hidden does anything
2013-09-07 07:35:43	Agamemnus	i guess the problem is that they aren't self-contained
2013-09-07 07:35:49	Agamemnus	but that class doesn't have a transition
2013-09-07 07:36:02	nowlan	so it's a 3s transition to opacity:1
2013-09-07 07:36:06	Agamemnus	an object can only have one transition
2013-09-07 07:36:21	Agamemnus	i guess it is a flaw in the design

2013-09-07 07:44:03	gizmore	so you act on specific items, not some global

2013-09-07 14:30:06	jarek	what is the best way to test for IE6/7/8/9/10/11? What window.* object is present in all those browsers (but not in other browsers)?

2013-09-07 15:37:36	dev11	if web server gets a lot of ajax requests from a lot of clients - 2/3 per second per client will this slow down the server a lot of the server only sends few numbers as data to clients? and which will be better alternative than ajax for this?

2013-09-07 15:38:20	Gluesticky	How do you stop ajax requests from getting cached? Set headers?

2013-09-07 15:39:20	Gluesticky	ok
2013-09-07 15:39:44	icio	Gluesticky: alternatively, have the server set no-cache headers
2013-09-07 15:40:01	Gluesticky	Yeah that is what I do currently.
2013-09-07 15:40:33	icio	dev11: ajax might be enough, but there will be a limit. If you're wanting to send updates to the client you could look at websockets (and perhaps the Pusher service)
2013-09-07 15:41:08	dev11	icio, comet also is used for this?
2013-09-07 15:41:25	icio	Yes you'd be able to acheive what you're after with it
2013-09-07 15:41:32	icio	If that happens to be sending changes of the file
2013-09-07 15:41:38	dev11	icio, about the performance which will be best for this job? ajax/websockets/comet.. or?

2013-09-07 18:47:36	Deide	I hardly ever find a need for a full blown modal box that you can move around, so I've just taken to having an "overlay" element that basically occupies the entire screen, styled with about 0.9 alpha. Then you can just put all your modal stuff in there and display it when you need to, having a click handler in the overlay that closes it. Much more compatible with mobile.

2013-09-07 21:03:57	dwcook	Vetaxili, that is not a complete test case. But some assumption you're making about the flow of your code is wrong.
2013-09-07 21:04:07	msafi	dwcook, I'm specifically looking for a better way to handle "if (x !== y && z !== y)", especially that my x, y, and z are pretty long...
2013-09-07 21:04:48	dwcook	msafi, you could write a function to make it clearer.
2013-09-07 21:04:51	j201_	msafi: [x, z].indexOf(y) === -1
2013-09-07 21:04:57	j201_	or write a helper function
2013-09-07 21:05:25	j201_	but i think that's pretty readable in that case, although i can see how it could get out of hand

2013-09-08 02:40:49	Sorella	fordcars, no, that defines a function and returns its reference, then this reference is stored in the window.onload property.
2013-09-08 02:41:03	Sorella	fordcars, have you ever worked with a language with first-class functions?
2013-09-08 02:41:12	fordcars	Hehe
2013-09-08 02:41:18	Sorella	Python, for example
2013-09-08 02:41:25	fordcars	I sincerly have no idea
2013-09-08 02:42:20	Sorella	fordcars, hm, okay. So, you usually have objects, like numbers, strings, arrays, etc. And you can store these in variables, or pass them as arguments to functions. In JS, besides those types, functions are also values, so you can store them in variables, pass them around, return them from functions, etc.
2013-09-08 02:42:45	fordcars	Yes
2013-09-08 02:42:57	Sorella	fordcars, this means that when you do: `function() { ... }` you're creating an object, and you get back a reference to that object. Similarly when you do `1` you're creating a number object, and get a reference back.

2013-09-08 02:43:57	Sorella	fordcars, so in that example the `window.onload = ...` causes what is on the right hand side to be stored in the window.onload property. On the right here we have a function, so we get a function object stored in that property.

2013-09-08 02:44:59	Sorella	fordcars, you can call that function yourself later by using the `()` operator. The `()` operator after an expression means "call this value as a function". So `function(){ ... } ()` means call this function I've just defined. `window.onload()` means call the function inside window.onload.
2013-09-08 02:45:45	Sorella	fordcars, window is an object (the global object in browsers), `onload` is just a regular object property. The browser will call a function stored in the `window.onload` property when all the contents in the page finish downloading.

2013-09-08 02:46:13	fordcars	reallly?

2013-09-08 05:43:17	Sorella	pensmit, there are no class primtives in JS, because the OO model is prototypical rather than classical. However, some view constructor functions as something akin to classes, for some loose definitions of "class" — a blueprint by which other objects are made of. Most people also use such things with the purpose of classifying data rather than providing reusable behaviour.
2013-09-08 05:43:28	Sorella	pensmit, at the end of the day, it's all philosophical bullshit.

2013-09-08 11:36:46	austincheney	it would be nice to write a language parser in assembly so that it executes fast and then I can write my own language that is itself faster
2013-09-08 11:37:10	austincheney	awesome
2013-09-08 11:37:20	OneBraveHog	I used to get into 'assembly' vs c vs c++ on efnet and other places a LONG time ago - I do give credit to compilers - gcc even - to outperform.
2013-09-08 11:37:27	austincheney	i will be back.  i am starving, i need to grab some lunch
2013-09-08 11:37:29	OneBraveHog	BUT just sayin' it was a BLAST to be low level.

2013-09-08 11:47:01	Eppiox	Anyone use the devtools in chrome? The option to edit js on the fly vanished for me, where the options panel used to be is just white space for code... anyone know a fix?
2013-09-08 11:47:35	Maxdamantus	++ is funny in PHP.
2013-09-08 11:47:54	Maxdamantus	$a = "a"; $a += 1; /* $a == 1 */
2013-09-08 11:48:01	Maxdamantus	$a = "a"; $a++; /* $a == "b" */
2013-09-08 11:48:21	hans_henrik	seriouslly?
2013-09-08 11:48:56	hans_henrik	also IIRC, you can do like for($i='a';$i<'Z';++$i){echo $i;}
2013-09-08 11:48:58	Maxdamantus	Yes. "a" + 1 == 1
2013-09-08 11:49:11	hans_henrik	it will give you like abcdefghjk~
2013-09-08 11:49:30	Maxdamantus	http://hackage.haskell.org/package/acme-php gives you that functionality in Haskell too.
2013-09-08 11:49:59	Maxdamantus	Well, "a" + "1" == "1" with that.
2013-09-08 11:50:31	hans_henrik	hmm, that didnt work, but this works  for($i='a';$i<'z';$i++){echo $i;}
2013-09-08 11:50:46	Maxdamantus	Yeah, 'a' > 'Z'

2013-09-08 17:04:50	beaky	wow js sounds powerful and simple

2013-09-08 17:06:04	Sorella	But the languages kind of share similar goals.
2013-09-08 17:06:06	Unit158	It is simple, not nearly as powerful as python, or lua.
2013-09-08 17:06:16	doug65536	Sorella: lua is more complicated than js

2013-09-08 17:07:29	Unit158	metamethods?
2013-09-08 17:07:43	Sorella	Unit158, yeah, metamethods are sometimes called "magic" functions.

2013-09-08 17:08:45	Sorella	doug65536, not in ES5, but you can do in ES6 with proxies.
2013-09-08 17:08:49	doug65536	I mean widely supported
2013-09-08 17:09:06	Unit158	JS seems to be good for certain small applications. It seems when you get very big JS falls apart really quickly >_>
2013-09-08 17:09:10	Sorella	The only things Lua supports that JS doesn't are operator overloading and coroutines.
2013-09-08 17:09:17	Sorella	Oh, and maps, JS only has objects.
2013-09-08 17:09:37	Deide	ES6 will fix that too
2013-09-08 17:09:37	beaky	ruby is awfully complex
2013-09-08 17:09:41	Sorella	Unit158, not really. JS is well suited for large applications. (or rather, large applications are not suited for any language)

2013-09-09 02:01:30	sykopomp	jaxter: probably just for debugging. It's a global variable, most likely.
2013-09-09 02:01:43	nowlan	it is creating a global variable which name starts with "page" and then comes the id.
2013-09-09 02:02:04	sykopomp	you should be able to do page<id> in the console and see the handle returned by window.open
2013-09-09 02:02:06	nowlan	totally weird way to create a global variable. you could just write `window["page" + id] =`
2013-09-09 02:02:09	jaxter	thank you
2013-09-09 02:03:30	nowlan	now i see why people dislike eval.
2013-09-09 02:03:42	Jouva	So I'm a bit stuck. Been trying to find suggestions but I always end up in the wrong direction when I search for help on this. I'd like to make a simple card based game using objects. A deck object full of card objects, and a player which has a hand object and a discard pile object. But any time I look for "card games" it's always poker style "playing cards" and not generic cards.

2013-09-09 07:15:06	sykopomp	we already said anyone is not here
2013-09-09 07:15:09	sykopomp	stop addressing them
2013-09-09 07:15:14	Agamemnus	loading some html files via ajax... they have links that are relative to where they are loaded
2013-09-09 07:15:19	Agamemnus	ha, I like being difficult
2013-09-09 07:15:37	Agamemnus	now, i wonder if I should rewrite the links as I find them..?
2013-09-09 07:15:41	dodobrain	i would approach it carefully, perhaps with a stick in hand!
2013-09-09 07:15:46	Agamemnus	or should I use something else?
2013-09-09 07:15:50	Agamemnus	what should I do?
2013-09-09 07:16:05	Agamemnus	or use some crazy marker that lets me easily rewrite the links?
2013-09-09 07:16:21	ImBcmDth	like a special tag?
2013-09-09 07:16:36	Agamemnus	like, let's say I'm loading an html file that has pdf and img links
2013-09-09 07:16:36	dodobrain	Agamemnus, you want client side templating?
2013-09-09 07:16:49	Agamemnus	but those links are relative to that file

2013-09-09 07:20:52	sykopomp	you can just use that
2013-09-09 07:21:06	dodobrain	jquery has some templating plugins too
2013-09-09 07:21:08	dodobrain	iirc
2013-09-09 07:21:09	sykopomp	and really you probably want to use lodash anyway like all the cool kids.
2013-09-09 07:21:17	Agamemnus	nah nah, no need for templating

2013-09-09 08:08:37	MJCD	Given that so many people still use it it would be incorrect to ever call it 'useless'
2013-09-09 08:09:05	MJCD	... efficient essentially to people who are used to it already is how I would summarise it

2013-09-09 08:09:24	MJCD	the only real problem in my eyes is that oldschool dev's recommend vim and get people learning it
2013-09-09 08:09:28	MJCD	because its what you're used to
2013-09-09 08:09:37	MJCD	one would argue that if you wanted to really help move things forward
2013-09-09 08:09:43	sykopomp	it's not what I'm used to. I'm pretty new to vim-style editing.

2013-09-09 08:09:56	MJCD	the same as people once did with VIM to get it to where it is now
2013-09-09 08:09:59	sykopomp	I actually switched to it because I got so efficient with emacs bindings that I didn't have anywhere else to go.
2013-09-09 08:10:25	sykopomp	vim and emacs are both open source...

2013-09-09 08:11:00	sykopomp	why would I use sublime text?
2013-09-09 08:11:10	MJCD	Because it provides a gui.
2013-09-09 08:11:16	sykopomp	so do vim and emacs?
2013-09-09 08:11:19	sykopomp	but actually I want to ask
2013-09-09 08:11:29	sykopomp	why would I use a GUI? I actually turned off my GUI on emacs after a year or so.
2013-09-09 08:11:32	dodobrain	i think one of the reasons i use vim is because there is no gui
2013-09-09 08:11:34	sykopomp	because it's pointless and gets in the way.
2013-09-09 08:11:35	MJCD	lol forget it

2013-09-09 08:12:13	MJCD	because its far more efficient for say, doing arbitrary selections..
2013-09-09 08:12:35	dodobrain	yeah, a combination of rat and the keyboard is good
2013-09-09 08:12:37	MJCD	I think if your worried that you might stop typing for 1 second at a time
2013-09-09 08:12:38	sykopomp	maybe for people who don't know how to make arbitrary selections.
2013-09-09 08:12:43	MJCD	you probably have much bigger productivity problems

2013-09-09 08:13:00	sykopomp	there's two issues, of course.
2013-09-09 08:13:04	MJCD	so your argument is that people should just learn to do it in VIM?
2013-09-09 08:13:05	MJCD	fucksake
2013-09-09 08:13:08	MJCD	this argument is so fucking retarded
2013-09-09 08:13:10	sykopomp	the first one is "why are you selecting anything in the first place?"
2013-09-09 08:13:12	MJCD	im so fucking done with having it.
2013-09-09 08:13:22	sykopomp	the second question is "why do you think it's actually more efficient with the mouse?"

2013-09-09 13:36:57	RangerMauve	One sec
2013-09-09 13:37:02	MJCD	is that in this you're mistaken. The camera will never move in the game, but the sphere could grow

2013-09-09 13:40:15	MJCD	and generate the sphere around that
2013-09-09 13:40:20	MJCD	but its ok I can do it the other way
2013-09-09 13:40:21	RangerMauve	Yeah, if you set the position to 0,0,0 it'll always be centered
2013-09-09 13:40:33	RangerMauve	Then you can change the sphere's position

2013-09-09 13:42:53	RangerMauve	TT_TT
2013-09-09 13:43:15	RangerMauve	Other than that, if you apply an offset to the points, you can get the sphere's points anywhere
2013-09-09 13:43:43	RangerMauve	I'd suggest making a function to give you the offset rather than re-generating the entire buffer of vertecies
2013-09-09 13:44:01	RangerMauve	And the rotation of the sphere shouldn't matter since the radius is the same in all directions

2013-09-09 22:56:43	Lewix	why is that sometimes I cannot use what 'this' represent directly. For example, if I have image.onclick = function () { //...; some_other_image.setAttribute('src', this.getAttribute('href') } it works but If i replace this by 'image' itself it does not
2013-09-09 22:56:51	Sorella	bberry__, though people not using all features of C++ kind of makes that a little less bad. Maybe.

2013-09-09 22:58:19	Sorella	bberry__, it is said that when Bjarnestroup thought about C++ he had this in mind: "Oh, I know, I'll make a programming language so fucked up that no one *ever* will remotely think about using it.

However, since the error is the second argument, and if you leave it out there's no warning, it's all to easy to forget to handle them

2013-09-09 23:24:08	benny-	bradleymeck, this works, as long as stroke-width doesn't get defined by css file
2013-09-09 23:24:13	Sorella	MrNaviPacho, yes, you can efficiently share all your data between all threads without locks or any kind of synchronisation or serialisation/message passing. So all forms of parallelism are both thread-safe (no concurrent modifications) and blazing fast (shared memory).

2013-09-09 23:25:30	Sorella	MrNaviPacho, also, immutable values are much easier to test, debug and reason about, because you only depend on the value itself, rather than the operations the program has performed.

2013-09-09 23:27:27	Sorella	MrNaviPacho, you can't change the variable in place, but you can *transform* it (create a new value based on the data from the previous value). This can be particularly efficient with enforced immutability because the compiler is free to figure out how to share memory. Also it GCs can be more efficient.

2013-09-09 23:29:42	Sorella	Except that in JS the engines can't optimise this because they're not *guranteed* do be immutable. This is, in fact, a big problem they're trying to solve with WebWorkers now, because there's no non-overheady way of sharing values between the main thread and different webworkers for parallel computations.

2013-09-09 23:36:35	Sorella	aeoril, a design pattern is a convention for how a particular problem should be solved. However, design patterns rely on familiarity (people have done this before, they learnt how to do this, so they'll instantly recognise and we can move on), but you can't have familiarity for everyone, and they make things unnecessarily complex in most cases.

2013-09-09 23:37:04	Sorella	aeoril, the right way of attacking the problem is discovering what the problem is, and how you can simplify it and abstract over it. Such that when people first encounter it they just need to reason about the intent.

2013-09-09 23:48:03	Sorella	j201, the "programming with mathematical functions" definition is agreed upon, at least in the PLT community
2013-09-09 23:48:16	j201	tjbarber: can you show an example of what you're looking at?

2013-09-09 23:49:28	Sorella	aeoril, it's the component you use to abstract over a concept. Say you have a concept X, and you want to deal with it at a lower level. In an OOP language, you would use an object to achieve this higher-level of abstraction, in a functional language you'd use functions."
2013-09-09 23:49:35	j201	Sorella: but i don't think that meshes with what the common idea of fp is in the programming community

2013-09-09 23:50:19	Sorella	j201, no, most people outside of the PLT community use the second definition. Some people use the "anything with first-class functions" definition.
2013-09-09 23:50:19	aeoril	Oh "unit" right? lol
2013-09-09 23:50:28	Sorella	aeoril, oh, right, unit :)

2013-09-09 23:55:16	Sorella	aeoril, yes. The second definition uses the functions as the primary abstraction unit, but does not enforce purity. In this definition, functions are allowed to modify values, or have side-effects. A mathematical (pure) function can not have side-effects, it's only allowed to take inputs and return an output.

2013-09-09 23:57:14	Sorella	aeoril, you only have expressions, and functions abstract over expressions. In a functional language: `f(x) = x + 5; f(5)` and `5 + 5` are *always* the same thing.
2013-09-09 23:57:29	j201	aeoril: that means delaying evaluating expressions
2013-09-09 23:57:37	aeoril	j201 ok
2013-09-09 23:57:45	Sorella	So the model of computation in a functional language is done by means of substitutions. That's how you reason about it. However, you can't have this particular model when you have side-effects.

2013-09-10 05:58:29	beardtree	yansanmo: because it's not stupid -- it realizes that each dep of your project has its own dependencies, so it installs them for your projects' dependency specifically, as opposed to globally

2013-09-10 12:21:07	Maxdamantus	try-catch translate perfectly well to machine code with most sensible implementation strategies on most platforms you're likely to find.

2013-09-10 12:24:16	Maxdamantus	it's extremely quick in Java, essentially the same as what a usual C compiler will produce for setjmp/longjmp.
2013-09-10 12:24:38	Maxdamantus	but usually people do something like `throw new Foo()`, which involves constructing an object, which is usually slow.

2013-09-10 22:09:50	PigDude	overburn, yea, but start w/ something small like backbone because with angular and ember, a lot of design choices are made for you. more importantly, while you can sling any old OO design and make it work in either framework, you have to do it all through their APIs (particularly angular)

2013-09-10 22:10:24	PigDude	overburn, so defining a "class" in angular is very different from in your typical JS app, etc. this is just because of how dependency injections works in angular, once you get past that there isn't much to figure out

2013-09-11 11:47:03	OneBraveHog	so I'd like to play oh ? 10 or 20 sounds at the same time
2013-09-11 11:47:03	fuzzybunny69y	sykopomp I am trying to understand variable scope
2013-09-11 11:47:07	OneBraveHog	same with clapping
2013-09-11 11:47:09	sykopomp	oh god and they're using document.write
2013-09-11 11:47:13	fuzzybunny69y	so I am messing around testing stuff
2013-09-11 11:47:20	OneBraveHog	what's wrong with document.write ?
2013-09-11 11:47:25	sykopomp	!document.write
2013-09-11 11:47:25	OneBraveHog	 just learning
2013-09-11 11:47:25	ecmabot	sykopomp: document.wrong. Please use something more modern and less prone to doing confusing things. This function tries to write to the current document. If the document has already been processed, the document will be replaced with a blank one with your argument. If you don't want that, use the proper DOM methods instead.

2013-09-11 11:47:32	OneBraveHog	hahahaha
2013-09-11 11:47:36	Krauzi	OneBraveHog hm cant help you with that since i haven't done any music stuff in JS before
2013-09-11 11:47:53	OneBraveHog	I find so little out there
2013-09-11 11:47:54	Krauzi	maybe dynamically load HTML objects with JS which play sounds and then remove them afterwards
2013-09-11 11:47:57	sykopomp	fuzzybunny69y: scoping in JS is simple: it's basic lexical scoping with variable capture for functions.
2013-09-11 11:48:00	sykopomp	done.
2013-09-11 11:48:15	sykopomp	(so you can have proper closures that maintain references to the original variable instances)

2013-09-11 11:48:22	Krauzi	so guys, any answer on my pervious question? ---> hm a question for understanding OOP a little bit better in JS: for writing methods i use this: OBJ.prototype.FUNC = function() { this....; } can someone explain me why in this case this doesnt point to the function but to the object?
2013-09-11 11:48:31	RangerMauve	fuzzybunny69y: Sorry, I'm playing tf2 at the moment. :P\
2013-09-11 11:48:32	fuzzybunny69y	lol sykopomp I have no idea what that means lol
2013-09-11 11:48:43	fuzzybunny69y	;)
2013-09-11 11:48:48	sykopomp	fuzzybunny69y: it means scoping works like you read it.
2013-09-11 11:48:55	fuzzybunny69y	what is lexical scoping ;)
2013-09-11 11:48:57	sykopomp	fuzzybunny69y: var establishes a new variable if it's inside a new scope.

2013-09-11 11:49:14	fuzzybunny69y	oh ok
2013-09-11 11:49:20	sykopomp	so if instead of global you have `var`, that variable will be a new variable.
2013-09-11 11:49:27	sykopomp	and will not affect the outer outsideMessage
2013-09-11 11:49:40	sykopomp	'lexical' means "how it reads"
2013-09-11 11:50:01	sykopomp	so if you can look at the source code and follow the scoping of the source code, that's what the variables will refer to at runtime.
2013-09-11 11:50:30	fuzzybunny69y	what is variable capture for functions
2013-09-11 11:50:32	fuzzybunny69y	?
2013-09-11 11:50:37	sykopomp	closures
2013-09-11 11:50:49	sykopomp	which are more complicated and will take you... not 5 minutes to understand.
2013-09-11 11:50:54	sykopomp	I suggest you google them.
2013-09-11 11:51:04	sykopomp	there's a ton of material out there on them.
2013-09-11 11:51:08	sykopomp	and I need sleep.

2013-09-11 13:34:24	MJCD	I just had another idea for a game, I think it's probably been done before somewhat
2013-09-11 13:34:38	MJCD	but basically the idea would be to turn your life into a scoreable game.
2013-09-11 13:35:00	MJCD	kind of taking foursquare to a new level of invasiveness
2013-09-11 13:35:01	MJCD	but it could be all offline :D
2013-09-11 13:35:12	Moeh	Hey, what is the recommended my to structure js applications with regards to callbacks. Say for instance, I would like to do something like: var location = getLocation(); and use location.longitude afterwards. It is better to include the file with the getLocation function or do a require? And how can I make sure that the location was received before assigning it? (callbacks or custom events?)
2013-09-11 13:35:24	Moeh	*way
2013-09-11 13:35:32	MJCD	It'd be cool to build it as an app for google glass
2013-09-11 13:35:40	MJCD	so you could detect if you were doing a bad habbit

In Chrome you can open the dev tools, go to the network tab, click record and trigger your function. The ajax request will be listed, and you will be able to see whether or not it was actually sent (it will probably say "Cancelled" under status).

I was thinking about custom events, but if I have it after the return statement the event won't get fired and if it is before the return then location is still <null>

It would work fine if i could just send it a giant xml of my entire system layout, but that it too much data to send.  So what i want to do is when the user tries to expand a folder, dynamically grab the list of files/folders in the expanded folder from the server, and then display it in the tree
2013-09-11 16:20:45	harbhub	remember fellas, whistle while you twerk
2013-09-11 16:21:24	PigDude	bberry_, hm i remember using extjs they had a tree widget that could load children over HTTP when a node was expande
2013-09-11 16:21:33	bberry_	PigDude: So i was planning to use JSON to have stuff like the file name, file type, etc for each node
2013-09-11 16:21:35	PigDude	bberry_, maybe your tree widget just doesn't have this
2013-09-11 16:21:40	PigDude	sure
2013-09-11 16:21:52	PigDude	i'd use a language other than bash if possible though ... it can't even be that fast

Example code to add the method in IE8 uses the === operator, but then I also see examples such as http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_indexof_array.asp using .indexOf to search for strings which I thought might be == even when they are not ===. Who wants to deconfuse me please? :)
