2013-03-21 22:15:17	taylanub	But yeah, running two instances is generally .. not the way you use Emacs.  Many people "boot" Emacs when they boot their underlying OS, and use that instance until shutting down.
2013-03-21 22:15:29	cofi	zeltak1: emacs sets frame/window properties too late if you have that in mind to ove them around

2013-03-21 22:15:47	cluck	zeltak1: you can but the daemon alternative is probably a better idea (unless you're doing something that blocks emacs, which is a bad idea if it's happening)
2013-03-21 22:16:15	taylanub	cofi: Oh, not the first time I'm hearing that .. is Gnus really better than a stand-alone mail client ?
2013-03-21 22:16:24	syrinx	yes
2013-03-21 22:16:28	zeltak1	ok guys so go for the deamon mehtod and look into instances for each emacs "app" i want?
2013-03-21 22:16:28	syrinx	and no
2013-03-21 22:16:35	taylanub	Heh, OK.

2013-03-21 22:17:34	zeltak1	cofi: will each instance have differnt windows properties (xprop could see)?
2013-03-21 22:17:42	syrinx	I usually keep one seperate instance just for erc
2013-03-21 22:18:00	taylanub	The daemon is one instance.  Frames aren't instances ..

2013-03-21 22:21:00	cluck	taylanub: gnus is awesome, sadly it's also a slow heavy beast that's stubborn to handle and hell to setup for newcomers with non-trivial setups (if you can live with that you won't wanna live without it)
