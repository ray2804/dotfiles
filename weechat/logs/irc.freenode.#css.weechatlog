2013-04-23 20:49:39	jParkton	I can understand to an extent but when someone corrects English it should not be simply "Haha you say wrong, you dumb foreigner" it should be more for clarity, ask questions don't just point and laugh

2013-04-23 21:04:06	GarethAdams	the key to tabular data is that every item in a column, and every item in a row, are related in some way
2013-04-23 21:04:11	Qbix1	tables for layout is one thing. But why do people go out of their way to use divs and li's for things that clearly have several fields?

2013-04-24 22:02:55	yoshie902a	Hi all, emergency. we just launched a website and now we are getting calls that it does not work in IE 8 and before.   Are there resources to run tests on what code is incompatible?  Also, is there a way to extract the rendered CSS directly from the browser to eliminate any media queries?
2013-04-24 22:02:57	Cow_woC	aFeijo: Not sure, but you could use JS to remove the transition before fading back on, then re-set the transition again.

I have used debug tools for firefox/chrome on mac (my machine) and was hoping for a tool to down load a rendered version of the CSS, with the media query stuff removed and only show the CSS specific to the current view.  Is there any way to do this?

2013-04-25 00:58:51	jParkton	ohai
2013-04-25 00:59:08	Cow_woC	What's a good way to implement a fixed-size column on the right, and a dynamic-sized column on the left that grows to fill the remaining space?

2013-04-25 00:59:19	Cow_woC	reisio, jParkton: Hi guys :)
2013-04-25 00:59:34	Cow_woC	I tried http://stackoverflow.com/q/16201617/14731 but as you can see I ran into some nasty bugs.
2013-04-25 01:00:04	Cow_woC	Is there a way to implement this without some hacky margin-right?

2013-04-25 01:02:32	jParkton	no clue really, as with all things programming if $A doesnt work as expected use $B
2013-04-25 01:02:58	reisio	Cow_woC: ordinary float: http://css.maxdesign.com.au/floatutorial/
2013-04-25 01:03:26	Cow_woC	reisio: I tried that, but it doesn't jive well with max-width/height on the left column
2013-04-25 01:03:58	reisio	how so?
2013-04-25 01:04:14	Cow_woC	reisio: Meaning, when you shrink the window horizontally, eventually the float needs to squeeze the left column but instead one just goes into one row and another into another row.

2013-04-25 01:05:36	Cow_woC	reisio: I want the columns to always extend from top to bottom. The left column fills the remaining space (down to 0). The right column always keeps its width.

2013-04-25 01:06:58	Cow_woC	The right column should have a width from say 200px down to 0px. It should also shrink as the window shrinks, but it should only begin shrinking after the left column has a width of 0.

2013-04-25 01:08:21	Cow_woC	I just changed my mind :) Okay... so I guess what I want is *both* columns to shrink to fit the screen... kind of like left column has 80%, right column 20%, but I also want to cap the maximum size of the right to say 200px. Is it possible to mix width: 20%, max-width: 200px?
2013-04-25 01:09:41	Cow_woC	Hmm, that worked :)
2013-04-25 01:10:07	reisio	gj
2013-04-25 01:10:17	Cow_woC	Sorry, nevermind then. I only thought about the 80/20% thing a few minutes ago. I was trying to use fixed width on the right before without giving the left a width.

2013-04-25 07:29:11	AMcBain	The silly thing is there's a picture-hosting site for a certain interest group built on frames and tables ... it didn't have keyboard navigation and someone asked a dev to do it. I managed to whip it up in Greasemonkey and it worked cross-frame, so focus in another meant left/right still worked as expected ... but the site dev wouldn't do it because it was "insecure" ... even worse, really, was that if any of the markup changes, either (
2013-04-25 07:29:11	AMcBain	I think) of those scripts will die.
2013-04-25 07:29:30	AMcBain	There's no class names or IDs on the appropriate things. It's "find the 3rd tr on this page, and if it has one or two anchors in it, we found the right place"
2013-04-25 07:29:46	AMcBain	Without tables, that would be so much easier and less fragile.

2013-04-25 07:30:34	AMcBain	and the script to do it is incredibly short.

2013-04-25 10:17:24	AMcBain	Schonert, what I suggest is either a) black out around it so the letter boxing isn't obvious, b) design around the letter boxing so it looks better, c) use some media queries (if possible?) or JavaScript to determine which dimension is smaller. Set that one to 100%.

2013-04-25 11:14:45	alex___	When you float an element to wrap around it some text, something, you want the rest of the content not to write
2013-04-25 11:15:18	alex___	you use clear on the next element you don't want to wrap, and that works
2013-04-25 11:16:03	alex___	but when the element parent is delimited with a background-color or border, it does not consider the floatted element which overflow and that sucks
2013-04-25 11:16:22	alex___	that is why many designer add this at the end of the parent div :
2013-04-25 11:16:23	alex___	<p style="clear:both">&nbsp;</p>

2013-04-25 23:32:36	herbnerder	and the other (admittedly small) is that user zoom is taken into account. so if somebody were to bump the font size up manually your media queries would account for that
2013-04-25 23:32:54	reisio	hrmm?
2013-04-25 23:32:59	herbnerder	but, that's a pretty small benefit

2013-04-25 23:34:06	reisio	yeah?
2013-04-25 23:34:17	herbnerder	if the user bumps up their font size so much that the 3 column media query is no longer true, it will use the tablet based layout

2013-04-30 10:44:30	hawtin	anymore :)
2013-04-30 10:44:46	reisio	doesn’t matter, because Lady_Aleena hasn’t even found something IE8 doesn’t support to use yet
2013-04-30 10:45:15	hawtin	really?
2013-04-30 10:45:25	hawtin	i can't even support my sprites
2013-04-30 10:45:32	hawtin	cause they are doubling every image
2013-04-30 10:45:33	reisio	pardon?
2013-04-30 10:45:35	hawtin	in IE8:))
2013-04-30 10:45:51	reisio	I’m not sure what you just said, but it doesn’t matter, because Lady_Aleena isn’t using sprites
2013-04-30 10:45:55	Lady_Aleena	reisio, I tried "aside", and when I went to style it in the <style> tag, IE8 didn't display "aside" as I wished.
2013-04-30 10:46:19	hawtin	IE8 doesnt do alot of things
2013-04-30 10:46:21	Lady_Aleena	Sprites?
2013-04-30 10:46:24	hawtin	so x_x
2013-04-30 10:46:25	hawtin	yes
2013-04-30 10:46:34	hawtin	put all your images in one
2013-04-30 10:46:40	reisio	Lady_Aleena: that’s unfortunate, but the aside element is just a glorified <p class="aside">

2013-04-30 10:47:07	hawtin	not big images

2013-04-30 10:47:15	reisio	Lady_Aleena: you could also have tried applying CSS to it to make it appear as you wish, as frequently even without supporting an element by default, a browser will style it if you tell it to
2013-04-30 10:47:18	Lady_Aleena	I don't use images on my site.
2013-04-30 10:47:33	reisio	fewer http requests is overrated
2013-04-30 10:47:37	hawtin	lol
2013-04-30 10:47:41	hawtin	overrated my ass
2013-04-30 10:47:59	hawtin	so is having your css in one row ?

2013-04-30 10:48:26	reisio	having your css in one way isn’t overrated, it’s overused (in that it’s used at all)

2013-04-30 10:50:37	hawtin	to make a site only for IE8 and lower

I am currently using Wordpress and i need to add a different image class to a shortcode, currently the theme is the retailer and i want it so that when using the shortcode [banner_simple] the image is gray but goes to color on hover, in functions.php it has the image set to background-image:url('.$bg_image.')" could i define a specific class to just the background image?

2013-05-01 03:44:17	Selvvir	sinistersnare, Always provide a link to a *live* page or pared-down testcase so we can see the problem in action. Looking at code or images alone usually isn't very effective. Also see `paste and `testcase.

2013-05-01 05:26:42	AMcBain	preaction, nope, worse. First, it defaults to IE7 compatibility view rendering. Next, if you want to change that you either have to disable it for all applications or tell it per application executable file name what you want it to be forced to compatibility mode render it as (or the default "latest standards mode" rendering of whatever you have installed)

So you're forced to do it on the fly and run some line of This.That.Foo.GetWhatever().Name to get your current executable file name.

2013-05-01 06:11:20	AMcBain	petey, well if you moved #youtube before #welcome, youtube could be floated right. instead of the "span7" "span5" stuff they both have right now.
2013-05-01 06:11:22	petey	im recreating the website
2013-05-01 06:11:40	petey	im just looking at the way bootstrap grids work and that's what they tell me to do
2013-05-01 06:11:53	AMcBain	because there's something wrong with the current one?
2013-05-01 06:12:04	petey	yes
2013-05-01 06:12:13	AMcBain	Which is?
2013-05-01 06:12:20	petey	its been hijacked old designer is gone and no one knows how to get into the concrete5 installation

2013-05-01 06:13:24	TheCowboy	petey, one thing you can try is putting the middle in a box of 940px with overflow hidden, and taking off the -20px margin and see if that does it

2013-05-01 06:14:28	TheCowboy	but usually it's better(when using bootstrap) to just size your graphics within the widths bootstrap sets than toying with it
2013-05-01 06:14:39	petey	amcbain because we just want to get it up and running as fast as possible and everyone likes the current layout

2013-05-01 06:16:14	petey	i guess ill just start with restructuring everything and i guess i will resize the background images to fit
2013-05-01 06:16:38	TheCowboy	i'd resize the header and footer images to the width of the containers

2013-05-01 07:26:42	iaj	i got 2 questions.. would you solve something like this http://is.gd/jRqNRw, eg the whole conatiner here. with images or pure css?
2013-05-01 07:26:59	iaj	and the second thing, is... checkbox styling is rather tricky in css right?
2013-05-01 07:27:54	AMcBain	You can get the cut corners with CSS, if you don't mind cheating and fooling the user.
2013-05-01 07:28:21	gavilan2	iaj: you can do everything with css3...
2013-05-01 07:28:23	iaj	AMcBain: would you advice on doing so?
2013-05-01 07:28:30	iaj	or rather stick to css?
2013-05-01 07:28:34	iaj	arg.. images. sorry
2013-05-01 07:28:35	gavilan2	but if you want a lot of browser compatibility, it's probably a bad idea
2013-05-01 07:28:45	gavilan2	olders browsers don't work well with that stuff...
2013-05-01 07:28:49	AMcBain	gavilan2, CSS triangles worked before CSS3.
2013-05-01 07:29:14	gavilan2	AMcBain: which css version then?
2013-05-01 07:29:14	AMcBain	iaj, all depends on you, really. The corners could be covered by up pseudo-elements styled as CSS triangles.
2013-05-01 07:29:23	RingtailedFox	heya, guys... i have some css questions... i have one css file that contains these following lines: @font-face { font-family: "Square 721 BT"; src: url("Square721BT.TTF"); } body {background: #000000; color: #FFD700; font-family: "Square 721 BT";} h1 {background: #000000; color: #FFD700; font-family: "Square 721 BT";} p {background: #000000; color: #FFD700; font-family: "Square 721 BT";}...  but i would like to incorporate them into

2013-05-01 07:29:40	gavilan2	nice...

2013-05-01 07:30:09	AMcBain	iaj, checkboxes are also similarly a trick, you can't really style them for reasons of being "replaced content" elements. However, you can cover them up.
2013-05-01 07:30:14	AMcBain	with whatever you want.
2013-05-01 07:30:30	gavilan2	AMcBain: You can also implement your own checkbox
2013-05-01 07:30:54	AMcBain	True, but if you intend to submit it as an actual form, then having real elements might be nice.

2013-05-01 07:32:21	gavilan2	iaj: images are good!
2013-05-01 07:32:25	AMcBain	This is an example I have of styling radio buttons: http://temp.asmcbain.net/htmlcss/form-2/form-2.html
2013-05-01 07:32:35	AMcBain	Same could be done for checkboxes.

2013-05-01 07:33:19	AMcBain	iaj, so do it as part of the background and break the background up into multiple pieces.

2013-05-01 07:33:39	AMcBain	CSS3 added support for multiple background images. If you need support back further than that (such as in IE), then use pseudo-elements for the end caps.
2013-05-01 07:33:42	AMcBain	That will get you down to IE8.

2013-05-01 07:34:00	iaj	So I'm using multiple backgrounds for the surrounding div.
2013-05-01 07:34:17	AMcBain	The link I gave you for the radio buttons (also applicable to the checkboxes) should work down to IE8.

2013-05-01 07:45:47	AMcBain	You can't just grab a font off your own system and host it, as it is most likely one you need to buy from the foundary to use, and not licensed for the web in any case.

2013-05-01 07:51:56	paulvd	why is fond rendering (google fonts) so poor in some browsers or websites
2013-05-01 07:51:59	AMcBain	Well, not quite. The problem is fonts can be downloaded from your server by people or applications other than the browser. There's not really any good way to protect from that. So the net effect is that someone could get it for free.

2013-05-01 08:14:55	AMcBain	airco, well ... I'd figure out why the relative path fails first.
2013-05-01 08:15:02	AMcBain	It's definitely more preferable than using a full path.
2013-05-01 08:15:08	AMcBain	Less work if things change.
2013-05-01 08:15:43	AMcBain	It seems to work just fine as "button0.png" for the path, so I would use that. Perhaps the first time around you had the wrong file name.
2013-05-01 08:16:55	Lady_Aleena	I would just use plain text "buttons". ">" for play, "||" for pause, "<<" for rewind, ">>" for fast forward, and "0" for stop or something. Then again, I decided to go completely image free for my site.

I need the submenu to have a 100% width while the parent menu maintain a specific menu.. the submenu is a row which pops up on top of the menu (if that makes sense). Is this possible with css, since the sub list will always inherit the width of the parent when using % right?

2013-05-01 22:21:23	lakcaj	reisio, I posted this yesterday and the only solution was to add a margin-top to the right column.  I would like the text in both columns, regardless of font size, to be aligned at the top, but maintain the line-height: 1.4 for aesthetics.  The problem with applying a margin is it will vary depending on the difference in font sizes.  I was wondering if you maybe had a better solution?  Here's a link: http://jsfiddle.ne

I'm guessing it's because one of the parents doesn't have it's position set but I haven't been able to identify which one. Yes, the html is pretty shitty and has errors. Not my fault and I don't have full time to fix it for him yet… so please, any help without sarcasm would be much appreciated.

2013-05-02 05:06:22	AMcBain	FreezingCold, but my comment wasn't on whether or not you could get CSS table styles to do what you want, but that if you wanted them to be equal width, the list + regular non-table CSS styles would have been a better end goal.

2013-05-02 05:19:43	AMcBain	If it's not, then left or right align it and fill the extra space with something useful.

2013-05-02 06:52:00	mezzie911	and i think it's because while it's all the left it can go the wrapper is too narrow
2013-05-02 06:52:18	cheshirecatspazz	are you using float or align?

2013-05-02 07:44:48	AMcBain	paul_, nope! CSS3 builds upon the previous CSS specifications, so nothing special. However, given that, it also follows the same rules in that imcomplete, non-standard, or wrong/improper implementations of features should be prefixed.
2013-05-02 07:45:19	AMcBain	As it stands, I believe WebKit and Opera require prefixes.

2013-05-02 07:47:41	paul_	well i had my "a" element set to "width : 200px" , and under "a:hover", i forgot to set a "width 220px" for the "transition: width 2s;" to actually function on
2013-05-02 07:47:56	AMcBain	AH.
2013-05-02 07:47:57	AMcBain	Ah*
2013-05-02 07:48:26	paul_	there's no way to affect other elements (using just css) with "uniqueId:hover", right?
2013-05-02 07:48:31	AMcBain	I should also note, not saying that you did, that the transition declaration generally needs to be on the base state in order to work in both directions.
2013-05-02 07:48:59	AMcBain	So if you put transition: ...; inside a :hover, it may only work when you hover the element, but snap back when you move the mouse off.
2013-05-02 07:49:17	AMcBain	paul_, nope, you totally can, as long as they're selectable from that element.
2013-05-02 07:49:41	paul_	but how could i select an element outside of it? I was thinking of selecting the siblings
2013-05-02 07:49:42	AMcBain	#element1 ~ div -> all divs that are siblings and past #element1 on the DOM.
2013-05-02 07:49:56	AMcBain	#element1 + blah -> any blah immediately following a #element1.
2013-05-02 07:50:00	AMcBain	Just add :hover, :active, whatever.

2013-05-02 21:16:35	scar	Just  curious on people's opinion
2013-05-02 21:16:58	acr0	scar, I do use them
2013-05-02 21:17:05	acr0	FernandoBasso, http://css-tricks.com/examples/hrs/
2013-05-02 21:17:48	FernandoBasso	acr0: I came across that one too. Very nice indeed.
2013-05-02 21:17:55	acr0	FernandoBasso, if you still end up having trouble with <hr /> you could just use a div with a 1px height
2013-05-02 21:18:01	acr0	maybe not the best semantic solution, but it works :)
2013-05-02 21:18:24	FernandoBasso	Sure.

2013-05-03 00:17:12	nemo	RabSimpson: and we own what we do with ourselves
2013-05-03 00:17:27	RabSimpson	nemo: we're made up of stuff which was here billions of years prior and will remain for billions after we're gone, we don't own that
2013-05-03 00:17:29	RingtailedFox	besides, that does not answer my question of "do i become debt-free if i give all my money to seomeone else?"

2013-05-03 00:18:37	RabSimpson	look, if you guys don't get it that's not my responsibility. go learn how fiat banking works and you'll find out what you do and don't own.

2013-05-03 04:08:46	paul_	is there a way to have a parent (such as a navbar), be somewhat opaque (opacity:0.8;) for eg, but have the child be at 1.0 opacity?

2013-05-03 04:10:45	AMcBain	paul_, use rgba or hsla as a background color instead of the opacity property.
2013-05-03 04:11:09	paul_	but wouldn't that take away the effect of opacity??
2013-05-03 04:12:10	AMcBain	The 'a' in rgb*a* is alpha. transparency. opacity. whatever you want to call it.

2013-05-03 04:13:35	AMcBain	With the opacity property, nothing can be more opaque than 1. Since such is the case, children cannot be more opaque than their parent. Thus you cannot have a child appear opaque if a parent has an opacity < 1. Just so you know.

2013-05-03 06:55:18	AMcBain	Probably a z-index issue.
2013-05-03 06:55:35	Heist	How do I use z-index to push those images back
2013-05-03 06:55:46	Heist	so that they don't kill my drop downs :(
2013-05-03 06:56:02	AMcBain	It would probably be easier to make the container of the menus have a higher z-index than the content (or the default assigned to the content) than to fix all the possible content.
2013-05-03 06:56:32	Heist	The higher the Z-index the farther back they go?
2013-05-03 06:56:41	MrGate	Heist it looks super simple
2013-05-03 06:56:54	Heist	It's very elementary. Just a simple database
2013-05-03 06:56:54	MrGate	remove the underline on log in
2013-05-03 06:56:55	AMcBain	Heist, no.
2013-05-03 06:57:01	AMcBain	Heist, higher z-index = closer to the top.
2013-05-03 06:57:12	AMcBain	Generally.
2013-05-03 06:57:24	AMcBain	There is some stuff with parents that have a z-index and stacking rules, etc. but overall that's kinda it.
2013-05-03 06:57:28	Heist	So go into the css, and change the menu to a higher Z than the content in the menu?
2013-05-03 06:57:52	MrGate	just the container your using for the navigation
2013-05-03 06:57:55	AMcBain	Why would that help? Isn't the overlapping content from the main content area of the layout?
2013-05-03 06:58:02	MrGate	then anything in it should have the same z-index
2013-05-03 06:58:21	MrGate	but i recommend removing the underline on login
2013-05-03 06:58:32	MrGate	it looks like a 2 year old did that

2013-05-03 13:34:57	xec	and it sort of looks like you're on a wild goose chase. i'm not sure what style.php is, maybe a generated file over what's in the /styles folder? google gave me this http://area51.phpbb.com/docs/30x/coding-guidelines.html
2013-05-03 13:36:03	xec	Pangaea: the statement you started out with would indeed change from a solid color to an image. but the overriding rule is in style.php so you need to figure out what that is

2013-05-03 22:12:22	kopoba	samholmes but i dont see the proble there is 2 background  as he want
2013-05-03 22:12:32	samholmes	1. load this page http://jsbin.com/oritan/1 2. resize window width below 800px 3. scroll to the right. What I want to happen: header moves the the left when scrolling to the right. What happens: the header stays fixed and you cannot see the right side of the header when scrolling to the right.

2013-05-04 06:27:40	RNT	that`s good news :)
2013-05-04 06:27:47	AMcBain	Blink = fork of WebKit = same WebKit problems at the outset :P

2013-05-04 06:28:15	vaerros	yeah
2013-05-04 06:28:36	AMcBain	I fully expect them to introduce more WTFs while refactoring it like the promised.
2013-05-04 06:28:58	AMcBain	The good news is that because of the refactoring promise, they won't be able to send pull requests to WebKit, so the WTFness stays local.
2013-05-04 06:29:21	AMcBain	The incompatibility should at least be good for that.
2013-05-04 06:30:05	AMcBain	but I do have to give props to WebKit itself, it appears you can animate -webkit-transform now in more cases than I believe you used to be able to, if not anything. It works rather well.

2013-05-04 06:31:33	AMcBain	It has a backface issue too, but that can be fixed by turning them off if they shouldn't show up anyway./

2013-05-04 06:34:18	AMcBain	Some of which may or may not have been fixed, I recall letting them know about them. One was that outlines were resistant to opacity changes.
2013-05-04 06:34:36	AMcBain	I had some thing where I would fade them to 0 or whatever, and all would disappear but the outlines.
2013-05-04 06:35:09	RNT	i have another question too, i noticed many ppl using -moz-border-radius 2px; -webkit-border-radius:2px; border-radius:2px;
2013-05-04 06:35:15	RNT	what is the point?
2013-05-04 06:35:41	AMcBain	To not have one. It rounds the corners. :)
2013-05-04 06:35:47	RNT	because what i tested, i don't realy need to add 3 times the same shit, the result is the same anyway
2013-05-04 06:36:09	AMcBain	Ah, yes, all major browsers have unprefixed it.
2013-05-04 06:36:24	AMcBain	If you need to target Firefox 3.6.x, that's the last time you need -moz-
2013-05-04 06:36:33	RNT	i see
2013-05-04 06:36:44	RNT	so, i don't need to worry about it
2013-05-04 06:36:49	AMcBain	Nope.
2013-05-04 06:37:57	RNT	me, i think is your bussines to update your browser, not mine to make the web page compatible with your old browser
2013-05-04 06:38:01	jamesdotnet	RNT: I think you should change the background color to #C0FFEE
2013-05-04 06:38:01	RNT	i'm right?
2013-05-04 06:38:21	RNT	page background?
2013-05-04 06:38:32	RNT	or for that element?

2013-05-04 06:38:51	AMcBain	You should make sure that for a reasonable number of versions back the site is navigable.
2013-05-04 06:39:00	AMcBain	That means that you can at least view and read content, even if it's not the prettiest.
2013-05-04 06:39:25	AMcBain	It's not really such a big deal for other browsers, but IE. and there I think "2 back" is now IE8. So that's not so bad either.

2013-05-04 06:40:29	jamesdotnet	IE8 is the new IE6

2013-05-04 09:29:18	santori	i copy that markup into the child style.css

2013-05-04 12:13:59	linduxed	hey guys! i want to make a fixed header like the one found on http://www.gog.com/. i don't have a problem with the fixed part, i'm mostly concerned with how they do the centered menus
2013-05-04 12:15:05	linduxed	looking at the page in firebug, the header is called mainNav, and contains a right (empty) div, the menu div and a left (empty) div
2013-05-04 12:15:19	ravenzz	that's quite silly
2013-05-04 12:15:28	oksushi	they do it in a pretty shitty way, requiring two empty divs to 'fill out' the left and right sides
2013-05-04 12:15:45	linduxed	that's possible, i'm not so sharp on this stuff myself

2013-05-04 12:16:28	linduxed	just to have a nice fixed header, which limits its content to the width of the rest of the page
2013-05-04 12:16:32	ravenzz	and a load of padding negative left values
2013-05-04 12:16:47	ravenzz	linduxed you should paste your markup somewhere

2013-05-04 12:40:33	airwalker	Hi I have a trivial problem but my understanding of CSS is not fantastic.  http://jsfiddle.net/a8peT/  I am constructing a table, wrapping text causes other cells in the row to move down.  Firstly is using divs a correct way to construct the table? What about the inline block? Removing the spacing between inline block siblings using negative word-spacing.  Comments / advice appreciated please. :-)

2013-05-05 02:44:58	jamesdotnet	I was thinking more along the lines... To avoid duplicate content issues with example.com/home and example.com/HOME, you might decide to redirect all requests to lowercase, and then your example.com/camelCase.css URL would break if the server is case sensitive.

2013-05-05 03:23:38	bluesm	AMcBain: Ok. I got that. I should be relative to the width and height of font. So it is reasonable to set height with "ex" and width with "em"

2013-05-05 03:24:24	AMcBain	bluesm, depends on what you're doing. Sometimes you really do want a 300px wide box and text inside it should just wrap.

2013-05-05 03:25:43	AMcBain	If you want it proportional to the element itself, perhaps use the units of the height and width. If you always want it to be a fixed "roundedness" use pixels
2013-05-05 03:26:18	AMcBain	There's a lot of stuff on the web that's really dependent on what you want and what you're doing. Just like anything else, there's no silver bullet.

2013-05-05 06:02:34	AMcBain	boytoy_, if that's your reason for minifying, that's stupid. People can and will "pretify" it, and trace it out.
2013-05-05 06:03:01	boytoy_	AMcBain: it's one of many reasons
2013-05-05 06:03:04	AMcBain	Most minify to save on bandwidth / download costs and times.
2013-05-05 06:03:05	boytoy_	don't hate
2013-05-05 06:03:08	herbnerder	no it isn't
2013-05-05 06:03:56	AMcBain	boytoy_, if it's one of your reasons, it's stupid :) lets say you don't put a license, or claim the copyright on it, and you're from some place that doesn't recognize implicit copyright (or perhaps even if you are) on it. Someone comes along, unminifies it, understands it, and steals it. Now what?
2013-05-05 06:04:15	AMcBain	They could claim you didn't exert ownership over it and provided no means to protect it.
2013-05-05 06:04:31	boytoy_	hehe
2013-05-05 06:04:37	boytoy_	i expect that to happen
2013-05-05 06:04:38	AMcBain	Minifying something is like a speed bump. You might consider slowing down, but it won't stop you.
2013-05-05 06:04:58	boytoy_	but either way, even if they copy my js, my design will still remain superior
2013-05-05 06:05:13	AMcBain	It will? I think I remember the sort of stuff you create.
2013-05-05 06:05:14	boytoy_	copy that, and i have a reason to fuck you up in court
2013-05-05 06:05:23	lewix	so basically when its compiled you can't read the css even with firebugs?
2013-05-05 06:05:35	oksushi	lewix: no, you can 'read' any CSS easily
2013-05-05 06:05:37	AMcBain	lewix, no, Firebug is perfectly capable :)

2013-05-05 06:06:09	AMcBain	lewix, minified or generated CSS is only a potential parsing problem to humans. If the browser can understand it, then the browser developer tools can make it nicer for you to read.
2013-05-05 06:06:10	oksushi	…
2013-05-05 06:06:15	boytoy_	and we will pay you a "personal visit"
2013-05-05 06:06:20	AMcBain	boytoy_, you sound like an idiot.
2013-05-05 06:06:29	oksushi	boytoy_: your first mistake was thinking that anyone wants to copy your work
2013-05-05 06:06:29	lewix	ok thank you
2013-05-05 06:06:30	AMcBain	s/sound like/are/
2013-05-05 06:07:14	AMcBain	lewix, unless you've got really huge stylesheets (which is a bad thing in and of itself, probably) or a lot of them, there's no real need/point to minifying them.
2013-05-05 06:07:36	AMcBain	The generated ones are just from tools that some people find easier to work with to compose styles, such as SASS, LESS, Stylus, etc.
2013-05-05 06:08:05	lewix	ok
2013-05-05 06:08:22	boytoy_	oksushi: hehe
2013-05-05 06:08:26	boytoy_	wishful thinking i guess
2013-05-05 06:08:26	AMcBain	In the too-many-sheets scenario, if you concatenated them in the right order minified, a client would have to download one file and smaller.

2013-05-05 06:19:58	AMcBain	Why always put the shadow on the *outside* of the box? :)
2013-05-05 06:20:10	preaction	the code is already protected by copyright. it is illegal to copy/paste any part of it to your own work if you do not have a license. how hard is this to understand?
2013-05-05 06:21:01	AMcBain	preaction, not all countries have the same rules as the US. The US grants an implicit copyright to works you have created in lieu of other agreements (such as ownership of work done for companies, etc.), but I don't think everyone else.
2013-05-05 06:21:09	AMcBain	else? I meant does.
2013-05-05 06:21:24	preaction	if they're a signatory to the Berne convention on copyright, then yes they do
2013-05-05 06:21:40	AMcBain	It is still better in any case to explicitly claim it with a statment somewhere in the code or on the site.
2013-05-05 06:21:42	Havvy	Which is a faster selector?  .rare.common or .common.rare ?
2013-05-05 06:21:45	boytoy_	yeah
2013-05-05 06:21:54	preaction	Havvy, probably neither
2013-05-05 06:22:05	boytoy_	90% of the sites on the www belong to countries that adhere to the berne convention so
2013-05-05 06:22:53	boytoy_	i dont recall who made that estimate but
2013-05-05 06:22:58	boytoy_	some dude at mit
2013-05-05 06:23:02	AMcBain	Havvy, both are the same type of selector so I agree with preaction. The occurance ratio of them shouldn't affect speed of matching.
2013-05-05 06:24:02	preaction	don't even get me started on the "no-license" """"movement""""
2013-05-05 06:24:10	preaction	does four air-quotes make it more sarcastic?
2013-05-05 06:24:20	AMcBain	No, it makes it wiki markup ;)

2013-05-05 06:25:39	Havvy	AMcBain: I would think the occurrence ratio  could affect the speed of matching for false negatives.

2013-05-05 06:27:01	AMcBain	Havvy, unless they've got some "special cases" built in to the processor, it's still evaulated the same as any other selector. Reality is that it's going to vary by rendering engine and only empirical testing can tell you what you want to know.
2013-05-05 06:27:32	AMcBain	Shorter of it: CSS is a spec. How it's implemented, as long as it conforms, is not defined.

2013-05-05 06:29:54	AMcBain	I remember for work having to e-mail someone because there was no license listing for some code this guy did that for, probably not intentionally, so that we wouldn't have a chance of getting in trouble.
2013-05-05 06:30:26	boytoy_	Havvy: bsd doesnt hold that well either
2013-05-05 06:30:36	preaction	but without copyright, you truly could simply take everything that anyone ever did and copy it all you wanted and no artistic endeavor would ever make a dime and we'd be back to government patronage

2013-05-05 06:31:44	AMcBain	preaction, I believe one of the CC licenses might have made it to court, but I don't remember which, as they've got localized versions, and X variants ...
2013-05-05 06:32:14	boytoy_	preaction: yeah all cases have always been "third party"

2013-05-05 06:56:43	AMcBain	Yay! A CSS question.
2013-05-05 06:57:20	alphanumb	AMcBain, are you bored?
2013-05-05 06:57:44	AMcBain	alphanumb, no, but I think our previous conversation beat the dead horse to bloody bits.
2013-05-05 06:58:00	AMcBain	alphanumb, also, inline styles are bad.
2013-05-05 06:58:17	alphanumb	haha, I don't remember our previous conversation. and I know they're bad, but -.-
2013-05-05 06:58:52	alphanumb	AMcBain, solution?
2013-05-05 06:59:00	alphanumb	tried float, display:inline
2013-05-05 06:59:02	AMcBain	but what?
2013-05-05 06:59:08	AMcBain	If you know they're bad, why do you keep doing it? :)
2013-05-05 07:00:02	alphanumb	it's going in my sidebar as an ad manager, theres only a little code, so it's fine by me. in fact, if you help me solve this, i'll seperate style/content, hows that?
2013-05-05 07:01:41	alphanumb	so how do I get 125x400's side by side then <br /> followed by the 125x125's side by side?
2013-05-05 07:01:46	AMcBain	That's an empty promise. As soon as it is solved, there's no way for me to verify, and nor I would I care to chase after it. This is more for good practices.
2013-05-05 07:01:52	AMcBain	So you get in the habit of doing it right.
2013-05-05 07:01:57	AMcBain	and no, <br> is never a good idea.
2013-05-05 07:02:02	AMcBain	Unless you're writing poems.

2013-05-05 07:28:42	preaction	Havvy, XSLT is more of a template language. your data is XML. your XSLT can then render your XML as HTML. XML Stylesheet Language Transforms I think is what the acronym means

2013-05-05 07:29:24	AMcBain	The other bit is that I believe with HTML5 embedding SVG and MathML (both more XML oriented) is legal now.
2013-05-05 07:29:32	preaction	well, REST you can still have, but the content negotiation part is optional. you always get XML
2013-05-05 07:29:36	AMcBain	Even if you declared the document as text/html.
2013-05-05 07:29:42	preaction	yeah, that's kinda weird
2013-05-05 07:29:54	preaction	and why invent a new damned standard for that when XML covered it

And it's perfectly fine for the iPad, but when I navigate to a SINGLE post, like http://luzlol.me/bittorrent-sync/ it crashes =(((

2013-05-05 10:29:58	darkmutt	leonvv box-sizing : border-box will make your normal box layout in css work much more logically to be honest only the margin is outside the size
2013-05-05 10:31:06	leonvv	darkmutt: Yeah I just looked it up online, I'm very glad I found it because setting padding to elements to a 100% width is dramatic
2013-05-05 10:31:10	darkmutt	and security updates should be ESPECIALLY important for corporate environments even in browsers and especially in those connected to www
2013-05-05 10:31:57	darkmutt	leonvv i base all my websites on box-sizing:border-box cause it lets me set elements without thinking much about other elements with them and worrying if i set one new one itll screw up my entire lyout

2013-05-05 10:39:09	darkmutt	in my opinion the default box sizing has been built by a completely not logical person, reason? when you say an elements width is 100px and height is 100px then no matter WHAT else you set in that element the size SHOULD STAY 100X100px

2013-05-05 10:40:45	GoSox	ravenzz: i use display: table to make variable width page layouts, so i run into box-sizing issues more often than people who  make fixed with pages
2013-05-05 10:40:47	darkmutt	ravenzz but logic should be the MAIN thing in anything dealing with computers and the default is not logical i would go all for margin sizing if i had that possibility to be honest which i sadly don't
2013-05-05 10:40:48	herbnerder	indeed. I only use it on specific elements, usually when I want some pixel based border on a fluid box.

2013-05-05 10:54:17	GoSox	Mac OS actually saves screen shots as PNGs

2013-05-05 14:11:34	darkmutt	what's w.r.t.?? though most likely it is
2013-05-05 14:11:50	AMcBain	With respect to.
2013-05-05 14:12:18	darkmutt	uhum thanks :) Guddu the easiest answer would most likely be making table out of that form or part of it
2013-05-05 14:12:36	Guddu	darkmutt, AMcBain With respect to each other
2013-05-05 14:12:42	darkmutt	but i guess you could for example float inputs to right and text to left
2013-05-05 14:13:06	Guddu	darkmutt, Thanks...actually i was using a table until now but I have been told not to use tables for form layouts. Its not a good practise

2013-05-05 14:13:12	AMcBain	Guddu, easiest thing is to make the labels inline-block, give them all the same fixed width that's at least as large as the largest label, then using text-align.
2013-05-05 14:13:54	darkmutt	that should work too or floating them xD
2013-05-05 14:13:55	Guddu	darkmutt, I want the lable and fields to be horizontallly in centre of containing DIV and labels and input fields with same margin so tht it looks neat. So far I have only been able to achieve centre aligned....
2013-05-05 14:14:21	darkmutt	then do as AMcBain suggested that should work
2013-05-05 14:14:36	AMcBain	Floating them wouldn't do that. Would end up same as before.
2013-05-05 14:14:41	AMcBain	Except with floated elements.
2013-05-05 14:14:45	Guddu	AMcBain, IS there a way to say that the label should have only half the width of the containing DIV?

2013-05-05 14:15:18	darkmutt	not nesessarily if he made the input elements of a fixed width Guddu ugh i hate that nece blahblah word i ALWAYS get it wrong XD
2013-05-05 14:15:45	AMcBain	Guddu, sure, you could make them width: 50%; if they were inline-block, but that won't line them up like you think it will.
2013-05-05 14:16:24	AMcBain	Which is interesting ... because it shouldn't be doing what I'm seeing with your fiddle doing that.
2013-05-05 14:16:36	Guddu	AMcBain, Width of each should be 50% of containing DIV and within that Width I Can say left aligned ?
2013-05-05 14:16:51	Guddu	I am confused
2013-05-05 14:17:36	AMcBain	http://jsfiddle.net/4YAGz/9/
2013-05-05 14:17:41	AMcBain	I added my styles to the end.
2013-05-05 14:18:16	AMcBain	but you don't need to do it that way ... you could remove the block that left aligns (just before the label block) and set the label width to 125px. Would have about the same effect.
2013-05-05 14:18:35	AMcBain	darkmutt, did you figure out your reverse curves problem>
2013-05-05 14:18:41	AMcBain	s/>/?/
2013-05-05 14:19:06	Guddu	Thanks AMcBain This is what i was struggling with for a long time now :)
2013-05-05 14:19:45	darkmutt	actually with the suggestion of using :after and :before i did i didn't even think of those before cause i didn't even remember they existed for how rarely i use them xD
2013-05-05 14:21:48	AMcBain	Yes, but that's an empty response. It doesn't tell me if you actually figured out how to achieve what you wanted or not.

2013-05-05 14:23:16	Guddu	AMcBain, Yes. Now I am reading the changes u made and experimenting with them to understand this better.
2013-05-05 14:23:40	AMcBain	Well, that statement was aimed at darkmutt, but whatever.
2013-05-05 14:24:58	darkmutt	now it'll be easy to achieve or kinda cause i will have to make the border go around the after element and make it overlay the rest of it so should be simple enough, i was just wondering if it's possible before wasn't really interested in doing it yet at that point
2013-05-05 14:26:27	AMcBain	The way I thought about it, the trick is really doing that on the button element, not the box it appears to be.
2013-05-05 14:27:16	darkmutt	yep either would have worked i think
2013-05-05 14:27:50	AMcBain	In theory, but it gets more complicated doing it on the box it appears to be. As you only have two pseudo-elements, and 3 corners.
2013-05-05 14:28:02	AMcBain	So one corner has to be that of the button's parent.

2013-05-05 14:28:32	AMcBain	If you do it on the button, the button can be wrapped (as mentioned, some sort of parent) allowing you to use the parent's top left corner + the two pseudo-elements.
2013-05-05 14:29:00	AMcBain	Which also has the benefit that if you don't supply such a button/div wrapper thing, the original box looks normal.

2013-05-05 18:54:44	rockhardrooster	So... my short CSS code at http://pastebin.com/M43xSX0c doesn't behave like I except it to. I want to style a:link and a:visited, but I want it differently styled for the link of the page you're already on. But even though I think it has higher specificity, it doesn't override the first styling. What am I doing wrong?
2013-05-05 18:55:35	darkmutt	you can put in an !important to each property in that specifity, should overwrite everything rockhardrooster ]

2013-05-05 19:25:40	alphanum	i'm completely lost. i tried getting help yesterday about the same problem, but it's beyond my skill set--though all i need is guidence to fix it myself. the problem lies in one of my stubborn yet very beefy navigation lists on the navigation bar near the upper part of my site. the column is very long. the idea is to have every 10 <li>'s wrap back up to the top, aligning every new div's margin-top
2013-05-05 19:25:40	alphanum	with baseline so that it will look fluid and straight. I absolutely tried wrapping it many ways, but didn't know how to start. at first, I thought it was best doing it server side but upon looking in header.php, it looks like a single function is used to output the nav bar; i have therefore come to the conclusion that I should use a css-only solution. I know there is a cross browser solution for
2013-05-05 19:25:40	alphanum	this problem, and I need your help. pm or post here for live link & thanks for looking.

If into the CSS, how?

2013-05-06 01:40:26	AMcBain	The latter can be done with position: fixed;. It will stay static relative to the viewport. The former requires the idea of a "full height" layout.

2013-05-06 01:49:31	AMcBain	I have a small HTML5-based app for being a mini data-displaying app and stream player for a website. If I minify the entire thing, CSS and JS, it comes out to about or less than jquery, minified.

2013-05-06 01:58:17	AMcBain	Right, and to TheEternalAbyss's note, if you can do it cleanly in HTML/CSS by itself, do it. Don't involve JavaScript unless yo uhave to.

2013-05-06 02:03:52	TheEternalAbyss	though using z-index does remove those block elements from their natural flow

2013-05-06 02:04:37	reisio	AMcBain: to draw looks, I'm guessing
2013-05-06 02:04:47	Ultraviolence	so if you set something to z-index: 1; that makes it the header? or index: 1; for that div

2013-05-06 14:49:03	BorjaGVO	Hi all. I'm trying to follow an example (http://www.onextrapixel.com/2011/06/03/how-to-create-a-horizontal-dropdown-menu-with-html-css-and-jquery/) for creating menus. However, when I try it on IE9 it doesn't work as expected. I read some of the issues people had but not sure how to fix it. This is what I exactly have in source: HTML: http://pastebin.com/LRVV2SSP ; CSS:http://pastebin.com/db6WpHKX. I appreciate any help :-) Thanks!
