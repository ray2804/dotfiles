    Filter Lines is now installed
    -----------------------------

    Now you can filter your file for lines that contain a string
    or match a regular expression

    To filter your file to lines that contain a string or match a regex:

      Edit > Line > Filter To Lines Containing String...  (ctrl + shift + F)
      Edit > Line > Filter To Lines Matching Regex...  (ctrl + option + shift + F)

    To fold your file to lines that contain a string or match a regex:

      Edit > Code Folding > Fold To Lines Containing String...
      Edit > Code Folding > Fold To Lines Matching Regex...

    On Windows and Linux, use the alt key instead of the option key.
