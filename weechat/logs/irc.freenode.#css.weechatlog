2013-04-23 20:49:39	jParkton	I can understand to an extent but when someone corrects English it should not be simply "Haha you say wrong, you dumb foreigner" it should be more for clarity, ask questions don't just point and laugh

2013-04-23 21:04:06	GarethAdams	the key to tabular data is that every item in a column, and every item in a row, are related in some way
2013-04-23 21:04:11	Qbix1	tables for layout is one thing. But why do people go out of their way to use divs and li's for things that clearly have several fields?

2013-04-23 22:48:30	GarethAdams	ultra-: "is it a problem"? Well, IE6 still doesn't support it, but statcounter reports that less than 0.3% of global browsers are IE6
2013-04-23 22:49:02	ultra-	sorry, what i meant was does IE support it now
2013-04-23 22:49:07	GarethAdams	ultra-: whether that matters to you depends on whether your user are likely to have a higher percentage than that (maybe you're developing for a company that thinks it can't afford to upgrade)
