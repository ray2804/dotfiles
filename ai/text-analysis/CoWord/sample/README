    Type of answer:  Selection from the following values:

The data was reformatted to eliminate spaces, shorten the labels and
replaced No Opinions, Don't Knows and Nop App with ?.  The resulting
data set that will be used for this example is in file
SampleDataSet.csv.  The original dataset is in file
SampleDataSetOriginal.csv.  

The file data.keywords contains the keywords generated by the 
dbase-to-keyword.pl program and it is what is fed into the CoWord
tool.

The file results.run1.README list the graphs generated and the
centrality and density of each network.  In this example, there are
11 networks generated and a quick inspection of graph number 1 shows
that:

   Density=0.6812449991703033
   Centrality=1.6383186614385985

   This is a Principal Network (as defined in the documentation) and
   shows that there is a strong network of users that have the following
   characteristics:
 
      - Think that Privacy is more important than convenience
      - Strongly agree that communications should be private
      - Strongly disagree on mass mailings
      - Strongly agree on the value of anonymity
      - Strongly agree that users should control their demographic information
      - Think that Internet Shopping and Banking makes life easier
      - Are willing to use a Credit Card on the Web

   The correlations are very strong (look at the number of co-occurrences in each
   of the nodes) and represent a group that we may call Internet Shopper.  You
   can draw your own conclusions from this and the rest of the graphs.
