(comment "
  Each Platonic solid can therefore be denoted by a symbol {p, q} where
  p = the number of edges of each face (or the number of vertices of each face) and
  q = the number of faces meeting at each vertex (or the number of edges meeting at each vertex).

  The symbol {p, q}, called the Schl√§fli symbol, gives a combinatorial description of the polyhedron.

  All other combinatorial information about these solids, such as total number of
  vertices (V), edges (E), and faces (F), can be determined from p and q.

  Two relationships:
  pF = 2E = qV
  Euler: V - E + F =2
