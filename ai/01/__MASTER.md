Accordingly, we can argue that the "modern English" is not equivalent to the very big set of word sequences in our imaginary corpus. Speakers of English can make judgements about these sequences, and will reject some of them as being ungrammatical.

Equally, it is easy to compose a new sentence and have speakers agree that it is perfectly good English. For example, **sentences have an interesting property that they can be embedded inside larger sentences**. Consider the following sentences:

Usain Bolt broke the 100m record
**The Jamaica Observer -reported that- ** Usain Bolt broke the 100m record
*Andre said* **The Jamaica Observer reported that** Usain Bolt broke the 100m record
`I think` *Andre said* **the Jamaica Observer reported that** Usain Bolt broke the 100m record

If we replaced whole sentences with the symbol `S`, we would see patterns like **Andre said** `S` and **I think** `S`. These are templates for taking a sentence and constructing a bigger sentence.

There are other templates we can use, **like** `S` **but** `S`, **and** `S` **when** `S` **that** `S`.

> With a bit of ingenuity we can construct some really long sentences using these {templates}.

Here's an impressive example from a Winnie the Pooh story by A.A. Milne, In which Piglet is Entirely Surrounded by Water:

[You can imagine `Piglet`'s joy when at last the ship came in sight of `him`.] In after-years `he` liked to think that `he` had been in Very Great Danger during the Terrible Flood, ***but*** the only danger `he` had really been in was the last half-hour of his imprisonment, ***when*** ``Owl``, who had just flown up, sat on a branch of his tree to comfort `him`, and told `him` a very long story about `| an aunt` `who` had once laid a seagull's egg by mistake, ***and*** `the story` went on and on, rather like `this sentence`, ***until*** `Piglet` who was listening out of `his (possessive)` window without much hope, went to sleep quietly and naturally, slipping slowly out of the window towards the water ***until*** he was only hanging on by his toes, at which moment, luckily, a sudden loud squawk from Owl, which was really part of the story, being what his aunt said, woke the Piglet up and just gave him time to jerk himself back into safety and say, "How interesting, and did she?" **when â€” well**, you can imagine his joy **when** at last he saw the good ship, Brain of Pooh (Captain, C. Robin; 1st Mate, P. Bear) coming over the sea to rescue him...

> Proof I wrote that this goes for Dutch as well...

[Je kunt je Biggetjes vreugde voorstellen wanneer eindelijk het schip in zijn zicht kwam.]
In latere-jaren dacht hij graag dat hij in Zeer Groot Gevaar verkeerde gedurende de Vreselijke Vloed, ***maar*** het enige gevaar waar hij echt in verkeerde was het laatste halfuur van zijn gevangenschap, ***toen*** Uil, die net opgevlogen was, neerstreek op een tak van zijn boom om hem te troosten, en hem een lang verhaal vertelde over een tante die ooit eens een zeemeeuw's ei perongeluk, `en` het verhaal ging maar door en door, net zoals deze zin, totdat Biggetje, die uit zijn raam aan het luisteren was zonder veel hoop, stilletjes naar bed ging en natuurlijk, langzaam uit het raam gleed richting het water totdat hij alleen nog maar aan zijn tenen hing, op welk moment, gelukkig, een luide "OUI" van Uil, die eigenlijk onderdeel van het verhaal was, d.w.z. wat zijn tante vertelde, Biggetje wakker maakt en hem net genoeg tijd gaf om zichzelf terug in veiligheid te rukken en zei "Hoe interessant, en deed ze dat?" toen - nou ja, je kan je zijn plezier voorstellen toen eindelijk het goede schip, Brian van Pooh (Captain C. Robin; 1st Mate, P. Bear) over de zee aankwam om hem te redden.

This long sentence actually has a simple structure that begins:

`S` **but** `S` **when** `S`
`Z` **maar** `S` **toen** `S`


We can see from this example that ***language provides us with constructions*** which seem to allow us to *extend sentences indefinitely*.

It is also striking that we can **understand** *sentences of arbitrary length* that we've never heard before: ***it's not hard to concoct an entirely novel sentence***, one that has probably never been used before in the history of the language, ***yet all speakers of the language will understand it***.

The purpose of a grammar is to give an explicit description of a language. But the way in which we think of a grammar is closely intertwined with what we consider to be a language. Is it a large but finite set of observed utterances and written texts? Is it something more abstract like the implicit knowledge that competent speakers have about grammatical sentences? Or is it some combination of the two? We won't take a stand on this issue, but instead will introduce the main approaches.
