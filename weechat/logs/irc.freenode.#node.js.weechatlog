2013-08-31 13:00:07	augustl	all I need is to be able to create a queue, publish messages to it, and have all listeners to that queue get those messages. Could just write one myself ;)

2013-08-31 13:06:37	RLa	augustl, what about eventemitter?
2013-08-31 13:06:53	RLa	or do you need a persistent queue?
2013-08-31 13:07:14	augustl	RLa: I guess I could use an event emitter with just one event, yeah
2013-08-31 13:07:17	aortmann	any Idea why I get on my zabbix server "Received value [C:\Development\private\aortmann\check-receive-folder\index.js:19	 var filesCreatedDate = new Date(stats.ctime)" and on my own computer I can easy run this?
2013-08-31 13:07:18	augustl	no need for being persistent
2013-08-31 13:07:39	RLa	btw, if you have large messages you should move them into gc-less env
2013-08-31 13:07:54	RLa	or rather lots of messages
2013-08-31 13:07:58	augustl	they're not large, they're mostly just various FYIs and heartbeats
2013-08-31 13:08:14	Industrial	Anyone have experience with levelgraph and levelgraph-n3? I'm getting a OpenError: IO error: /Users/tomwieland/Documents/Personal/levelgraph-test/servers/http-server/databases/n3/test/LOCK: No such file or directory but tht db isn't even created yet. the lib is supposed to create the lock file etc.
2013-08-31 13:08:23	augustl	RLa: going down into C++ is the only way to get gc-less I guess
2013-08-31 13:08:24	augustl	?
2013-08-31 13:08:35	RLa	augustl, or external service
2013-08-31 13:08:51	RLa	i think same applies for caching

2013-08-31 16:14:00	Lope	Industrial: yes I've played around with the recommended cluster setup.
2013-08-31 16:14:30	Lope	It works perfectly. I was just thinking perhaps I should use a load balancer and run each worker on a separate port.

2013-08-31 16:15:27	Lope	But upon further contemplation I realized node is not designed for heavy computation, the computation is supposed to happen elsewhere, and node is supposed to be non-blocking. So I doubt any advanced load balancing is necessary.

2013-08-31 16:17:05	Industrial	seaport returns all matching services for a name, so I could do load balancing that way, but I could also just spawn workers in the service. I'm not sure either.

2013-09-02 15:20:24	kenansulayman	What you could do, if you like the Heroku platform — I'm the maintainer of uberlevel (lmdb+levelup). It's backing FineDB & a fork of Redis. You could host the db on an instance and deploy over Heroku
2013-09-02 15:20:45	deathmtn	Up until now, I've just developed locally and then pushed to Heroku and not given any other thought to deployment.
2013-09-02 15:21:23	kenansulayman	You should weight off the best options for your case. Instances can be really expensive. Also you should check if LevelDB applies best to your case

2013-09-02 16:21:17	Industrial	I'm not really sure I understand how single page app routing works on the server. Basically all I have to expose on my server is a route to '/' that rewrites the url to '/index.html' so it gets picked up by the static server, and all the other routes are static routes.
