2013-08-30 22:41:26	dwcook	guideX, not sure what this has to do with being able to use asynchronous functions or not.
2013-08-30 22:41:41	dwcook	Ideally, your server-side structure shouldn't affect that.
2013-08-30 22:41:59	guideX	well in this case, i cannot use an async function, because they simply are not compatible with the updatepanel..
2013-08-30 22:42:14	dwcook	That's a little hard to believe.
2013-08-30 22:42:28	dwcook	Is it that the function expects an immediate result for something?

2013-08-30 22:43:09	guideX	well basically, there's a bunch of objects created at the end of the update panels stuff, and I need to use a jquery library when they're created
2013-08-30 22:43:26	dwcook	Much of the jQuery API is asynchronous.

2013-08-30 22:43:35	guideX	an update panel is basically an asp.net tag , everything between the tag is partial postbacks

2013-08-30 22:48:15	guideX	it's more why doesn't settimeout block the do loop
2013-08-30 22:48:22	guideX	or how do I block the do loop?
2013-08-30 22:48:35	Sorella	guideX, what are you trying to do? Forget all about the "I can't use asynchronous" part, just say what you want to do with the contents of the updatepanel
2013-08-30 22:48:36	yeboot	make it a while loop?
2013-08-30 22:49:13	guideX	oh I'm trying to find all of .shippingOptions .shippingOption tags, and do something with them
2013-08-30 22:49:17	dwcook	guideX, it's because calling setTimeout only means to throw the function in a queue of things that will be executed later. They can't start executing as long as something else is already on the stack though.
2013-08-30 22:49:39	dwcook	guideX, you don't block the do loop. You factor it out into recursion within the timeouts.

2013-08-30 22:57:58	dwcook	guideX, if you think it looks terrible, you could abstract it out into a higher-order function that looks less terrible when you call it.

2013-08-30 22:58:23	dwcook	For that matter, a promises library could make this pretty, I believe.

2013-08-31 07:50:57	Maxdamantus	So they get to refer to jQuery with $ and get to declare all their variables without infecting the global object.

2013-09-02 02:00:03	Sorella	ezakimak, optimisation is tricky at the library level, specially dealing with GC. In a language like Elm, you can optimise on the static guarantees.
2013-09-02 02:00:24	ezakimak	would be great for data visualization though
2013-09-02 02:00:34	Sorella	Microsoft implements such concept with Observables, which kind of gives you this property, but has lots of drawbacks.

2013-09-02 02:38:49	Sorella	substack, FRP is actually pretty simple. You have a signal that captures discrete or continuous values over time. And you create new signals by transforming old signals. Events are signals, so you can abstract over them and compose them. By the end of the day, you have cleanly separated your stuff and has something that is big, yet not complected :)
2013-09-02 02:38:50	garbagecollectio	basically you are just splitting the input in half and doing the binary search on a smaller input in two threads simultaneously

2013-09-02 03:46:48	Sorella	yogurt_truck, because you want foo(a); to choose the correct implementation of `foo` depending on `a`.

2013-09-02 03:46:59	MJCD	what does 'pure' even mean?
2013-09-02 03:47:01	sykopomp	I'm pretty sure you have no idea how something like var foo = function() {}, or how method definitions in "regular" javascript work if you think they're "pure" somehow.

2013-09-02 03:47:50	Sorella	yogurt_truck, you could make addMethod() return a new genFun with a new branch, but that wouldn't help previous usage of the genfun, which would totally miss the point of this.

2013-09-02 03:48:20	yogurt_truck	MJCD: pure is a function that maps from a domain to a codomain. sykopomp is just pretending i'm saying "wild shit", but he's just defending his design choice, which is ok.

2013-09-02 04:13:49	Sorella	sykopomp, there might be no "more specific" method though. In Clojure it actually makes sense because all functions have the same specificity, but that's a "problem" with predicate dispatch

2013-09-02 05:08:07	Sorella	sykopomp, theoretically, the premises of a function are functions from A → Bool. The first branch whose all premises return True for all inputs win, and is invoked. You can have optimisations in certain cases, but if you allow the predicate to be just about any function, then it's almost impossible to optimise.

2013-09-02 05:16:43	Sorella	But with full predicate dispatching, you have no idea of how you "weight" cases. For example, if I define: `(def-method add [is-number? is-number?] (a b) (+ a b))` and `(def-method add [is-int? is-int?] (a b) (+ a b))`, and call `(add 1 2)`, which method should be "more specific"?
2013-09-02 05:17:25	Sorella	If you have a Number class and an Int class, you can extract the hierarchy and use that to define the specificity, but in this case you don't have such hierarchy
2013-09-02 05:18:52	sykopomp	Sorella: you can implement genfun's dispatch over polygamous, though.

2013-09-02 05:19:56	Sorella	sykopomp, well, your dispatch function would need to know about the cases defined for a particular multimethod.
2013-09-02 05:20:24	sykopomp	Sorella: yeah basically.
2013-09-02 05:20:41	sykopomp	Sorella: but in the case of genfun, you'd need the genfun to do that work anyway, so it's kinda irrelevant.
2013-09-02 05:20:42	Sorella	Most of my multi-methods are basically function (a) { return someTagFor(a) }
2013-09-02 05:20:52	sykopomp	methods aren't stored inside the genfun. The genfun actually can't give you a list of all methods defined.

2013-09-02 08:20:08	Shirakawasuna	lite_: too vague to know for sure, but like I said... you use IDs as IDs. Not classes or groups.
2013-09-02 08:20:26	Agamemnus	all this blurring between the DOM and pure Javascript is bad

2013-09-02 08:22:31	Agamemnus	that's the downfall of IDs

2013-09-02 08:23:21	Agamemnus	i guess it's the same reason why using too many globals is bad
2013-09-02 08:23:27	yogurt_truck	lite_: it is not inherently wrong to use IDs. if they really express that the element is unique, and you want to also, say, be able to link to the element with URL fragments, go ahead
2013-09-02 08:23:41	Agamemnus	...especially if you are making a plugin
2013-09-02 08:23:45	sykopomp	on a side note about IDs
2013-09-02 08:23:57	sykopomp	I'm really excited that web components will actually give me a reason to use them a lot.
2013-09-02 08:24:07	Agamemnus	hmm
2013-09-02 08:24:11	Agamemnus	what do you mean?
2013-09-02 08:24:14	sykopomp	custom elements scope their templates' ids to the template itself.
2013-09-02 08:24:30	sykopomp	so if you have <div id=mything> inside your template, that doesn't escape outside of its scope.
2013-09-02 08:24:37	lite_	the only thing this id will be used for is to allow jbehave to select the element. (eg. selenium.click("css=#labelinput") )
2013-09-02 08:24:37	Agamemnus	isn't that just kind of like a class then?
2013-09-02 08:24:54	sykopomp	but your internal javascript (and CSS) for the template can see the id.
2013-09-02 08:25:01	--	psgs is now known as psgs|Work
2013-09-02 08:25:12	sykopomp	Agamemnus: they're still unique, within the template.
2013-09-02 08:25:18	yogurt_truck	an ID is never anything like a class, (except the "class" that has only one member)
2013-09-02 08:25:20	sykopomp	and you can do getElementById on them.
2013-09-02 08:25:48	sykopomp	I assume you get the speed benefits from them, too, not just the expressive benefits.
2013-09-02 08:26:03	sykopomp	and actually there's another really nice thing about it.
2013-09-02 08:26:07	yogurt_truck	that too
2013-09-02 08:26:22	sykopomp	you don't have to struggle between wrapping your inputs in <label>
2013-09-02 08:26:35	sykopomp	you can actually use IDs with your form fields, and <label for=...>
2013-09-02 08:26:42	sykopomp	and you don't have to worry about scoping issues.
2013-09-02 08:26:52	sykopomp	this is probably the part I'm most excited about.

2013-09-02 08:55:17	yogurt_truck	they're all modules. but yeah. some core graphic modules get automatically imported
2013-09-02 08:55:19	sykopomp	yes, but you need Elm programmers to change how something looks :\

2013-09-02 08:56:25	sykopomp	I think there's a line when it comes to things like stylus/haml/etc (not that I like haml that much), but they're really just syntactic/convenience abstractions over the core html/css, so html/css people can still handle it.
2013-09-02 08:56:51	yogurt_truck	sykopomp: that's only bad for familiarity reasons. because you can definitely (like i'm doing with my shmup game atm) have a totally separate display file with only display-specific definitions (colors, gradients, sizes, positions. all of which are in addition, obviously, waaay easier and more terse to do in Elm than in stupid CSS)
2013-09-02 08:57:00	yogurt_truck	bu tyeah

Can anyone help me understanding this code? http://pastebin.com/gf206Cp0. for once, I dont understand what the BigInteger does. i dont find any js file where its defined. But neither can i find a known standard BigInteger() function via googe. does it limit the integer value to 16 chars? or is it a hex/ base 16 thing?

2013-09-03 19:18:56	bberry_	Hey guys, is this a good way to do this? http://jsfiddle.net/5MgQk/ all im doing is sending .sh script commands to my server and having the text be returned to me and put into the <textarea>

2013-09-03 19:20:15	sykopomp	day: BigIntegers are meant to be heap-allocated numbers, so you can basically have virtually-unbounded integers. Regular JavaScript "integers" are actually floats that only go up to a certain size.

2013-09-03 19:21:49	day	sykopomp: i thought so/ read that. But why the 16? what does it do? it would be stupid to limit the publickey_mod which is like 200+ long to 16 :/

2013-09-03 19:22:18	sykopomp	day: the 16 is the radix to parse the integer with.

2013-09-03 19:22:36	sykopomp	so you can do new BigInteger("bebebe", 16), I figure.
2013-09-03 19:22:44	sykopomp	kinda like parseInt
