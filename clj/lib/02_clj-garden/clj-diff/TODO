nuetral return format?
context can be handled by the caller i think
port the implementation and tests from java to clojure, to remove the dependency
and increase future flexability.
note also: http://www.bmsi.com/java/#diff
note corner case of add or del start = 0
diffing things other than strings??


Line x:        Line y:
Upper Context  Upper Context
(blank         Green added)
(Red del       blank)
(Red del       Green added)
Lower Context  Lower Conext

(diff* '("a" "b" "c" "d" "e") '("a'" "b" "c" "c'" "d"))
{:del-start 0, :del-end 0,   :add-start 0, :add-end 0}
{:del-start 3, :del-end nil, :add-start 3, :add-end 3}
{:del-start 4, :del-end 4,   :add-start 5, :add-end nil}

[0 0 0 0]
[3 nil 3 3]
[4 4 5 nil]

{:change   {:old-start 0 :old-end 0 :new-start 0 :new-end 0}} (direct)
{:addition {:old-start 3 :new-start 3 :new-end 3}}
{:deletion {:old-start 4 :old-end 4 :new-start 5}}
