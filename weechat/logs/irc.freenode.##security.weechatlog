2013-06-10 22:13:10	supersym	my /dev/console shows a date 44 years back... I guess thats not good huh?
2013-06-10 22:13:10	TheFlipside	faking mac addresses and ip addresses are two pair of shoes
2013-06-10 22:13:46	patn	assuming: A and B is communicating with each other
2013-06-10 22:13:46	caution	my real question is does the ARP cache always override the source MAC of other packets in two way communcation
2013-06-10 22:13:49	supersym	goes for most /dev files really
2013-06-10 22:14:04	Apachez	I think it depends on the tcp stack being used
2013-06-10 22:14:15	Apachez	some will always overwrite the current cache with latest mac seen
2013-06-10 22:14:15	TheFlipside	it also depends on the switch
2013-06-10 22:14:28	Apachez	some only accept the first mac and wont update until the ttl goes down to 0
2013-06-10 22:14:38	patn	caution, it depends on implementation
2013-06-10 22:14:45	patn	and arp poisoning
2013-06-10 22:14:49	Apachez	some is also breaking rfc by accepting new mac through the srcmac in the ip packets
2013-06-10 22:14:54	patn	when you poison the arp caches of A and B
2013-06-10 22:15:00	patn	such that you are MITM

2013-06-10 22:15:10	patn	then A and B never communicate directly
2013-06-10 22:15:18	Apachez	another way is to overflow the arpcache so the switch becomes a hub
2013-06-10 22:15:22	patn	and thus cannot "restore" their arp caches correctly
2013-06-10 22:15:37	caution	I'm not talking about the actual MITM, just the affect one ARP packet has on communication
2013-06-10 22:15:41	TheFlipside	arp overflow is a higher level attack than just spoofing
2013-06-10 22:15:44	patn	ah okay
2013-06-10 22:15:54	Apachez	higher?
2013-06-10 22:16:09	TheFlipside	do you prefer "different"?

2013-06-10 22:17:14	patn	the stack i implemented on a xilinx vertex simply took the last occuring MAC-IP mapping

The problem is that it shouldn't have happened in the first place, and then our government lied about the existance and breadth of such spying efforts.

2013-06-11 03:26:09	wifioregon	Is the following method a pretty decent form of encryption?  openssl des3 -salt -in file.txt -out encryptedfile.txt  (using a very, very strong and robust password), and then putting the encrypted text file in an encrypted zip file with a 16 character password.   Its for my main password list, which I then attach the zip in an email and send to myself.

2013-06-11 03:50:23	@jnpplf	keepass is free, I think
2013-06-11 03:50:25	sartan	where are you anticipating extracting this password dump on

2013-06-11 03:50:49	@jnpplf	The keychain doth kinda suck. No idea how the storage is implemented though.
2013-06-11 03:50:54	wifioregon	lunaphyte:  ehh well my time machine hard drive (which is encrypted) is backing it up supposedly

2013-06-11 03:51:44	sartan	it's got this neat ssl validationf eature and a password server, if the file leaves the network, it's not getting decrypted.

2013-06-11 03:54:59	lunaphyte	it's mostly just an affinity that's sort of blossomed over the years, due to direct personal experiences with free/open source software being simply better in varying capacities than commercial alternatives.

2013-06-11 05:09:02	cao_	sartan: timing there is much more of an issue
2013-06-11 05:09:10	cao_	and of course owning the hypervisor
2013-06-11 05:09:16	MrPockets	really, SirCmpwn, if you're worried about top secret Emails
2013-06-11 05:09:17	sartan	there were a few xen attacks a while back
2013-06-11 05:09:24	MrPockets	run it with PGP
2013-06-11 05:09:30	sartan	i don't have anything to hide i just don't want anyone there
2013-06-11 05:09:35	MrPockets	then remove the shit form the mail db and store it in a seperate truecrypt container
2013-06-11 05:09:38	cao_	if you are worried about top secret emails, use different machines
2013-06-11 05:09:48	SirCmpwn	yeah, this would all be in addition to PGP
2013-06-11 05:10:12	cao_	fetch emails from an internet-facing service
2013-06-11 05:10:28	cao_	encrypted backups via different channels
2013-06-11 05:10:37	karstensrage	do any of you use pgp email?
2013-06-11 05:11:07	karstensrage	how do you deal with the private key, do you copy it to all your machines/devices?
2013-06-11 05:11:07	cao_	karstensrage: most of my mails are gpg, at least signed
2013-06-11 05:11:07	SirCmpwn	karstensrage: I do, for some emails
2013-06-11 05:11:07	SirCmpwn	I keep my key encrypted on a flash drive
2013-06-11 05:11:09	SirCmpwn	well, some of them
2013-06-11 05:11:10	karstensrage	and carry it around?
2013-06-11 05:11:18	cao_	karstensrage: subkeys that are signed
2013-06-11 05:11:25	karstensrage	?
2013-06-11 05:11:36	karstensrage	cao_, huh?
2013-06-11 05:11:40	SirCmpwn	I keep copies of the keys on computers that use them
2013-06-11 05:11:48	SirCmpwn	the flash drive in question is sitting in a locked box in my closet
2013-06-11 05:11:56	SirCmpwn	along with a few paper wallets and such
2013-06-11 05:12:15	cao_	karstensrage: you can have multiple subkeys for one master key
2013-06-11 05:12:27	karstensrage	hm how?
2013-06-11 05:12:30	cao_	e.g. one for the workstation at work, one for the notebook, one for the private one 
2013-06-11 05:12:32	karstensrage	with gpg?
2013-06-11 05:12:43	cao_	yes
