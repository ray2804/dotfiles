However, if i have that as a MatchObject, and do groups(), it will return a tuple containing all (so, A empty, B filled, C empty).

2013-04-23 14:14:06	cwillu_at_work	talin, my preference would be to use one regex to find the addresses, and then regular splitting to extract

2013-04-23 14:14:18	jorrit	Seno, i.e. never ask to ask. Just ask the question directly.

2013-04-23 14:15:46	cwillu_at_work	talin, . doesn't match \n by default, although that can be changed, but you don't actually need that here anyway

2013-04-23 14:16:30	talin	cwillu_at_work: hmm, though it says ". In the default mode, this matches any character except newline."
2013-04-23 14:16:33	hiptobecubic	dav, well first of all, you should use setattr() to do something like this instead of underscored methods of self, i should think
2013-04-23 14:16:35	laen	jorrit: well, that's fine, but i see at least 6 people answering regeex questions that _should_ be on a pastebin, and i pastebin and get nothing ;p
2013-04-23 14:16:37	jorrit	Seno, btw, the '9' you pass to your Lottery function will be overwritten.
2013-04-23 14:16:45	cwillu_at_work	uncaffeinated cwillu is hardly a cwillu at all!
2013-04-23 14:16:53	jorrit	Seno, because on line 5 you give it a new value. So the 9 is gone after that.

Atm I somehow need to "revert" that hex byte to the original characters in korean, is tha

2013-04-23 18:28:12	mSSM	I have a little python script which (naively) prints simulation results after every step, line by line. Now, when I simply “$ python myscript.py”, it gives me the results right away. However, when I redirect the output of that to a file (or to tee, which I want to print to the file and to stdout), it prints only after the entire script exits. Can I somehow have python send the print results to stdout
2013-04-23 18:28:14	mSSM	before the script finishes running?

2013-04-23 18:29:28	sst66	Perfect, dash, thanks!
2013-04-23 18:29:30	therealfakemoot	mSSM: Have you considered outright file logging?
2013-04-23 18:29:32	mSSM	cdunklau: thanks, I will look at that function's doc.
2013-04-23 18:29:34	tullyvey_	mSSM: might be overkill, but you can change the print statements to use logging, then add file and stdout handlers
2013-04-23 18:29:40	therealfakemoot	mSSM: With the standard library's logger
2013-04-23 18:30:17	mSSM	therealfakemoot: Seems like overkill... I want to have a look at the results right away. One simulation step takes 10 minutes or more, and I want to see it on my terminal right away,.
2013-04-23 18:30:18	ManoloMtnez	I many times do a = function(randomstuff); while not test(a): a = function(randomstuff). Is there a right way not to repeat the assignment to a?

2013-04-23 18:30:21	therealfakemoot	mSSM: It lets you pretty flexibily/dynamically configure where log output goes to, and it isn't restrict to one output at once. You can log to stdout, stderr, a file, and to email
2013-04-23 18:30:26	therealfakemoot	mSSM: Just a thought
2013-04-23 18:30:30	mSSM	therealfakemoot: In case I f*cked up the input...
2013-04-23 18:30:47	cdunklau	mSSM: for something that takes minutes, logging is not overkill

2013-04-23 18:32:40	therealfakemoot	mSSM: Using hte logging module does not preclude using stdout/stderr and pipes
2013-04-23 18:32:59	black_13	it seems that when i use sub-processes to create directories if i try to remove the directories i run into permission problems.
2013-04-23 18:33:15	ManoloMtnez	therealfakemoot: this is the relevant bit: http://sprunge.us/BKdC I would like to avoid the two assignments to sender1 and receiver1
