<p>PART II.</p>
<p>ETYMOLOGY.</p>
<p><br>
ETYMOLOGY treats of the different parts of speech, with their classes and modifications.</p>
<p>The <i>Parts of Speech</i> are the several kinds, or principal classes, into which words are divided by grammarians.</p>
<p><i>Classes</i>, under the parts of speech, are the particular sorts into which the several kinds of words are subdivided.</p>
<p><i>Modifications</i> are inflections, or changes, in the terminations, forms, or senses, of some kinds of words.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br>
CHAPTER I.--PARTS OF SPEECH.</p>
<p>The Parts of Speech, or sorts of words, in English, are ten; namely, the Article, the Noun, the Adjective, the Pronoun, the Verb, the Participle, the Adverb, the Conjunction, the Preposition, and the Interjection.</p>
<p>1. THE ARTICLE.</p>
<p>An Article is the word <i>the, an</i>, or <i>a</i>, which we put before nouns to limit their signification: as, <i>The</i> air, <i>the</i> stars; <i>an</i> island, <i>a</i> ship.</p>
<p>2. THE NOUN.</p>
<p>A Noun is the name of any person, place, or thing, that can be known or mentioned: as, <i>George, York, man, apple, truth</i>.</p>
<p>3. THE ADJECTIVE.</p>
<p>An Adjective is a word added to a noun or pronoun, and generally expresses quality: as, A <i>wise</i> man; a <i>new</i> book. You <i>two</i> are <i>diligent</i>.</p>
<p>4. THE PRONOUN.</p>
<p>A Pronoun is a word used in stead of a noun: as, The boy loves <i>his</i> book; <i>he</i> has long lessons, and <i>he</i> learns <i>them</i> well.</p>
<p>5. THE VERB.</p>
<p>A Verb is a word that signifies <i>to be, to act</i>, or <i>to be acted upon</i>: as, I <i>am</i>, I <i>rule</i>, I <i>am ruled</i>; I <i>love</i>, thou <i>lovest</i>, he <i>loves</i>.</p>
<p>6. THE PARTICIPLE.</p>
<p>A Participle is a word derived from a verb, participating the properties of a verb, and of an adjective or a noun; and is generally formed by adding <i>ing, d</i>, or <i>ed</i>, to the verb: thus, from the verb <i>rule</i>, are formed three participles, two simple and one compound; as, 1. <i>ruling</i>, 2. <i>ruled</i>, 3. <i>having ruled</i>.</p>
<p>7. THE ADVERB.</p>
<p>An Adverb is a word added to a verb, a participle, an adjective, or an other adverb; and generally expresses time, place, degree, or manner: as, They are <i>now here</i>, studying <i>very diligently</i>.</p>
<p>8. THE CONJUNCTION.</p>
<p>A Conjunction is a word used to connect words or sentences in construction, and to show the dependence of the terms so connected: as, "Thou <i>and</i> he are happy, <i>because</i> you are good."--<i>L. Murray</i>.</p>
<p>9. THE PREPOSITION.</p>
<p>A Preposition is a word used to express some relation of different things or thoughts to each other, and is generally placed before a noun or a pronoun; as, The paper lies <i>before</i> me <i>on</i> the desk.</p>
<p>10. THE INTERJECTION.</p>
<p>An Interjection is a word that is uttered merely to indicate some strong or sudden emotion of the mind: as, <i>Oh! alas! ah! poh! pshaw! avaunt! aha!</i> hurrah!</p>
<p><br>
OBSERVATIONS.</p>
<p>OBS. 1.--The first thing to be learned in the study of this the second part of grammar, is the distribution of the words of the language into those principal sorts, or classes, which are denominated <i>the Parts of Speech</i>. This is a matter of some difficulty. And as no scheme which can be adopted, will be in all cases so plain that young beginners will not occasionally falter in its application, the teacher may sometimes find it expedient to refer his pupils to the following simple explanations, which are designed to aid their first and most difficult steps.</p>
<p>How can we know to what class, or part of speech, any word belongs? By learning the definitions of the ten parts of speech, and then observing how the word is written, and in what sense it is used. It is necessary also to observe, so far as we can, with what other words each particular one is capable of making sense.</p>
<p>1. Is it easy to distinguish an ARTICLE? If not always easy, it is generally so: <i>the, an</i>, and <i>a</i>, are the only English words called articles, and these are rarely any thing else. Because <i>an</i> and <i>a</i> have the same import, and are supposed to have the same origin, the articles are commonly reckoned two, but some count them as three.</p>
<p>2. How can we distinguish a NOUN? By means of the article before it, if there is one; as, <i>the house, an apple, a book</i>; or, by adding it to the phrase, "<i>I mentioned</i>;" as, "I mentioned <i>peace</i>;"--"I mentioned <i>war</i>;"--"I mentioned <i>slumber</i>." Any word which thus makes complete sense, is, in that sense, a noun; because a noun is the <i>name</i> of any thing which can thus be mentioned <i>by a name</i>. Of English nouns, there are said to be as many as twenty-five or thirty thousand.</p>
<p>3. How can we distinguish an ADJECTIVE? By putting a noun after it, to see if the phrase will be sense. The noun <i>thing</i>, or its plural <i>things</i>, will suit almost any adjective; as, A <i>good</i> thing--A <i>bad</i> thing--A <i>little</i> thing--A <i>great</i> thing--<i>Few</i> things--<i>Many</i> things--<i>Some</i> things--<i>Fifty</i> things. Of adjectives, there are perhaps nine or ten thousand.</p>
<p>4. How can we distinguish a PRONOUN? By observing that its noun repeated makes the same sense. Thus, the example of the pronoun above, "The boy loves <i>his</i> book; <i>he</i> has long lessons, and <i>he</i> learns <i>them</i> well,"--very clearly means, "The boy loves <i>the boy's</i> book; <i>the boy</i> has long lessons, and <i>the boy</i> learns <i>those lessons</i> well." Here then, by a disagreeable repetition of two nouns, we have the same sense without any pronoun; but it is obvious that the pronouns form a better mode of expression, because they prevent this awkward repetition. The different pronouns in English are twenty-four; and their variations in declension are thirty-two: so that the number of <i>words</i> of this class, is fifty-six.</p>
<p>5. How can we distinguish a VERB? By observing that it is usually the principal word in the sentence, and that without it there would be no assertion. It is the word which expresses what is affirmed or said of the person or thing mentioned; as, "Jesus <i>wept</i>."--"Felix <i>trembled</i>."--"The just <i>shall live</i> by faith." It will make sense when inflected with the pronouns; as, I <i>write</i>, thou <i>writ'st</i>, he <i>writes</i>; we <i>write</i>, you <i>write</i>, they <i>write</i>.--I <i>walk</i>, thou <i>walkst</i>, he <i>walks</i>; we <i>walk</i>, you <i>walk</i>, they <i>walk</i>. Of English verbs, some recent grammarians compute the number at eight thousand; others formerly reckoned them to be no more than four thousand three hundred.[131]</p>
<p>6. How can we distinguish a PARTICIPLE? By observing its derivation from the verb, and then placing it after <i>to be</i> or <i>having</i>; as, To be <i>writing</i>, Having <i>written</i>--To be <i>walking</i>, Having <i>walked</i>--To be <i>weeping</i>, Having <i>wept</i>--To be <i>studying</i>, Having <i>studied</i>. Of simple participles, there are twice as many as there are of simple or radical verbs; and the possible compounds are not less numerous than the simples, but they are much less frequently used.</p>
<p>7. How can we distinguish an ADVERB? By observing that it answers to the question, <i>When? Where? How much?</i> or <i>How</i>?--or serves to ask it; as, "He spoke fluently." <i>How</i> did he speak? <i>Fluently</i>. This word <i>fluently</i> is therefore an adverb: it tells <i>how</i> he spoke. Of adverbs, there are about two thousand six hundred; and four fifths of them end in <i>ly</i>.</p>
<p>8. How can we distinguish a CONJUNCTION? By observing what words or terms it joins together, or to what other conjunction it corresponds; as, "<i>Neither</i> wealth <i>nor</i> honor can heal a wounded conscience."--<i>Dillwyn's</i> Ref.<i>, p. 16. Or, it may be well to learn the whole list at once:</i> And, as, both, because, even, for, if, that, then, since, seeing, so: Or, nor, either, neither, than, though, although, yet, but, except, whether, lest, unless, save, provided, notwithstanding, whereas. <i>Of conjunctions, there</i> are these twenty-nine in common use, and a few others now obsolete.</p>
<p>9. How can we distinguish a PREPOSITION? By observing that it will govern the pronoun <i>them</i>, and is not a verb or a participle; as, <i>About</i> them--<i>above</i> them--<i>across</i> them--<i>after</i> them--<i>against</i> them--<i>amidst</i> them--<i>among</i> them--<i>around</i> them--<i>at</i> them--<i>Before</i> them--<i>behind</i> them--<i>below</i> them--<i>beneath</i> them--<i>beside</i> them--<i>between</i> them--<i>beyond</i> them--<i>by</i> them--<i>For</i> them--<i>from</i> them--<i>In</i> them--<i>into</i> them, &amp;c. Of the prepositions, there are about sixty now in common use.</p>
<p>10. How can we distinguish an INTERJECTION? By observing that it is an independent word or sound, uttered earnestly, and very often written with the note of exclamation; as <i>Lo! behold! look! see! hark! hush! hist! mum!</i> Of interjections, there are sixty or seventy in common use, some of which are seldom found in books.</p>
<p>OBS. 2.--An accurate knowledge of words, and of their changes, is indispensable to a clear discernment of their proper combinations in sentences, according to the usage of the learned. Etymology, therefore, should be taught before syntax; but it should be chiefly taught by a direct analysis of entire sentences, and those so plainly written that the particular effect of every word may be clearly distinguished, and the meaning, whether intrinsic or relative, be discovered with precision. The parts of speech are usually named and defined with reference to the use of words <i>in sentences</i>; and, as the same word not unfrequently stands for several different parts of speech, the learner should be early taught to make for himself the proper application of the foregoing distribution, without recurrence to a dictionary, and without aid from his teacher. He who is endeavouring to acquaint himself with the grammar of a language which he can already read and understand, is placed in circumstances very different from those which attend the school-boy who is just beginning to construe some sentences of a foreign tongue. A frequent use of the dictionary may facilitate the progress of the one, while it delays that of the other. English grammar, it is hoped, may be learned directly from this book alone, with better success than can be expected when the attention of the learner is divided among several or many different works.</p>
<p>OBS. 3.--Dr. James P. Wilson, in speaking of the classification of words, observes, "The <i>names</i> of the distributive parts should either express, distinctly, the influence, which each class produces on sentences; or some other characteristic trait, by which the respective species of words may be distinguished, without danger of confusion. It is at least probable, that no distribution, sufficiently minute, can ever be made, of the parts of speech, which shall be wholly free from all objection. Hasty innovations, therefore, and crude conjectures, should not be permitted to disturb that course of grammatical instruction, which has been advancing in melioration, by the unremitting labours of thousands, through a series of ages."--<i>Wilson's Essay on Gram.</i>, p. 66. Again: "The <i>number</i> of the parts of speech may be reduced, or enlarged, at pleasure; and the rules of syntax may be accommodated to such new arrangement. The best grammarians find it difficult, in practice, to distinguish, in some instances, adverbs, prepositions, and conjunctions; yet their effects are generally distinct. This inconvenience should be submitted to, since a less comprehensive distribution would be very unfavourable to a rational investigation of the meaning of English sentences."--<i>Ib.</i>, p. 68. Again: "<i>As</i> and <i>so</i> have been also deemed substitutes, and resolved into other words. But if all abbreviations are to be restored to their primitive parts of speech, there will be a general revolution in the present systems of grammar; and the various improvements, which have sprung from convenience, or necessity, and been sanctioned by the usage of ancient times, must be retrenched, and anarchy in letters universally prevail."--<i>Ib.</i>, p. 114.</p>
<p>OBS. 4.--I have elsewhere sufficiently shown why <i>ten</i> parts of speech are to be preferred to any other number, in English; and whatever diversity of opinion there may be, respecting the class to which some particular words ought to be referred, I trust to make it obvious to good sense, that I have seldom erred from the course which is most expedient. 1. <i>Articles</i> are used with appellative nouns, sometimes to denote emphatically the species, but generally to designate individuals. 2. <i>Nouns</i> stand in discourse for persons, things, or abstract qualities. 3. <i>Adjectives</i> commonly express the concrete qualities of persons or things; but sometimes, their situation or number. 4. <i>Pronouns</i> are substitutes for names, or nouns; but they sometimes represent sentences. 5. <i>Verbs</i> assert, ask, or say something; and, for the most part, express action or motion. 6. <i>Participles</i> contain the essential meaning of their verbs, and commonly denote action, and imply time; but, apart from auxiliaries, they express that meaning either adjectively or substantively, and not with assertion. 7. <i>Adverbs</i> express the circumstances of time, of place, of degree, and of manner; the <i>when</i>, the <i>where</i>, the <i>how much</i>, and the <i>how</i>. 8. <i>Conjunctions</i> connect, sometimes words, and sometimes sentences, rarely phrases; and always show, either the manner in which one sentence or one phrase depends upon an other, or what connexion there is between two words that refer to a third. 9. <i>Prepositions</i> express the correspondent relations of things to things, of thoughts to thoughts, or of words to words; for these, if we speak truly, must be all the same in expression. 10. <i>Interjections</i> are either natural sounds or exclamatory words, used independently, and serving briefly to indicate the wishes or feelings of the speaker.</p>
<p>OBS. 5.--In the following passage, all the parts of speech are exemplified, and each is pointed out by the figure placed over the word:--</p>
<pre> 1    2   9    2    5  1    2      3      9   2   1    2      6
</pre>
<p>"The power of speech is a faculty peculiar to man; a faculty bestowed 9 4 9 4 3 2 9 1 3 8 7 3 on him by his beneficent Creator, for the greatest and most excellent</p>
<pre>2     8    10    7    7    5 4     5    4  9   1   3    9
</pre>
<p>uses; but, alas! how often do we pervert it to the worst of</p>
<pre>  2
</pre>
<p>purposes!"--See <i>Lowth's Gram.</i>, p. 1.</p>
<p>In this sentence, which has been adopted by Murray, Churchill, and others, we have the following parts of speech: 1. The words <i>the, a</i>, and <i>an</i>, are articles. 2. The words <i>power, speech, faculty, man, faculty, Creator,</i> uses<i>, and</i> purposes<i>, are nouns. 3. The words</i> peculiar, beneficent, greatest, excellent<i>, and</i> worst<i>, are adjectives. 4. The words</i> him, his, we<i>, and</i> it<i>, are pronouns. 5. The words</i> is, do<i>, and</i> pervert<i>, are</i> verbs. 6. The word <i>bestowed</i> is a participle. 7. The words <i>most, how</i>, and <i>often</i>, are adverbs. 8. The words <i>and</i> and <i>but</i> are conjunctions. 9. The words <i>of, on, to, by, for, to</i>, and <i>of</i>, are prepositions. 10. The word <i>alas!</i> is an interjection.</p>
<p>OBS. 6.--In speaking or writing, we of course bring together the different parts of speech just as they happen to be needed. Though a sentence of ordinary length usually embraces more than one half of them, it is not often that we find them <i>all</i> in so small a compass. Sentences sometimes abound in words of a particular kind, and are quite destitute of those of some other sort. The following examples will illustrate these remarks. (1) ARTICLES: "<i>A</i> square is less beautiful than <i>a</i> circle; and <i>the</i> reason seems to be, that <i>the</i> attention is divided among <i>the</i> sides and angles of <i>a</i> square, whereas <i>the</i> circumference of <i>a</i> circle, being <i>a</i> single object, makes one entire impression."--<i>Kames, Elements of Criticism</i>, Vol. i, p. 175. (2.) NOUNS: "A <i>number</i> of <i>things</i> destined for the same <i>use</i>, such as <i>windows, chairs, spoons, buttons</i>, cannot be too uniform; for, supposing their <i>figure</i> to be good, <i>utility</i> requires <i>uniformity</i>."--<i>Ib.</i>, i, 176. (3.) ADJECTIVES: "Hence nothing <i>just,</i> proper, decent, beautiful, proportioned<i>, or</i> grand<i>, is</i> <i>risible</i>."--<i>Ib.</i>, i, 229. (4.) PRONOUNS: "<i>I</i> must entreat the courteous reader to suspend <i>his</i> curiosity, and rather to consider <i>what</i> is written than <i>who they</i> are <i>that</i> write it."--<i>Addison, Spect.</i>, No. 556. (5.) VERBS: "The least consideration <i>will inform</i> us how easy it <i>is</i> to <i>put</i> an ill-natured construction upon a word; and what perverse turns and expressions <i>spring</i> from an evil temper. Nothing <i>can be explained</i> to him who <i>will</i> not <i>understand</i>, nor <i>will</i> any thing <i>appear</i> right to the unreasonable."--<i>Cecil</i>. (6.) PARTICIPLES: "The Scriptures are an authoritative voice, <i>reproving, instructing</i>, and <i>warning</i> the world; and <i>declaring</i> the only means <i>ordained</i> and <i>provided for escaping</i> the awful penalties of sin."--<i>G. B.</i> (7.) ADVERBS: "The light of Scripture shines <i>steadily, purely, benignly, certainly, superlatively</i>."--<i>Dr. S. H. Cox.</i> (8.) CONJUNCTIONS: "Quietness and silence <i>both</i> become <i>and</i> befriend religious exercises. Clamour <i>and</i> violence often hinder, <i>but</i> never further, the work of God."--<i>Henry's Exposition.</i> (9.) PREPOSITIONS: "He has kept <i>among us</i>, in times of peace, standing armies, <i>without</i> the consent of our legislatures."--<i>Dec. of Indep.</i> (10.) INTERJECTIONS: "<i>Oh</i>, my dear strong-box! <i>Oh</i>, my lost guineas! <i>Oh</i>, poor, ruined, beggared old man! <i>Boo! hoo! hoo!</i>"--MOLIERE: <i>Burgh's Art of Speaking</i>, p. 266.</p>

EXAMPLES FOR PARSING.</p>
<p><i>Parsing</i> is the resolving or explaining of a sentence, or of some related word or words, according to the definitions and rules of grammar. Parsing is to grammar what ciphering is to arithmetic.</p>
<p>A <i>Praxis</i> is a method of exercise, or a form of grammatical resolution, showing the learner how to proceed. The word is Greek, and literally signifies action, doing, practice, or formal use.</p>
<p><br>
PRAXIS I--ETYMOLOGICAL.</p>
<p><i>In the first Praxis, it is required of the pupil--merely to distinguish</i> and define the different parts of speech.</p>
<p>The definitions to be given in the First Praxis, are one, and only one, for each word, or part of speech. Thus<i>:--</i></p>
<p>EXAMPLE PARSED.</p>
<p>"The patient ox submits to the yoke, and meekly performs the labour required of him."</p>
<p><i>The</i> is an article. 1.[132] An article is the word <i>the, an</i>, or <i>a</i>, which we put before nouns to limit their signification.</p>
<p><i>Patient</i> is an adjective. 1. An adjective is a word added to a noun or pronoun, and generally expresses quality.</p>
<p><i>Ox</i> is a noun. 1. A noun is the name of any person, place, or thing, that can be known or mentioned.</p>
<p><i>Submits</i> is a verb. 1. A verb is a word that signifies <i>to be, to act</i>, or <i>to be acted upon.</i></p>
<p><i>To</i> is a preposition. 1. A preposition is a word used to express some relation of different things or thoughts to each other, and is generally placed before a noun or a pronoun.</p>
<p><i>The</i> is an article. 1. An article is the word <i>the, an</i>, or <i>a</i>, which we put before nouns to limit their signification.</p>
<p><i>Yoke</i> is a noun. 1. A noun is the name of any person, place, or thing, that can be known or mentioned.</p>
<p><i>And</i> is a conjunction. 1. A conjunction is a word used to connect words or sentences in construction, and to show the dependence of the terms so connected.</p>
<p><i>Meekly</i> is an adverb. 1. An adverb is a word added to a verb, a participle, an adjective, or an other adverb; and generally expresses time, place, degree, or manner.</p>
<p><i>Performs</i> is a verb. 1. A verb is a word that signifies <i>to be, to act</i>, or <i>to be acted upon.</i></p>
<p><i>The</i> is an article. 1. An article is the word <i>the, an</i>, or <i>a</i>, which we put before nouns to limit their signification.</p>
<p><i>Labour</i> is a noun. 1. A noun is the name of any person, place, or thing, that can be known or mentioned.</p>
<p><i>Required</i> is a participle. 1. A participle is a word derived from a verb, participating the properties of a verb, and of an adjective or a noun; and is generally formed by adding <i>ing, d</i>, or <i>ed</i>, to the verb.</p>
<p><i>Of</i> is a preposition. 1. A preposition is a word used to express some relation of different things or thoughts to each other, and is generally placed before a noun or a pronoun.</p>
<p><i>Him</i> is a pronoun. 1. A pronoun is a word used instead of a noun.</p>
<p><br>
LESSON I.--PARSING.</p>
<p>"A nimble tongue often trips. The rule of the tongue is a great attainment. The language of truth is direct and plain. Truth is never evasive. Flattery is the food of vanity. A virtuous mind loathes flattery. Vain persons are an easy prey to parasites. Vanity easily mistakes sneers for smiles. The smiles of the world are deceitful. True friendship hath eternal views. A faithful friend is invaluable. Constancy in friendship denotes a generous mind. Adversity is the criterion of friendship. Love and fidelity are inseparable. Few know the value of a friend till they lose him. Justice is the first of all moral virtues. Let justice hold, and mercy turn, the scale. A judge is guilty who connives at guilt. Justice delayed is little better than justice denied. Vice is the deformity of man. Virtue is a source of constant cheerfulness. One vice is more expensive than many virtues. Wisdom, though serious, is never sullen. Youth is the season of improvement."--<i>Dillwyn's Reflections</i>, pp. 4-27.</p>
<pre>  "Oh! my ill-chang'd condition! oh, my fate!
   Did I lose heaven for this?"--<i>Cowley's Davideis.</i>
</pre>
<p><br>
LESSON II.--PARSING.</p>
<p>"So prone is man to society, and so happy in it, that, to relish perpetual solitude, one must be an angel or a brute. In a solitary state, no creature is more timid than man; in society, none more bold. The number of offenders lessens the disgrace of the crime; for a common reproach is no reproach. A man is more unhappy in reproaching himself when guilty, than in being reproached by others when innocent. The pains of the mind are harder to bear than those of the body. Hope, in this mixed state of good and ill, is a blessing from heaven: the gift of prescience would be a curse. The first step towards vice, is to make a mystery of what is innocent: whoever loves to hide, will soon or late have reason to hide. A man who gives his children a habit of industry, provides for them better than by giving them a stock of money. Our good and evil proceed from ourselves: death appeared terrible to Cicero, indifferent to Socrates, desirable to Cato."--Home's Art of Thinking, pp. 26-53.</p>
<pre>  "O thou most high transcendent gift of age!
   Youth from its folly thus to disengage."--<i>Denham's Age</i>.
</pre>
<p><br>
LESSON III.--PARSING.</p>
<p>"Calm was the day, and the scene, delightful. We may expect a calm after a storm. To prevent passion is easier than to calm it."--<i>Murray's Ex.</i>, p. 5. "Better is a little with content, than a great deal with anxiety. A little attention will rectify some errors. Unthinking persons care little for the future."--See <i>ib.</i> "Still waters are commonly deepest. He laboured to still the tumult. Though he is out of danger, he is still afraid."--<i>Ib.</i> "Damp air is unwholesome. Guilt often casts a damp over our sprightliest hours. Soft bodies damp the sound much more than hard ones."--<i>Ib.</i> "The hail was very destructive. Hail, virtue! source of every good. We hail you as friends."--<i>Ib.</i>, p. 6. "Much money makes no man happy. Think much, and speak little. He has seen much of the world."--See <i>ib.</i> "Every being loves its like. We must make a like space between the lines. Behave like men. We are apt to like pernicious company."--<i>Ib.</i> "Give me more love, or more disdain."--<i>Carew</i>. "He loved Rachel more than Leah."--<i>Genesis</i>. "But how much that more is; he hath no distinct notion."--<i>Locke</i>.</p>
<pre>  "And my more having would be as a sauce
   To make me hunger more."--<i>Shakspeare</i>.

<p><br>
CHAPTER II.--ARTICLES.</p>
<p>An Article is the word <i>the, an</i>, or <i>a</i>, which we put before nouns to limit their signification: as, <i>The</i> air, <i>the</i> stars; <i>an</i> island, <i>a</i> ship.</p>
<p><i>An</i> and <i>a</i>, being equivalent in meaning, are commonly reckoned <i>one and</i> the same <i>article.</i> An <i>is used in preference to</i> a<i>, whenever the</i> following word begins with a vowel sound; as, <i>An</i> art, <i>an</i> end, <i>an</i> heir, <i>an</i> inch, <i>an</i> ounce, <i>an</i> hour, <i>an</i> urn. <i>A</i> is used in preference to <i>an</i>, whenever the following word begins with a consonant sound; as, <i>A</i> man, <i>a</i> house, <i>a</i> wonder, <i>a</i> one, <i>a</i> yew, <i>a</i> use, <i>a</i> ewer. Thus the consonant sounds of <i>w</i> and <i>y</i>, even when expressed by other letters, require <i>a</i> and not <i>an</i> before them.</p>
<p>A common noun, when taken in its <i>widest sense</i>, usually admits no article: as, "A candid temper is proper for <i>man</i>; that is, for <i>all</i> mankind<i>."--</i>Murray<i>.</i></p>
<p>In English, nouns without any article, or other definitive, are often used in a sense <i>indefinitely partitive</i>: as, "He took <i>bread</i>, and gave thanks."--<i>Acts</i>. That is, "<i>some bread</i>." "To buy <i>food</i> are thy servants come."--<i>Genesis</i>. That is, "<i>some food</i>." "There are <i>fishes</i> that have wings, and are not strangers to the airy region."--<i>Locke's Essay</i>, p. 322. That is, "<i>some fishes</i>."</p>
<p>"Words in which nothing but the <i>mere being</i> of any thing is implied, are used without articles: as, 'This is not <i>beer</i>, but <i>water</i>;' 'This is not <i>brass</i>, but <i>steel</i>.'"--See <i>Dr. Johnson's Gram.</i>, p. 5.</p>
<p><i>An</i> or <i>a</i> before the genus, may refer to <i>a whole species</i>; and <i>the</i> before the species, may denote that whole species emphatically: as, "<i>A</i> certain bird <i>is termed</i> the cuckoo<i>, from</i> the sound <i>which it</i> emits."--<i>Blair</i>.</p>
<p>But <i>an</i> or <i>a</i> is commonly used to denote individuals as <i>unknown</i>, or as not specially distinguished from others: as, "I see <i>an object</i> pass by, which I never saw till now; and I say, 'There goes <i>a beggar</i> with <i>a long</i> beard<i>.'"--</i>Harris<i>.</i></p>
<p>And <i>the</i> is commonly used to denote individuals as <i>known</i>, or as specially distinguished from others: as, "<i>The man</i> departs, and returns a week after; and I say, 'There goes <i>the beggar</i> with <i>the long</i> beard<i>.'"--</i>Id.</p>
<p>The article <i>the</i> is applied to nouns of cither number: as, "<i>The</i> man, <i>the</i> men;" "<i>The</i> good boy, <i>the</i> good boys."</p>
<p><i>The</i> is commonly required before adjectives that are used by ellipsis as nouns: as, "<i>The young</i> are slaves to novelty; <i>the old</i>, to custom."--<i>Ld.</i> Kames.</p>
<p>The article <i>an</i> or <i>a</i> implies <i>unity</i>, or <i>one</i>, and of course belongs to nouns of the singular number only; as, <i>A</i> man,--<i>An</i> old man,--<i>A</i> good boy.</p>
<p><i>An</i> or <i>a</i>, like <i>one</i>, sometimes gives a collective meaning to an adjective of number, when the noun following is plural; as, <i>A few days,--A</i> hundred men,--One hundred pounds sterling<i>.</i></p>
<p>Articles should be <i>inserted</i> as often as the sense requires them; as, "Repeat the preterit and [<i>the</i>] perfect participle of the verb <i>to</i> abide<i>."--Error in</i> Merchant's American School Grammar<i>, p. 66.</i></p>
<p><i>Needless articles</i> should be omitted; they seldom fail to pervert the sense: as, "<i>The</i> Rhine, <i>the</i> Danube, <i>the</i> Tanais, <i>the</i> Po, <i>the</i> Wolga, <i>the</i> Ganges, like many hundreds of similar <i>names</i>, rose not from any obscure jargon or irrational dialect."--Error in <i>Dr. Murray's Hist. of</i> Europ. Lang.<i>, Vol. i, p. 327.</i></p>
<p>The articles can seldom be put <i>one for the other</i>, without gross impropriety; and of course either is to be preferred to the other, as it better suits the sense: as, "<i>The</i> violation of this rule never fails to hurt and displease <i>a</i> reader."--Error in <i>Blair's Lectures</i>, p. 107. Say, "<i>A</i> violation of this rule never fails to displease <i>the</i> reader."</p>
<p>CLASSES.</p>
<p>The articles are distinguished as the <i>definite</i> and the <i>indefinite</i>.</p>
<p>I. The <i>definite article</i> is <i>the</i>, which denotes some particular thing or things; as, <i>The</i> boy, <i>the</i> oranges.</p>
<p>II. The <i>indefinite article</i> is <i>an</i> or <i>a</i>, which denotes one thing of a kind, but not any particular one; as, <i>A</i> boy, <i>an</i> orange.</p>
<p><br>
MODIFICATIONS.[133]</p>
<p>The English articles have no modifications, except that <i>an</i> is shortened into <i>a</i> before the sound of a consonant; as, "In <i>an</i> epic poem, or <i>a</i> poem upon <i>an</i> elevated subject, <i>a</i> writer ought to avoid raising <i>a</i> simile on <i>a</i> low image."--<i>Ld. Kames.</i></p>

OBSERVATIONS.</p>
<p>OBS. 1.--No other words are so often employed as the articles. And, by reason of the various and very frequent occasions on which these definitives are required, no words are oftener misapplied; none, oftener omitted or inserted erroneously. I shall therefore copiously illustrate both their <i>uses</i> and their <i>abuses</i>; with the hope that every reader of this volume will think it worth his while to gain that knowledge which is requisite to the true use of these small but important words. Some parts of the explanation, however, must be deferred till we come to Syntax.</p>
<p>OBS. 2.--With the attempts of Tooke, Dalton, Webster, Cardell, Fowle, Wells,[134] Weld, Butler Frazee, Perley, Mulligan, Pinneo, S. S. Greene, and other writers, to <i>degrade</i> the article from its ancient rank among the parts of speech, no judicious reader, duly acquainted with the subject, can, I think, be well pleased. An article is not properly an "<i>adjective</i>," as they would have it to be; but it is a word of a peculiar sort--a <i>customary index</i> to the sense of nouns. It serves not merely to show the extent of signification, in which nouns are to be taken, but is often the principal, and sometimes the only mark, by which a word is known to have the sense and construction of a noun. There is just as much reason to deny and degrade the Greek or French article, (or that of any other language,) as the English; and, if those who are so zealous to reform our <i>the, an</i>, and <i>a</i> into <i>adjectives</i>, cared at all to appear consistent in the view of Comparative or General Grammar, they would either set about a wider reformation or back out soon from the pettiness of this.</p>
<p>OBS. 3.--First let it be understood, that <i>an</i> or <i>a</i> is nearly equivalent in meaning to the numeral adjective <i>one</i>, but less emphatic; and that <i>the</i> is nearly equivalent in meaning to the pronominal adjective <i>that</i> or <i>those</i>, but less emphatic. On <i>some</i> occasions, these adjectives may well be substituted for the articles; but <i>not generally</i>. If the articles were generally equivalent to adjectives, or even if they were generally <i>like</i> them, they would <i>be</i> adjectives; but, that adjectives may occasionally supply their places, is no argument at all for confounding the two parts of speech. Distinctions must be made, where differences exist; and, that <i>a,</i> an<i>, and</i> the<i>, do differ considerably from the other words which they most</i> resemble, is shown even by some who judge "the distinctive name of <i>article</i> to be useless." See <i>Crombie's Treatise</i>, Chap. 2. The articles therefore must be distinguished, not only from adjectives, but from each other. For, though both are <i>articles</i>, each is an index <i>sui generis</i>; the one definite, the other indefinite. And as the words <i>that</i> and <i>one</i> cannot often be interchanged without a difference of meaning, so the definite article and the indefinite are seldom, if ever, interchangeable. To put one for the other, is therefore, in general, to put one <i>meaning</i> for an other: "<i>A</i> daughter of <i>a</i> poor man"--"<i>The</i> daughter of <i>the</i> poor man"--"<i>A</i> daughter of <i>the</i> poor man"--and, "<i>The</i> daughter of <i>a</i> poor man," are four phrases which certainly have four different and distinct significations. This difference between the two articles may be further illustrated by the following example: "That Jesus was <i>a</i> prophet sent from God, is one proposition; that Jesus was <i>the</i> prophet, <i>the</i> Messiah, is an other; and, though he certainly was both <i>a</i> prophet and <i>the</i> prophet, yet <i>the</i> foundations of <i>the</i> proof of these propositions are separate and distinct."--<i>Watson's Apology</i>, p. 105.</p>
<p>OBS. 4.--Common nouns are, for the most part, names of large classes of objects; and, though what really constitutes the species must always be found entire in every individual, the several objects thus arranged under one general name or idea, are in most instances susceptible of such a numerical distribution as gives rise to an other form of the noun, expressive of plurality; as, <i>horse, horses</i>. Proper nouns in their ordinary application, are, for the most part, names of particular individuals; and as there is no plurality to a particular idea, or to an individual person or thing as distinguished from all others, so there is in general none to this class of nouns; and no room for <i>further restriction</i> by articles<i>. But we sometimes divert such nouns from their usual</i> signification, and consequently employ them with articles or in the plural form; as, "I endeavoured to retain it nakedly in my mind, without regarding whether I had it from <i>an Aristotle</i> or <i>a Zoilus, a Newton</i> or <i>a</i> Descartes<i>."--</i>Churchill's Gram.<i>, Pref., p. 8. "It is not enough to have</i> <i>Vitruviuses</i>, we must also have <i>Augustuses</i> to employ them."--<i>Bicknell's</i> Gram.<i>, Part ii, p. 61.</i></p>
<pre>  "<i>A Daniel</i> come to judgment! yea, <i>a Daniel</i>!"
       --SHAK. <i>Shylock</i>.
</pre>
<pre>  "Great Homer, in <i>th' Achilles</i>, whom he drew,
   Sets not that one sole Person in our View."
       --<i>Brightland's Gram.</i>, p. 183.
</pre>
<p>OBS. 5.--The article <i>an</i> or <i>a</i> usually denotes one out of several or many; one of a sort of which there are more; any one of that name, no matter which. Hence its effect upon a particular name, or proper noun, is <i>directly the reverse</i> of that which it has upon a common noun. It varies and fixes the meaning of both; but while it restricts that of the latter, it enlarges that of the former. It reduces the general idea of the common noun to any one individual of the class: as, "<i>A man</i>;" that is, "<i>One</i> man<i>, or</i> any man<i>." On the contrary, it extends the particular idea of the</i> proper noun, and makes the word significant of a class, by supposing others to whom it will apply: as, "<i>A Nero</i>;" that is, "<i>Any Nero</i>, or <i>any cruel</i> tyrant<i>." Sometimes, however, this article before a proper name, seems to</i> leave the idea still particular; but, if it really does so, the propriety of using it may be doubted: as, "No, not by <i>a John the Baptist</i> risen from the dead."--<i>Henry's Expos., Mark</i>, vi. "It was not solely owing to the madness and depravity of <i>a Tiberius, a Caligula, a Nero</i>, or <i>a</i> Caracalla<i>, that a cruel and sanguinary spirit, in their day, was so</i> universal."--<i>M'Ilvaine's Evid.</i>, p. 398.</p>
<p>OBS. 6.--With the definite article, the noun is applied, sometimes specifically, sometimes individually, but always <i>definitely</i>, always distinctively. This article is demonstrative. It marks either the particular individual, or the particular species,--or, (if the noun be plural,) some particular individuals of the species,--as being distinguished from all others. It sometimes refers to a thing as having been previously mentioned; sometimes presumes upon the hearer's familiarity with the thing; and sometimes indicates a limitation which is made by subsequent words connected with the noun. Such is the import of this article, that with it the singular number of the noun is often more comprehensive, and at the same time more specific, than the plural. Thus, if I say, "<i>The horse</i> is a noble animal," without otherwise intimating that I speak of some particular horse, the sentence will be understood to embrace collectively <i>that species</i> of animal; and I shall be thought to mean, "Horses are noble animals." But if I say, "<i>The horses</i> are noble animals," I use an expression so much more limited, as to include only a few; it must mean some particular horses, which I distinguish from all the rest of the species. Such limitations should be made, whenever there is occasion for them; but needless restrictions displease the imagination, and ought to be avoided; because the mind naturally delights in terms as comprehensive as they may be, if also specific. Lindley Murray, though not uniform in his practice respecting this, seems to have thought it necessary to use the plural in many sentences in which I should decidedly prefer the singular; as, "That <i>the learners</i> may have no doubts."--<i>Murray's Octavo</i> Gram.<i>, Vol. i, p. 81. "The business will not be tedious to</i> the scholars<i>."--</i>Ib.<i>, 81. "For the information of</i> the learners<i>."--</i>Ib.<i>,</i> 81. "It may afford instruction to <i>the learners</i>."--<i>Ib.</i>, 110. "That this is the case, <i>the learners</i> will perceive by the following examples."--<i>Ib.</i>, 326. "Some knowledge of it appears to be indispensable to <i>the scholars</i>."--<i>Ib.</i>, 335.</p>
<p>OBS. 7.--Proper names of a plural form and signification, are almost always preceded by the definite article; as, "<i>The Wesleys</i>,"--"<i>The twelve</i> Cæsars<i>,"--"</i>All the Howards<i>." So the names of particular nations, tribes,</i> and sects; as, <i>The Romans, the Jews, the Levites, the Stoics</i>. Likewise the plural names of mountains; as, <i>The Alps, the Apennines, the Pyrenees,</i> the Andes<i>. Of plural names like these, and especially of such as designate</i> tribes and sects, there is a very great number. Like other proper names, they must be distinguished from the ordinary words of the language, and accordingly they are always written with capitals; but they partake so largely of the nature of common nouns, that it seems doubtful to which class they most properly belong. Hence they not only admit, but require the article; while most other proper names are so definite in themselves, that the article, if put before them, would be needless, and therefore improper.</p>
<pre>  "<i>Nash, Rutledge, Jefferson</i>, in council great,
   And <i>Jay</i>, and <i>Laurens</i> oped the rolls of fate;
   <i>The Livingstons</i>, fair freedoms generous band,
   <i>The Lees, the Houstons</i>, fathers of the land."--<i>Barlow</i>.
</pre>
<p>OBS. 8.--In prose, the definite article is always used before names of rivers, unless the word <i>river</i>, be added; as, <i>The Delaware, the Hudson,</i> the Connecticut<i>. But if the word</i> river <i>be added, the article becomes</i> needless; as, <i>Delaware river, Hudson river, Connecticut river</i>. Yet there seems to be no impropriety in using both; as, <i>The Delaware river, the</i> Hudson river, the Connecticut river<i>. And if the common noun be placed</i> before the proper name, the article is again necessary; as, <i>The river</i> Delaware, the river Hudson, the river Connecticut<i>. In the first form of</i> expression, however, the article has not usually been resolved by grammarians as relating to the proper name; but these examples, and others of a similar character, have been supposed elliptical: as, "<i>The</i> [river] <i>Potomac</i>"--"<i>The</i> [ship] <i>Constitution</i>,"--"<i>The</i> [steamboat] <i>Fulton</i>." Upon this supposition, the words in the first and fourth forms are to be parsed alike; the article relating to the common noun, expressed or understood, and the proper noun being in apposition with the appellative. But in the second form, the apposition is reversed; and, in the third, the proper name appears to be taken adjectively. Without the article, some names of rivers could not be understood; as,</p>
<pre>  "No more <i>the Varus</i> and <i>the Atax</i> feel
   The lordly burden of the Latian keel."--<i>Rowe's Lucan</i>, B. i. l. 722.
</pre>
<p>OBS. 9.--The definite article is often used by way of eminence, to distinguish some particular individual emphatically, or to apply to him some characteristic name or quality: as, "<i>The Stagirite</i>,"--that is, Aristotle; "<i>The Psalmist</i>," that is, David; "<i>Alexander the Great</i>,"--that is, (perhaps,) Alexander the Great <i>Monarch</i>, or Great <i>Hero</i>. So, sometimes, when the phrase relates to a collective body of men: as, "<i>The</i> Honourable, the Legislature<i>,"--"</i>The Honourable, the Senate<i>;"--that is,</i> "The Honourable <i>Body</i>, the Legislature," &amp;c. A similar application of the article in the following sentences, makes a most beautiful and expressive form of compliment: "These are the sacred feelings of thy heart, O Lyttleton, <i>the friend</i>."--<i>Thomson</i>. "The pride of swains Palemon was, <i>the generous</i> and <i>the rich</i>."--<i>Id.</i> In this last example, the noun <i>man</i> is understood after "<i>generous</i>," and again after "<i>rich</i>;" for, the article being an index to the noun, I conceive it to be improper ever to construe two articles as having reference to one unrepeated word. Dr. Priestley says, "We sometimes <i>repeat the article</i>, when the epithet precedes the substantive; as He was met by <i>the</i> worshipful <i>the</i> magistrates."--<i>Gram.</i>, p. 148. It is true, we occasionally meet with such fulsome phraseology as this; but the question is, how is it to be explained? I imagine that the word <i>personages</i>, or something equivalent, must be understood after <i>worshipful</i>, and that the Doctor ought to have inserted a comma there.</p>
<p>OBS. 10.--In Greek, there is no article corresponding to our <i>an</i> or <i>a</i>, consequently <i>man</i> and <i>a man</i> are rendered alike; the word, [Greek: anthropos] may mean either. See, in the original, these texts: "There was <i>a man</i> sent from God," (<i>John</i>, i, 6,) and, "What is <i>man</i>, that thou art mindful of him?"--<i>Heb.</i>, ii, 6. So of other nouns. But the <i>definite</i> article of that language, which is exactly equivalent to our <i>the</i>, is a declinable word, making no small figure in grammar. It is varied by numbers, genders, and cases; so that it assumes more than twenty different forms, and becomes susceptible of six and thirty different ways of <i>agreement</i>. But this article in English is perfectly simple, being entirely destitute of grammatical modifications, and consequently incapable of any form of grammatical agreement or disagreement--a circumstance of which many of our grammarians seem to be ignorant; since they prescribe a rule, wherein they say, it "<i>agrees</i>," "<i>may agree</i>," or "<i>must agree</i>," with its noun. Nor has the indefinite article any variation of form, except the change from <i>an</i> to <i>a</i>, which has been made for the sake of brevity or euphony.</p>
<p>OBS. 11.--As <i>an</i> or <i>a</i> conveys the idea of unity, of course it applies to no other than nouns of the singular number. <i>An eagle</i> is one eagle, and the plural word <i>eagles</i> denotes more than one; but what could possibly be meant by "<i>ans eagles</i>," if such a phrase were invented? Harris very strangely says, "The Greeks have no article correspondent to <i>an</i> or <i>a</i>, but <i>supply its place by a NEGATION of their article</i>. And even in English, <i>where</i> the article <i>a</i> cannot be used, as <i>in</i> plurals, <i>its force is</i> exprest by the same <i>NEGATION."--</i>Harris's Hermes<i>, p. 218. What a sample</i> of grammar is this! Besides several minor faults, we have here a <i>nonentity</i>, a NEGATION <i>of the Greek article</i>, made to occupy a place in language, and to express <i>force!</i> The force of what? Of a plural <i>an</i> or <i>a,!</i> of such a word as <i>ans</i> or <i>aes!</i> The error of the first of these sentences, Dr. Blair has copied entire into his eighth lecture.</p>
<p>OBS. 12.--The following rules of agreement, though found in many English grammars, are not only objectionable with respect to the sense intended, but so badly written as to be scarcely intelligible in any sense: 1. "The article <i>a</i> or <i>an agrees</i> with nouns <i>in</i> the singular number <i>only,</i> individually, or collectively<i>: as, A Christian, an infidel, a score, a</i> thousand." 2. "The definite article <i>the</i> may <i>agree</i> with nouns <i>in the</i> singular <i>AND[135]</i> plural number<i>: as, The garden, the houses, the</i> stars."--<i>Murray's Gram.</i>, 8vo, p. 170; 12mo, 139; <i>Fish's Murray</i>, 98; <i>a</i> Teacher's<i>, 45. For the purpose of preventing any erroneous construction of</i> the articles, these rules are utterly useless; and for the purpose of syntactical parsing, or the grammatical resolution of this part of speech, they are awkward and inconvenient. The syntax of the articles may be much better expressed in this manner: "<i>Articles relate to the nouns which they</i> limit<i>," for, in English, the bearing of the articles upon other words is</i> properly that of simple <i>relation</i>, or dependence, according to the sense, and not that of <i>agreement</i>, not a similarity of distinctive modifications.</p>
<p>OBS. 13.--Among all the works of earlier grammarians, I have never yet found a book which taught correctly the <i>application</i> of the two forms of the indefinite article <i>an</i> or <i>a</i>. Murray, contrary to Johnson and Webster, considers <i>a</i> to be the original word, and <i>an</i> the euphonic derivative. He says: "<i>A</i> becomes <i>an</i> before a vowel, and before a silent <i>h</i>. But if <i>the h be</i> sounded, <i>the a only</i> is to be used."--<i>Murray's</i> Gram.<i>, p. 31. To this he adds, in a marginal note, "</i>A instead of an <i>is</i> <i>now</i> used before words beginning with <i>u</i> long. It is used before <i>one.</i> An <i>must be used before</i> words <i>WHERE</i> the h <i>is not silent, if the accent</i> is on the second syllable; as, <i>an heroic action, an historical</i> account<i>."--</i>Ib. <i>This explanation, clumsy as it is, in the whole</i> conception; broken, prolix, deficient, and inaccurate as it is, both in style and doctrine; has been copied and copied from grammar to grammar, as if no one could possibly better it. Besides several other faults, it contains a palpable misuse of the article itself: "<i>the h</i>" which is specified in the second and fifth sentences, is the "<i>silent h</i>" of the first sentence; and this inaccurate specification gives us the two obvious solecisms of supposing, "<i>if the [silent] h be sounded</i>," and of <i>locating</i> "words WHERE the [silent] h is not silent!<i>" In the word</i> humour<i>, and its</i> derivatives, the <i>h</i> is silent, by all authority except Webster's; and yet these words require <i>a</i> and not <i>an</i> before them.</p>
<p>OBS. 14.--It is the <i>sound</i> only, that governs the form of the article, and not the <i>letter</i> itself; as, "Those which admit of the regular form, are marked with <i>an</i> R."--<i>Murray's Gram.</i>, p. 101. "<i>A</i> heroic poem, written by Virgil."--<i>Webster's Dict.</i> "Every poem of the kind has no doubt <i>a</i> historical groundwork."--<i>Philological Museum</i>, Vol. i, p. 457. "A poet must be <i>a</i> naturalist and <i>a</i> historian."--<i>Coleridge's Introduction</i>, p. 111. Before <i>h</i> in an unaccented syllable, either form of the article may be used without offence to the ear; and either may be made to appear preferable to the other, by merely aspirating the letter in a greater or less degree. But as the <i>h</i>, though ever so feebly aspirated has <i>something</i> of a consonant sound, I incline to think the article in this case ought to conform to the general principle: as, "<i>A historical</i> introduction has, generally, <i>a happy</i> effect to rouse attention."-- <i>Blair's Rhet.</i>, p. 311. "He who would write heroic poems, should make his whole life <i>a heroic</i> poem."--See <i>Life of Schiller</i>, p. 56. Within two lines of this quotation, the biographer speaks of "<i>an</i> heroic multitude!" The suppression of the sound of <i>h</i> being with Englishmen a very common fault in pronunciation, it is not desirable to increase the error, by using a form of the article which naturally leads to it. "How often do we hear <i>an air</i> metamorphosed into <i>a hair</i>, a <i>hat</i> into a <i>gnat</i>, and a <i>hero</i> into <i>a Nero!</i>"--<i>Churchill's Gram.</i>, p. 205. Thus: "Neither of them had that bold and adventurous ambition which makes a conqueror <i>an</i> hero.<i>"--</i>Bolingbroke, on History<i>, p. 174.</i></p>
<p>OBS. 15.--Some later grammarians are still more faulty than Murray, in their rules for the application of <i>an</i> or <i>a</i>. Thus Sanborn: "The vowels are <i>a, e, i, o</i>, and <i>u</i>. <i>An</i> should be used before words beginning with <i>any of these letters</i>, or with a silent <i>h.</i>"--<i>Analytical Gram.</i>, p. 11. "<i>An</i> is used before words beginning with <i>u</i> long or with <i>h not silent</i>, when the accent is on the second syllable; as, <i>an united</i> people, <i>an</i> historical <i>account,</i> an heroic <i>action."--</i>Ib.<i>, p. 85. "</i>A <i>is used when</i> the next word begins with a <i>consonant; an</i>, when it begins with a <i>vowel</i> or silent <i>h</i>."--<i>lb.</i>, p. 129. If these rules were believed and followed, they would greatly multiply errors.</p>
<p>OBS. 16.--Whether the word <i>a</i> has been formed from <i>an</i>, or <i>an</i> from <i>a</i>, is a disputed point--or rather, a point on which our grammarians dogmatize differently. This, if it be worth the search, must be settled by consulting some genuine writings of the twelfth century. In the pure Saxon of an earlier date, the words <i>seldom occur</i>; and in that ancient dialect <i>an</i>, I believe, is used only as a declinable numerical adjective, and <i>a</i> only as a preposition. In the thirteenth century, both forms were in common use, in the sense now given them, as may be seen in the writings of Robert of Gloucester; though some writers of a much later date--or, at any rate, <i>one</i>, the celebrated Gawin Douglas, a Scottish bishop, who died of the plague in London, in 1522--constantly wrote <i>ane</i> for both <i>an</i> and <i>a</i>: as,</p>
<pre>  "Be not ouer studyous to spy <i>ane</i> mote in myn E,
   That in gour awin <i>ane</i> ferrye bot can not se."
       --<i>Tooke's Diversions</i>, Vol. i, p. 124.
</pre>
<pre>  "<i>Ane</i> uthir mache to him was socht and sperit;
   Bot thare was <i>nane</i> of all the rout that sterit."
       --<i>Ib.</i>, Vol. i, p. 160.
</pre>
<p>OBS. 17.--This, however, was a <i>Scotticism</i>; as is also the use of <i>ae</i> for <i>a</i>: Gower and Chaucer used <i>an</i> and <i>a</i> as we now use them. The Rev. J. M. M'Culloch, in an English grammar published lately in Edinburgh, says, "<i>A</i> and <i>an</i> were originally <i>ae</i> and <i>ane</i>, and were probably used at first simply to convey the idea of unity; as, <i>ae</i> man, <i>ane</i> ox."--<i>Manual of E.</i> Gram.<i>, p. 30. For this idea, and indeed for a great part of his book, he</i> is indebted to Dr. Crombie; who says, "To signify unity, or one of a class, our forefathers employed <i>ae</i> or <i>ane</i>; as, <i>ae</i> man, <i>ane</i> ox."--<i>Treatise</i> on Etym. and Synt.<i>, p. 53. These authors, like Webster, will have</i> a <i>and</i> <i>an</i> to be <i>adjectives</i>. Dr. Johnson says, "<i>A</i>, an <i>article</i> set before nouns of the singular number; as, <i>a</i> man, <i>a</i> tree. This article has no plural signification. Before a word beginning with a vowel, it is written <i>an</i>; as, <i>an</i> ox, <i>an</i> egg; of which <i>a</i> is the contraction."--<i>Quarto</i> Dict., w. A<i>.</i></p>
<p>OBS. 18.--Dr. Webster says, "<i>A</i> is also an abbreviation of the Saxon <i>an</i> or <i>ane, one</i>, used before words beginning with an articulation; as, <i>a</i> table, <i>instead</i> of <i>an</i> table, or one table. <i>This is a modern change</i>; for, in Saxon, <i>an</i> was used before articulations as well as vowels; as, <i>an tid, a</i> time, <i>an gear</i>, a year."--<i>Webster's Octavo Dict., w. A</i>. A modern change, indeed! By his own showing in other works, it was made long before the English language existed! He says, "<i>An</i>, therefore, is the original English adjective or ordinal number <i>one</i>; and was never written <i>a</i> until after the Conquest."--<i>Webster's Philos. Gram.</i>, p. 20; <i>Improved</i> Gram.<i>, 14. "</i>The Conquest<i>," means the Norman Conquest, in 1066; but</i> English was not written till the thirteenth century. This author has long been idly contending, that <i>an</i> or <i>a</i> is not an <i>article</i>, but an <i>adjective</i>; and that it is not properly distinguished by the term "<i>indefinite</i>." Murray has answered him well enough, but he will not be convinced.[136] See <i>Murray's Gram.</i>, pp. 34 and 35. If <i>a</i> and <i>one</i> were equal, we could not say, "<i>Such a one</i>,"--"<i>What a one</i>,"--"<i>Many a</i> one<i>,"--"</i>This one thing<i>;" and surely these are all good English, though</i> <i>a</i> and <i>one</i> here admit no interchange. Nay, <i>a</i> is sometimes found before <i>one</i> when the latter is used adjectively; as, "There is no record in Holy Writ of the institution of <i>a one</i> all-controlling monarchy."--<i>Supremacy</i> of the Pope Disproved<i>, p. 9. "If not to</i> a one <i>Sole Arbiter."--</i>Ib.<i>, p.</i> 19.</p>
<p>OBS. 19.--<i>An</i> is sometimes a <i>conjunction</i>, signifying <i>if</i>; as, "Nay, <i>an</i> thou'lt mouthe, I'll rant as well as thou."--<i>Shak.</i> "<i>An</i> I have not ballads made on you all, and sung to fifty tunes, may a cup of sack be my poison."--<i>Id., Falstaff</i>. "But, <i>an</i> it were to do again, I should write again."--<i>Lord Byron's Letters</i>. "But <i>an</i> it be a long part, I can't remember it."--SHAKSPEARE: <i>Burgh's Speaker</i>, p. 136.</p>
<p>OBS. 20.--In the New Testament, we meet with several such expressions as the following: "And his disciples were <i>an hungred</i>."--SCOTT'S BIBLE: <i>Matt</i>, xii, 1. "When he was <i>an hungred.</i>"--<i>Ib.</i> xii, 3. "When he had need and was <i>an hungered.</i>"--<i>Ib. Mark</i>, ii, 25. Alger, the improver of Murray's Grammar, and editor of the Pronouncing Bible, taking this <i>an</i> to be the indefinite article, and perceiving that the <i>h</i> is sounded in <i>hungered</i>, changed the particle to <i>a</i> in all these passages; as, "And his disciples were <i>a hungered</i>." But what sense he thought he had made of the sacred record, I know not. The Greek text, rendered word for word, is simply this: "<i>And his disciples hungered</i>." And that the sentences above, taken either way, are <i>not good English</i>, must be obvious to every intelligent reader. <i>An</i>, as I apprehend, is here a mere <i>prefix</i>, which has somehow been mistaken in form, and erroneously disjoined from the following word. If so, the correction ought to be made after the fashion of the following passage from Bishop M'Ilvaine: "On a certain occasion, our Saviour was followed by five thousand men, into a desert place, where they were <i>enhungered</i>."--<i>Lectures on Christianity</i>, p. 210.</p>
<p>OBS. 21.--The word <i>a</i>, when it does not denote one thing of a kind, is not an article, but a genuine <i>preposition</i>; being probably the same as the French à, signifying <i>to, at, on, in</i>, or <i>of</i>: as, "Who hath it? He that died <i>a</i> Wednesday."--<i>Shak</i>. That is, <i>on</i> Wednesday. So sometimes before plurals; as, "He carves <i>a</i> Sundays."--<i>Swift</i>. That is, <i>on</i> Sundays. "He is let out <i>a</i> nights."--<i>Id.</i> That is, <i>on</i> nights--like the following example: "A pack of rascals that walk the streets <i>on</i> nights."--<i>Id.</i> "He will knap the spears <i>a</i> pieces with his teeth."--<i>More's Antid.</i> That is, <i>in</i> pieces, or <i>to</i> pieces. So in the compound word <i>now-a-days</i>, where it means <i>on</i>; and in the proper names, Thomas <i>à</i> Becket, Thomas <i>à</i> Kempis, Anthony <i>à</i> Wood, where it means <i>at</i> or <i>of</i>.</p>

   Waxis dolf and dull throw myne unwieldy age."--<i>Douglas.</i>
</pre>
<p>OBS. 22.--As a preposition, <i>a</i> has now most generally become a <i>prefix</i>, or what the grammarians call an inseparable preposition; as in <i>abed</i>, in bed; <i>aboard</i>, on board; <i>abroad</i>, at large; <i>afire</i>, on fire; <i>afore</i>, in front; <i>afoul</i>, in contact; <i>aloft</i>, on high; <i>aloud</i>, with loudness; <i>amain</i>, at main strength; <i>amidst</i>, in the midst; <i>akin</i>, of kin; <i>ajar</i>, unfastened; <i>ahead</i>, onward; <i>afield</i>, to the field; <i>alee</i>, to the leeward; <i>anew</i>, of new, with renewal. "<i>A-nights</i>, he was in the practice of sleeping, &amp;c.; but <i>a-days</i> he kept looking on the barren ocean, shedding tears."--<i>Dr. Murray's Hist. of Europ. Lang.</i>, Vol. ii, p. 162. Compounds of this kind, in most instances, follow verbs, and are consequently reckoned adverbs; as, <i>To go astray,--To turn aside,--To soar</i> aloft,--To fall asleep<i>. But sometimes the antecedent term is a noun or a</i> pronoun, and then they are as clearly adjectives; as, "Imagination is like to work better upon sleeping men, than <i>men awake</i>."--<i>Lord Bacon.</i> "<i>Man</i> alive<i>, did you ever make a</i> hornet afraid<i>, or catch a</i> weasel asleep?<i>"</i> And sometimes the compound governs a noun or a pronoun after it, and then it is a preposition; as, "A bridge is laid <i>across</i> a river."--<i>Webster's</i> Dict.<i>, "To break his bridge</i> athwart <i>the Hellespont."--</i>Bacon's Essays.</p>

</pre>
<p>OBS. 23.--In several phrases, not yet to be accounted obsolete, this old preposition <i>à</i> still retains its place as a separate word; and none have been more perplexing to superficial grammarians, than those which are formed by using it before participles in <i>ing</i>; in which instances, the participles are in fact governed by it: for nothing is more common in our language, than for participles of this form to be governed by prepositions. For example, "You have set the cask <i>a</i> leaking," and, "You have set the cask <i>to</i> leaking," are exactly equivalent, both in meaning and construction. "Forty and six years was this temple <i>in</i> building."--<i>John, ii, 20.</i> <i>Building</i> is not here a noun, but a participle; and <i>in</i> is here better than <i>a</i>, only because the phrase, <i>a</i> building<i>, might be taken for an article and a noun, meaning</i> an edifice<i>.[137] Yet, in almost all cases, other prepositions are, I think,</i> to be preferred to <i>à</i>, if others equivalent to it can be found. Examples: "Lastly, they go about to apologize for the long time their book hath been <i>a coming</i> out:" i.e., <i>in</i> coming out.--<i>Barclay's Works</i>, Vol. iii, p. 179. "And, for want of reason, he falls <i>a railing</i>::" i.e., <i>to</i> railing.--<i>Ib.</i>, iii, 357. "That the soul should be this moment busy <i>a</i> thinking<i>:" i.e.,</i> at <i>or</i> in <i>thinking.--</i>Locke's Essay<i>, p. 78. "Which,</i> once set <i>a going</i>, continue in the same steps:" i.e., <i>to</i> going.--<i>Ib.</i>, p. 284. "Those who contend for four per cent, have set men's mouths <i>a</i> watering <i>for money:" i.e.,</i> to <i>watering.--LOCKE:</i> in Johnson's Dict. <i>"An</i> other falls <i>a ringing</i> a Pescennius Niger:" i.e., <i>to</i> ringing.--ADDISON: <i>ib.</i> "At least to set others <i>a thinking</i> upon the subject:" i.e., <i>to</i> thinking.--<i>Johnson's Gram. Com.</i>, p. 300. "Every one that could reach it, cut off a piece, and fell <i>a eating</i>:" i.e., <i>to</i> eating.--<i>Newspaper.</i> "To go <i>a mothering</i>,[138] is to visit parents on Midlent Sunday."--<i>Webster's</i> Dict., w. Mothering. <i>"Which we may find when we come</i> a fishing here."--<i>Wotton.</i> "They go <i>a begging</i> to a bankrupt's door."--<i>Dryden.</i> "<i>A hunting</i> Chloë went."--<i>Prior.</i> "They burst out <i>a laughing</i>."--<i>M.</i> Edgeworth. <i>In the last six sentences,</i> a <i>seems more suitable than any</i> other preposition would be: all it needs, is an accent to distinguish it from the article; as, <i>à</i>.</p>
<p>OBS. 24.--Dr. Alexander Murray says, "To be <i>a</i>-seeking, is the relic of the Saxon to be <i>on</i> or <i>an</i> seeking. What are you a-seeking? is <i>different</i> from, What are you seeking? It means more fully <i>the going on</i> with the process."--<i>Hist. Europ. Lang</i>,, Vol. ii, p. 149. I disapprove of the hyphen in such terms as "<i>à</i> seeking," because it converts the preposition and participle into I know not what; and it may be observed, in passing, that the want of it, in such as "<i>the going on</i>," leaves us a loose and questionable word, which, by the conversion of the participle into a noun, becomes a nondescript in grammar. I dissent also from Dr. Murray, concerning the use of the preposition or prefix <i>a</i>, in examples like that which he has here chosen. After a <i>neuter verb</i>, this particle is unnecessary to the sense, and, I think, injurious to the construction. Except in poetry, which is measured by syllables, it may be omitted without any substitute; as, "I am <i>a walking</i>."--<i>Johnson's Dict., w. A</i>. "He had one only daughter, and she lay <i>a</i> dying."--<i>Luke</i>, viii, 42. "In the days of Noah, while the ark was <i>a</i> preparing."--<i>1 Pet.</i>, iii, 20. "Though his unattentive thoughts be elsewhere <i>a</i> wandering."--<i>Locke's Essay</i>, p. 284. Say--"be wandering elsewhere;" and omit the <i>a</i>, in all such cases.</p>
<pre>  "And--when he thinks, good easy man, full surely
   His greatness is <i>a</i> ripening--nips his root."--<i>Shak</i>.
</pre>
<p>OBS. 25.--"<i>A</i> has a peculiar signification, denoting the proportion of one thing to an other. Thus we say, The landlord hath a hundred <i>a</i> year; the ship's crew gained a thousand pounds <i>a</i> man."--<i>Johnson's Dict.</i> "After the rate of twenty leagues <i>a</i> day."--<i>Addison</i>. "And corn was at two sesterces <i>a</i> bushel."--<i>Duncan's Cicero</i>, p. 82. Whether <i>a</i> in this construction is the article or the preposition, seems to be questionable. Merchants are very much in the habit of supplying its place by the Latin preposition <i>per</i>, by; as, "Board, at $2 <i>per</i> week."--<i>Preston's</i> Book-Keeping<i>, p. 44. "Long lawn, at $12</i> per <i>piece."--</i>Dilworth's<i>, p.</i> 63. "Cotton, at 2s. 6d. <i>per</i> pound."--<i>Morrison's</i>, p. 75. "Exchange, at 12d. <i>per</i> livre."--<i>Jackson's</i>, p. 73. It is to be observed that <i>an</i>, as well as <i>a</i>, is used in this manner; as, "The price is one dollar <i>an</i> ounce." Hence, I think, we may infer, that this is not the old preposition <i>a</i>, but the article <i>an</i> or <i>a</i>, used in the distributive sense of <i>each</i> or <i>every</i>, and that the noun is governed by a preposition understood; as, "He demands a dollar <i>an</i> hour;" i. e., a dollar <i>for each</i> hour.--"He comes twice <i>a</i> year:" i. e., twice <i>in every</i> year.--"He sent them to Lebanon, ten thousand <i>a</i> month by courses:" (<i>1 Kings</i>, v, 14:) i. e., ten thousand, <i>monthly</i>; or, as our merchants say, "<i>per month</i>." Some grammarians have also remarked, that, "In mercantile accounts, we frequently see <i>a</i> put for <i>to</i>, in a very odd sort of way; as, 'Six bales marked 1 <i>a</i> 6.' The merchant means, 'marked <i>from</i> 1 to 6.' This is taken to be a relic of the Norman French, which was once the law and mercantile language of England; for, in French, <i>a</i>, with an accent, signifies <i>to</i> or <i>at</i>."--<i>Emmons's Gram.</i>, p. 73. Modern merchants, in stead of accenting the <i>a</i>, commonly turn the end of it back; as, @.</p>
<p>OBS. 26.--Sometimes a numeral word with the indefinite article--as <i>a few,</i> a great many, a dozen, a hundred, a thousand<i>--denotes an aggregate of</i> several or many taken collectively, and yet is followed by a plural noun, denoting the sort or species of which this particular aggregate is a part: as, "A few small fishes,"--"A great many mistakes,"--"A dozen bottles of wine,"--"A hundred lighted candles,"--"A thousand miles off." Respecting the proper manner of explaining these phrases, grammarians differ in opinion. That the article relates not to the plural noun, but to the numerical word only, is very evident; but whether, in these instances, the words <i>few, many, dozen, hundred</i>, and <i>thousand</i>, are to be called nouns or adjectives, is matter of dispute. Lowth, Murray, and many others, call them <i>adjectives</i>, and suppose a peculiarity of construction in the article;--like that of the singular adjectives <i>every</i> and <i>one</i> in the phrases, "<i>Every</i> ten days,"--"<i>One</i> seven times more."--<i>Dan.</i>, iii, 19. Churchill and others call them <i>nouns</i>, and suppose the plurals which follow, to be always in the objective case governed by <i>of</i>, understood: as, "A few [of] years,"--"A thousand [of] doors;"--like the phrases, "A <i>couple of</i> fowls,"--"A <i>score of</i> fat bullocks."--<i>Churchill's Gram.</i>, p. 279. Neither solution is free from difficulty. For example: "There are a great many adjectives."--<i>Dr. Adam</i>. Now, if <i>many</i> is here a singular nominative, and the only subject of the verb, what shall we do with <i>are</i>? and if it is a plural adjective, what shall we do with <i>a</i> and <i>great?</i> Taken in either of these ways, the construction is anomalous. One can hardly think the word "<i>adjectives</i>" to be here in the objective case, because the supposed ellipsis of the word <i>of</i> cannot be proved; and if <i>many</i> is a noun, the two words are perhaps in apposition, in the nominative. If I say, "<i>A thousand men</i> are on their way," the men <i>are the</i> thousand<i>, and the thousand</i> is nothing but the men<i>; so that I see not why</i> the relation of the terms may not be that of <i>apposition</i>. But if <i>authorities</i> are to decide the question, doubtless we must yield it to those who suppose the whole numeral phrase to be taken <i>adjectively</i>; as, "Most young Christians have, in the course of <i>half a dozen</i> years, time to read <i>a great many</i> pages."--<i>Young Christian</i>, p. 6.</p>
<pre>  "For harbour at <i>a thousand doors</i> they knock'd;
   Not one of all <i>the thousand</i> but was lock'd."--<i>Dryden</i>.
</pre>
<p>OBS. 27.--The numeral words considered above, seem to have been originally adjectives, and such may be their most proper construction now; but all of them are susceptible of being construed as nouns, even if they are not such in the examples which have been cited. <i>Dozen</i>, or <i>hundred</i>, or <i>thousand</i>, when taken abstractly, is unquestionably a noun; for we often speak of <i>dozens, hundreds</i>, and <i>thousands</i>. <i>Few</i> and <i>many</i> never assume the plural form, because they have naturally a plural signification; and <i>a</i> few <i>or</i> a great many <i>is not a collection so definite that we can well</i> conceive of <i>fews</i> and <i>manies</i>; but both are sometimes construed substantively, though in modern English[139] it seems to be mostly by ellipsis of the noun. Example: "The praise of <i>the judicious few</i> is an ample compensation for the neglect of <i>the illiterate many</i>."--<i>Churchill's</i> Gram.<i>, p. 278. Dr. Johnson says, the word</i> many <i>is remarkable in Saxon</i> for its frequent use. The following are some of the examples in which he calls it a substantive, or noun: "After him the rascal <i>many</i> ran."--<i>Spenser</i>. "O thou fond <i>many</i>."--<i>Shakspeare</i>. "A care-craz'd mother of a <i>many</i> children."--<i>Id.</i> "And for thy sake have I shed <i>many</i> a tear."--<i>Id.</i> "The vulgar and the <i>many</i> are fit only to be led or driven."--<i>South</i>. "He is liable to a great <i>many</i> inconveniences every moment of his life."--<i>Tillotson</i>. "Seeing a great <i>many</i> in rich gowns, he was amazed."--<i>Addison</i>.</p>
<pre>  "There parting from the king, the chiefs divide,
   And wheeling east and west, before their <i>many</i> ride."--<i>Dryden</i>.
</pre>
<p>OBS. 28.--"On the principle here laid down, we may account for a peculiar use of the article with the adjective <i>few</i>, and some other diminutives. In saying, 'A <i>few</i> of his adherents remained with him;' we insinuate, that they constituted a number sufficiently important to be formed into an aggregate: while, if the article be omitted, as, '<i>Few</i> of his adherents remained with him;' this implies, that he was nearly deserted, by representing them as individuals not worth reckoning up. A similar difference occurs between the phrases: 'He exhibited <i>a little</i> regard for his character;' and 'He exhibited <i>little</i> regard for his character.'"--<i>Churchill's Gram.</i>, p. 279. The word <i>little</i>, in its most proper construction, is an adjective, signifying <i>small</i>; as, "He was <i>little</i> of stature."--<i>Luke</i>. "Is it not a <i>little</i> one?"--<i>Genesis</i>. And in sentences like the following, it is also reckoned an adjective, though the article seems to relate to it, rather than to the subsequent noun; or perhaps it may be taken as relating to them both: "Yet <i>a little</i> sleep, <i>a</i> little <i>slumber,</i> a little <i>folding of the hands to sleep."--</i>Prov.<i>, vi,</i> 10; xxiv, 33. But by a common ellipsis, it is used as a noun, both with and without the article; as, "<i>A little</i> that a righteous man hath, is better than the riches of many wicked."--<i>Psalms</i>, xxxvii, 16. "Better is <i>little</i> with the fear of the Lord, than great treasure and trouble therewith."--<i>Prov.</i>, xv, 16. "He that despiseth little things, shall perish by <i>little</i> and <i>little</i>."--<i>Ecclesiasticus</i>. It is also used adverbially, both alone and with the article <i>a</i>; as, "The poor sleep <i>little</i>."--<i>Otway</i>. "Though they are <i>a little</i> astringent."--<i>Arbuthnot</i>. "When he had gone <i>a little</i> farther thence."--<i>Mark</i>, i, 19. "Let us vary the phrase [in] <i>a very little</i>" [degree].--<i>Kames</i>, Vol. ii, p. 163.</p>
<p>OBS. 29.--"As it is the nature of the articles to limit the signification of a word, they are applicable only to words expressing ideas capable of being individualized, or conceived of as single things or acts; and nouns implying a general state, condition, or habit, must be used without the article. It is not vaguely therefore, but on fixed principles, that the article is omitted, or inserted, in such phrases as the following: 'in terror, in fear, in dread, in haste, in sickness, in pain, in trouble; in <i>a</i> fright, in <i>a</i> hurry, in <i>a</i> consumption; <i>the</i> pain of his wound was great; her son's dissipated life was <i>a</i> great trouble to her."--<i>Churchill's Gram.</i>, p. 127.</p>
<p>OBS. 30.--Though <i>the, an</i>, and <i>a</i>, are the only articles in our language, they are far from being the only definitives. Hence, while some have objected to the peculiar distinction bestowed upon these little words, firmly insisting on throwing them in among the common mass of adjectives; others have taught, that the definitive adjectives--I know not how many--such as, <i>this, that, these, those, any, other, some, all, both,</i> each, every, either, neither<i>--"are much more properly articles than any</i> thing else."--<i>Hermes</i>, p. 234. But, in spite of this opinion, it has somehow happened, that these definitive adjectives have very generally, and very absurdly, acquired the name of <i>pronouns</i>. Hence, we find Booth, who certainly excelled most other grammarians in learning and acuteness, marvelling that the <i>articles</i> "were ever separated from the class of <i>pronouns</i>." To all this I reply, that <i>the, an</i>, and <i>a</i>, are worthy to be distinguished as <i>the only articles</i>, because they are not only used with much greater <i>frequency</i> than any other definitives, but are specially restricted to the limiting of the signification of nouns. Whereas the other definitives above mentioned are very often used to supply the place of their nouns; that is, to represent them understood. For, in general, it is only by ellipsis of the noun after it, and not as the representative of a noun going before, that any one of these words assumes the appearance of a pronoun. Hence, they are not pronouns, but adjectives. Nor are they "more properly articles than any thing else;" for, "if the essence of an article be to define and ascertain" the meaning of a noun, this very conception of the thing necessarily supposes the noun to be used with it.</p>
<p>OBS. 31.--The following example, or explanation, may show what is meant by definitives. Let the general term be <i>man</i>, the plural of which is <i>men: A</i> man<i>--one unknown or indefinite;</i> The man<i>--one known or particular;</i> The men<i>--some particular ones;</i> Any man<i>--one indefinitely;</i> A certain man<i>--one definitely;</i> This man<i>--one near;</i> That man<i>--one distant;</i> These men<i>--several near;</i> Those men<i>--several distant;</i> Such a man<i>--one like</i> some other; <i>Such men</i>--some like others; <i>Many a man</i>--a multitude taken singly; <i>Many men</i>--an indefinite multitude taken plurally; <i>A thousand</i> men<i>--a definite multitude;</i> Every man<i>--all or each without exception;</i> <i>Each man</i>--both or all taken separately; <i>Some man</i>--one, as opposed to none; <i>Some men</i>--an indefinite number or part; <i>All men</i>--the whole taken plurally; <i>No men</i>--none of the sex; <i>No man</i>--never one of the race.</p>

But, according to a principle expressed on page 225th, "<i>A</i> is to be used whenever the following word begins with a consonant sound." Therefore, <i>an</i> should here be changed to <i>a</i>; thus, "Honour is <i>a</i> useful distinction in life."]</p>

LESSON II.--INSERT ARTICLES.</p>
<p>"This veil of flesh parts the visible and invisible world."--<i>Sherlock</i>.</p>
<p>[FORMULE.--Not proper, because the article <i>the</i> is omitted before <i>invisible</i>, where the sense requires it. But, according to a suggestion on page 225th, "Articles should be inserted as often as the sense requires them." Therefore, <i>the</i> should be here supplied; thus, "This veil of flesh parts the visible and the invisible world."]</p>

LESSON III.--OMIT ARTICLES.</p>
<p>"The negroes are all the descendants of Africans."--<i>Morse's Geog</i>.</p>
<p>[FORMULE.--Not proper, because the article <i>the</i> before <i>descendants</i>, is useless to the construction, and injurious to the sense. But, according to a principle on page 225th, "Needless articles should be omitted; they seldom fail to pervert the sense." Therefore, <i>the</i> should be here omitted; thus, "The negroes are all <i>descendants</i> of Africans."]</p>
<p>"A Sybarite was applied as a term of reproach to a man of dissolute manners."--<i>Morse's Ancient Geog.</i>, p. 4. "The original signification of knave was a boy."--<i>Webster's El.

<p><br>
LESSON IV.--CHANGE ARTICLES.</p>
<p>"To enable us to avoid the too frequent repetition of the same word."--<i>Bucke's Gr.</i>, p, 52.</p>
<p>[FORMULE.--Not proper, because the article <i>the</i> is used to limit the meaning of "repetition," or "too frequent repetition," where <i>a</i> would better suit the sense. But, according to a principle on page 225th, "The articles can seldom be put one for the other, without gross impropriety; and either is of course to be preferred to the other, as it better suits the sense." Therefore, "<i>the</i>" should be <i>a</i>, which, in this instance, ought to be placed after the adjective; thus, "To enable us to avoid <i>too</i> frequent a repetition <i>of the same word."]</i></p>

"Contrast has always the effect to make each of the contrasted objects appear in the stronger light."--<i>Ib.</i>, i, 349; <i>Blair's Rhet.</i>, p. 167. "These remarks may serve to shew the great importance of the proper use of the article."--<i>Lowth's Gram.</i>, p. 12; <i>Murray's</i>, i, 171. "'Archbishop Tillotson,' says an author of the History of England, 'died in this year.'"--<i>Blair's Rhet.</i>, p. 107. "Pronouns are used instead of substantives, to prevent the too frequent repetition of them."--<i>Alex.</i> Murray's Gram.<i>, p. 22.

CHAPTER III.--NOUNS.</p>
<p>A Noun is the name of any person, place, or thing, that can be known or mentioned: as, <i>George, York, man, apple, truth</i>.</p>
<p><br>
OBSERVATIONS.</p>
<p>OBS. 1.--All words and signs taken <i>technically</i>, (that is, independently of their meaning, and merely as things spoken of,) are <i>nouns</i>; or, rather, are <i>things</i> read and construed <i>as nouns</i>; because, in such a use, they temporarily assume the <i>syntax</i> of nouns: as, "For this reason, I prefer <i>contemporary</i> to <i>cotemporary</i>."--<i>Campbell's Rhet.</i>, p. 175; <i>Murray's</i> Gram.<i>, i, p. 368. "I and J were formerly expressed by the same character;</i> as were U and V."--<i>W. Allen's Gram.</i>, p. 3. "<i>Us</i> is a personal pronoun."--<i>Murray</i>. "<i>Th</i> has two sounds."--<i>Ib.</i> "The '<i>s</i> cannot be a contraction of <i>his</i>, because '<i>s</i> is put to <i>female</i> [feminine] nouns; as, <i>Woman's beauty, the Virgin's delicacy</i>."--<i>Dr. Johnson's Gram.</i> "<i>Their</i> and <i>theirs</i> are the possessives likewise of <i>they</i>, when <i>they</i> is the plural of <i>it</i>."--<i>Ib.</i> "Let B be a <i>now</i> or instant."--<i>Harris's Hermes</i>, p. 103. "In such case, I say that the instant B is the end of the time A B."--<i>Ib.</i>, 103. "<i>A</i> is sometimes a noun: as, a great <i>A</i>."--<i>Todd's</i> Johnson<i>. "Formerly</i> sp <i>was cast in a piece, as</i> st's <i>are now."--</i>Hist. of Printing<i>, 1770.

<p>OBS. 2.--In parsing, the learner must observe the sense and use of each word, and class it accordingly. Many words commonly belonging to other parts of speech are occasionally used as nouns; and, since it is the manner of its use, that determines any word to be of one part of speech rather than of an other, whatever word is used directly as a noun, must of course be parsed as such.</p>

<p><br>
CLASSES.</p>
<p>Nouns are divided into two general classes; <i>proper</i> and <i>common</i>. I. A <i>proper noun</i> is the name of some particular individual, or people, or group; as, <i>Adam, Boston</i>, the <i>Hudson</i>, the <i>Romans</i>, the <i>Azores</i>, the <i>Alps</i>.</p>
<p>II. A <i>common noun</i> is the name of a sort, kind, or class, of beings or things; as, <i>Beast, bird, fish, insect,--creatures, persons, children</i>.</p>
<p>The particular classes, <i>collective, abstract</i>, and <i>verbal</i>, or <i>participial</i>, are usually included among common nouns. The name of a thing <i>sui generis</i> is also called common.</p>
<p>1. A <i>collective noun</i>, or <i>noun of multitude</i>, is the name of many individuals together; as, <i>Council, meeting, committee, flock</i>.</p>
<p>2. An <i>abstract noun</i> is the name of some particular quality considered apart from its substance; as, <i>Goodness, hardness, pride, frailty</i>.</p>
<p>3. A <i>verbal</i> or <i>participial noun</i> is the name of some action, or state of being; and is formed from a verb, like a participle, but employed as a noun: as, "The <i>triumphing</i> of the wicked is short."--<i>Job</i>, xx, 5.</p>
<p>4. A thing <i>sui generis</i>, (i. e., <i>of its own peculiar kind</i>,) is something which is distinguished, not as an individual of a species, but as a sort by itself, without plurality in either the noun or the sort of thing; as, <i>Galvanism, music, geometry</i>.</p>
<p>OBS. 1.--Through the influence of an article, a proper name sometimes acquires the import of a common noun: as, "He is <i>the Cicero</i> of his age;" that is, <i>the great orator</i>. "Many <i>a fiery Alp</i>;" that is, <i>high volcanic</i> mountain<i>. "Such is the following application of famous names; a Solomon</i> for a wise man, a Croesus for a rich man, a Judas for a traitor, a Demosthenes for an orator, and a Homer for a poet."--<i>Campbell's Rhet.</i>, p. 326.</p>
<pre>  "Consideration, like an angel, came,
   And whipp'd <i>th' offending Adam</i> out of him."--<i>Shak</i>.
</pre>
<p>OBS. 2.--A common noun, with the definite article before it, sometimes becomes proper: as, <i>The Park; the Strand; the Gharmel; the Downs; the</i> United States<i>.</i></p>
<p>OBS. 3.--The common name of a thing or quality personified, often becomes proper; our conception of the object being changed by the figure of speech: as, "My power," said <i>Reason</i>, "is to advise, not to compel."--<i>Johnson</i>. "Fair <i>Peace</i> her olive branch extends." For such a word, the form of parsing should be like this: "<i>Peace</i> is a <i>common noun, personified</i> proper<i>; of the third person, singular number, feminine gender, and</i> nominative case." Here the construction of the word as a proper noun, and of the <i>feminine gender</i>, is the result of the personification, and contrary to the literal usage.</p>
<p><br>
MODIFICATIONS.</p>
<p>Nouns have modifications of four kinds; namely, <i>Persons, Numbers,</i> Genders<i>, and</i> Cases<i>.</i></p>
<p><br>
PERSONS.</p>
<p>Persons, in grammar, are modifications that distinguish the speaker, the hearer, and the person or thing merely spoken of.</p>
<p>There are three persons; the <i>first</i>, the <i>second</i>, and the <i>third</i>.</p>
<p>The <i>first person</i> is that which denotes the speaker or writer; as, "<i>I</i> Paul <i>have written it."</i></p>
<p>The second person is that which denotes the hearer, or the person addressed; as, "<i>Robert</i>, who did this?"</p>
<p>The third person is that which denotes the person or thing merely spoken of; as, "<i>James</i> loves his book."</p>
<p><br>
OBSERVATIONS.</p>
<p>OBS. 1.--The distinction of persons is founded on the different relations which the objects mentioned in any discourse may bear to the discourse itself. The speaker or writer, being the mover and maker of the communication, of course stands in the nearest or <i>first</i> of these relations. The hearer or hearers, being personally present and directly addressed, evidently sustain the next or <i>second</i> of these relations; this relation is also that of the reader, when he peruses what is addressed to himself in print or writing. Lastly, whatsoever or whosoever is merely mentioned in the discourse, bears to it that more remote relation which constitutes the <i>third</i> person. The distinction of persons belongs to nouns, pronouns, and finite verbs; and to these it is always applied, either by peculiarity of form or construction, or by inference from the principles of concord. Pronouns are like their antecedents, and verbs are like their subjects, in person.</p>
<p>OBS. 2.--Of the persons, numbers, genders, cases, and some other grammatical modifications of words, it should be observed that they belong not exclusively to any one part of speech, but jointly and equally, to two or three. Hence, it is necessary that our <i>definitions</i> of these things be such as will apply to each of them in full, or under all circumstances; for the definitions ought to be as general in their application as are the things or properties defined. Any person, number, gender, case, or other grammatical modification, is really but one and the same thing, in whatever part of speech it may be found. This is plainly implied in the very nature of every form of syntactical agreement; and as plainly contradicted in one half, and probably more, of the definitions usually given of these things.</p>
<p>OBS. 3.--Let it be understood, that <i>persons, in grammar</i>, are not <i>words</i>, but mere forms, relations, or modifications of words; that they are things, thus named by a <i>figure</i>; <i>things</i> of the neuter gender, and not living souls. But persons, in common parlance, or in ordinary life, are <i>intelligent beings</i>, of one or the other sex. These objects, different as they are in their nature, are continually confounded by the makers of English grammars: as, "The <i>first</i> person is <i>the person who</i> speaks<i>."--</i>Comly's Gram.<i>, p. 17. So Bicknell, of London: "The</i> first person <i>speaks of</i> himself<i>; as,</i> I John take thee Elizabeth<i>. The</i> second person has the speech directed to <i>him</i>, and is supposed to be present; as, <i>Thou Harry art a wicked fellow</i>. The <i>third</i> person is spoken of, or described, and supposed to be <i>absent</i>; as, <i>That Thomas is a good man</i>. And in the same manner the plural pronouns are used, when more than one are spoken of."--<i>Bicknell's Grammatical Wreath</i>, p. 50. "The person speaking is the first person; the person spoken to, the second; and the person spoken of, the third."--<i>Russell's Gram.</i>, p. 16. "The first person is the speaker."--<i>Parker &amp; Fox's Gram.</i>, Part i, p. 6. "Person is that, which distinguishes a noun, that speaks, one spoken to, or one spoken about."--<i>S. B. Hall's Gram.</i>, p. 6. "A noun that speaks!" A noun "spoken to!" If ever one of Father Hall's nouns shall speak for itself, or answer when "spoken to," will it not reprove him? And how can the <i>first person</i> be "the <i>person</i> WHO <i>speaks</i>," when every word of this phrase is of the <i>third</i> person? Most certainly, <i>it is not</i> HE, nor any one of his sort. If any body can boast of being "<i>the first person in grammar</i>," I pray, <i>Who</i> is it? Is it not <i>I</i>, even <i>I</i>? Many grammarians say so. But nay: such authors know not what the first person in grammar is. The Rev. Charles Adams, with infinite absurdity, makes the three persons in grammar to be never any thing but <i>three nouns</i>, which hold a confabulation thus: "Person is defined to be <i>that</i> which distinguishes a <i>noun that speaks, one spoken</i> to, or one spoken of<i>. The</i> noun <i>that speaks [,] is the first person; as,</i> <i>I, James</i>, was present. The <i>noun</i> that is spoken to, is the second person; as, <i>James</i>, were you present? The <i>noun</i> that is spoken of is the third person; as, <i>James</i> was present."--<i>Adams's System of English Gram.</i>, p. 9. What can be a greater blunder, than to call the first person of a verb, of a pronoun, or even of a noun, "<i>the noun that speaks?</i>" What can be more absurd than are the following assertions? "<i>Nouns</i> are <i>in</i> the first person when <i>speaking</i>. Nouns are <i>of</i> the second person when <i>addressed</i> or <i>spoken to</i>."--<i>O. C. Felton's Gram.</i>, p. 9.</p>
<p>OBS. 4.--An other error, scarcely less gross than that which has just been noticed, is the very common one of identifying the three grammatical persons with certain <i>words</i>, called personal pronouns: as, "<i>I</i> is the first person, <i>thou</i> the second, <i>he, she</i> or <i>it</i>, the third."--<i>Smith's</i> Productive Gram.<i>, p. 53. "</i>I <i>is the first person, singular.</i> Thou <i>is the</i> second person, singular. <i>He, she</i>, or <i>it</i>, is the third person, singular. <i>We</i> is the first person, plural. <i>Ye</i> or <i>you</i> is the second person, plural. <i>They</i> is the third person, plural."--<i>L. Murray's Grammar</i>, p. 51; <i>Ingersoll's</i>, 54; <i>D. Adams's</i>, 37; <i>A. Flint's</i>, 18; <i>Kirkham's</i>, 98; <i>Cooper's</i>, 34; <i>T. H. Miller's</i>, 26; <i>Hull's</i>, 21; <i>Frost's</i>, 13; <i>Wilcox's</i>, 18; <i>Bacon's</i>, 19; <i>Alger's</i>, 22; <i>Maltby's</i>, 19; <i>Perley's</i>, 15; <i>S. Putnam's</i>, 22. Now there is no more propriety in affirming, that "<i>I is the first person</i>," than in declaring that <i>me, we, us, am,</i> ourselves, we think, I write<i>, or any other word or phrase</i> of <i>the first</i> person, <i>is</i> the first person. Yet Murray has given us no other definitions or explanations of the persons than the foregoing erroneous assertions; and, if I mistake not, all the rest who are here named, have been content to define them only as he did. Some others, however, have done still worse: as, "There are <i>three</i> personal pronouns; so called, because they denote the three persons, <i>who</i> are the subjects of a discourse, viz. 1st. <i>I, who</i> is <i>the person</i> speaking<i>; 2d</i> thou, who is <i>spoken to; 3d</i> he, she<i>, or</i> <i>it, who</i> is spoken of, and their plurals, <i>we, ye</i> or <i>you,</i> they<i>."--</i>Bingham's Accidence<i>, 20th Ed., p. 7. Here the two kinds of error</i> which I have just pointed out, are jumbled together. It is impossible to write <i>worse English</i> than this! Nor is the following much better: "Of the personal pronouns there are five, viz. <i>I</i>, in the first person, speaking; <i>Thou</i>, in the second person, spoken to; and <i>He, she, it</i>, in the third person, spoken of."--<i>Nutting's Gram.</i>, p. 25.</p>
<p>OBS. 5.--In <i>written</i> language, the <i>first person</i> denotes the writer or author; and the <i>second</i>, the reader or person addressed: except when the writer describes not himself, but some one else, as uttering to an other the words which he records. This exception takes place more particularly in the writing of dialogues and dramas; in which the first and second persons are abundantly used, not as the representatives of the author and his reader, but as denoting the fictitious speakers and hearers that figure in each scene. But, in discourse, the grammatical persons may be changed without a change of the living subject. In the following sentence, the three grammatical persons are all of them used with reference to one and the same individual: "Say ye of <i>Him whom</i> the Father hath sanctified and sent into the world, <i>Thou blasphemest</i>, because <i>I said I am</i> the <i>Son</i> of <i>God?</i>"--<i>John</i>, x, 36.</p>
<p>OBS. 6.-The speaker seldom refers to himself <i>by name</i>, as the speaker; and, of the objects which there is occasion to name in discourse, but comparatively few are such as can ever be supposed to speak. Consequently, <i>nouns</i> are rarely used in the first person; and when they do assume this relation, a pronoun is commonly associated with them: as, "<i>I John</i>,"--"<i>We</i> Britons<i>." These words I conceive to agree throughout, in person, number,</i> gender, and case; though it must be confessed, that agreement like this is not always required between words in apposition. But some grammarians deny the first person to nouns altogether; others, with much more consistency, ascribe it;[140] while very many are entirely silent on the subject. Yet it is plain that both the doctrine of concords, and the analogy of general grammar, require its admission. The reason of this may be seen in the following examples: "<i>Themistocles ad te veni</i>." "I Themistocles have come to you."--<i>Grant's Latin Gram.</i>, p. 72. "<i>Adsum Troius Æneas</i>."--<i>Virgil</i>. "<i>Romulus Rex regia arma offero</i>."--Livy. "<i>Annibal peto pacem</i>."--Id. "<i>Callopius recensui.</i>"--See <i>Terence's Comedies, at the end</i>. "<i>Paul</i>, an apostle, &amp;c., unto Timothy, <i>my</i> own son in the faith."--<i>1 Tim.</i>, i, 2. Again, if the word <i>God</i> is of the second person, in the text, "<i>Thou,</i> God<i>, seest me," why should any one deny that</i> Paul <i>is of the first</i> person, in this one? "<i>I Paul</i> have written it."--<i>Philemon</i>, 19. Or this? "The salutation by the hand of <i>me Paul</i>."--<i>Col.</i>, iv, 18. And so of the plural: "Of <i>you builders</i>."--<i>Acts</i>, iv, 11. "Of <i>us the apostles</i>."--<i>2</i> Pet.<i>, iii, 2. How can it be pretended, that, in the phrase, "</i>I Paul<i>,"</i> <i>I</i> is of the first person, as denoting the speaker, and <i>Paul</i>, of some other person, as denoting something or somebody that is <i>not</i> the speaker? Let the admirers of Murray, Kirkham, Ingersoll, R. C. Smith, Comly, Greenleaf, Parkhurst, or of any others who teach this absurdity, answer.</p>
<p>OBS. 7.--As, in the direct application of what are called Christian names, there is a kind of familiarity, which on many occasions would seem to indicate a lack of proper respect; so in a frequent and familiar use of the second person, as it is the placing of an other in the more intimate relation of the hearer, and one's self in that of the speaker, there is a sort of assumption which may seem less modest and respectful than to use the third person. In the following example, the patriarch Jacob uses both forms; applying the term <i>servant</i> to himself, and to his brother Esau the term <i>lord</i>: "Let <i>my lord, I</i> pray <i>thee</i>, pass over before <i>his servant</i>: and <i>I</i> will lead on softly."--<i>Gen.</i>, xxxiii, 14. For when a speaker or writer does not choose to declare himself in the <i>first</i> person, or to address his hearer or reader in the <i>second</i>, he speaks of both or either in the <i>third</i>. Thus Moses relates what <i>Moses</i> did, and Cæsar records the achievements of <i>Cæsar</i>. So Judah humbly beseeches Joseph: "Let <i>thy</i> servant <i>abide in stead of the lad a bondman to</i> my lord<i>."--</i>Gen.<i>, xliv,</i> 33. And Abraham reverently intercedes with God: "Oh! let not <i>the Lord</i> be angry, and I will speak."--<i>Gen.</i>, xviii, 30. And the Psalmist prays: "<i>God</i> be merciful unto us, and bless us; and cause <i>his</i> face to shine upon us."--<i>Ps.</i>, lxvii, 1. So, on more common occasions:--</p>
<pre>  "As will the rest, so <i>willeth Winchester</i>."--<i>Shak</i>.
</pre>
<pre>   "Richard of York, how <i>fares</i> our dearest <i>brother</i>?"--<i>Id.</i>[141]
</pre>
<p>OBS. 8.--When inanimate things are spoken to, they are <i>personified</i>; and their names are put in the second person, because by the figure the objects are <i>supposed</i> to be capable of hearing: as, "What ailed thee, <i>O thou</i> sea<i>, that thou fleddest?</i> thou Jordan<i>, that thou wast driven back?</i> Ye mountains<i>, that ye skipped like rams; and</i> ye little hills<i>, like lambs?</i> Tremble, <i>thou earth</i>, at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the God of Jacob."--<i>Psalms</i>, cxiv, 5-7.</p>
<p><br>
NUMBERS.</p>
<p>Numbers, in grammar, are modifications that distinguish unity and plurality.</p>
<p>There are two numbers; the <i>singular</i> and the <i>plural</i>.</p>
<p>The <i>singular number</i> is that which denotes but one; as, "The <i>boy</i> learns<i>."</i></p>
<p>The <i>plural number</i> is that which denotes more than one; as, "The <i>boys</i> learn<i>."</i></p>
<p>The plural number <i>of nouns</i> is regularly formed by adding <i>s</i> or <i>es</i> to the singular: as, <i>book, books; box, boxes; sofa, sofas; hero, heroes</i>.</p>
<p>When the singular ends in a sound which will unite with that of <i>s</i>, the plural is generally formed by adding <i>s only</i>, and the number of syllables is not increased: as, <i>pen, pens; grape, grapes</i>.</p>
<p>But when the sound of <i>s</i> cannot be united with that of the primitive word, the regular plural adds <i>s</i> to final <i>e</i>, and <i>es</i> to other terminations, and forms a separate syllable: as, <i>page, pages; fox, foxes</i>.</p>
<p>OBSERVATIONS.</p>
<p>OBS. 1.--The distinction of numbers serves merely to show whether we speak of one object, or of more. In some languages, as the Greek and the Arabic, there is a <i>dual</i> number, which denotes <i>two</i>, or a <i>pair</i>; but in ours, this property of words, or class of modifications, extends no farther than to distinguish unity from plurality, and plurality from unity. It belongs to nouns, pronouns, and finite verbs; and to these it is always applied, either by peculiarity of form, or by inference from the principles of concord. Pronouns are like their antecedents, and verbs are like their subjects, in number.</p>
<p>OBS. 2.--The most common way of forming the plural of English nouns, is that of simply adding to them an <i>s</i>; which, when it unites with a sharp consonant, is always sharp, or hissing; and when it follows a vowel or a flat mute, is generally flat, like <i>z</i>: thus, in the words, <i>ships, skiffs,</i> pits, rocks, depths, lakes, gulfs<i>, it is sharp; but in</i> seas, lays, rivers, hills, ponds, paths, rows, webs, flags<i>, it is flat. The</i> terminations which always make the regular plural in <i>es</i>, with increase of syllables, are twelve; namely, <i>ce, ge, ch</i> soft, <i>che</i> soft, <i>sh, ss, s,</i> se, x, xe, z<i>, and</i> ze<i>: as in</i> face, faces; age, ages; torch, torches; niche, niches; dish, dishes; kiss, kisses; rebus, rebuses; lens, lenses; chaise, chaises; corpse, corpses; nurse, nurses; box, boxes; axe, axes; phiz, phizzes; maze, mazes. <i>All other endings readily unite in sound</i> either with the sharp or with the flat <i>s</i>, as they themselves are sharp or flat; and, to avoid an increase of syllables, we allow the final <i>e</i> mute to remain mute after that letter is added: thus, we always pronounce as monosyllables the words <i>babes, blades, strifes, tithes, yokes, scales,</i> names, canes, ropes, shores, plates, doves<i>, and the like.</i></p>
<p>OBS. 3.--Though the irregular plurals of our language appear considerably numerous when brought together, they are in fact very few in comparison with the many thousands that are perfectly simple and regular. In some instances, however, usage is various in writing, though uniform in speech; an unsettlement peculiar to certain words that terminate in vowels: as, <i>Rabbis</i>, or <i>rabbies; octavos</i>, or <i>octavoes; attornies</i>, or <i>attorneys</i>. There are also some other difficulties respecting the plurals of nouns, and especially respecting those of foreign words; of compound terms; of names and titles; and of words redundant or deficient in regard to the numbers. What is most worthy of notice, respecting all these puzzling points of English grammar, is briefly contained in the following observations.</p>
<p>OBS. 4.--It is a general rule of English grammar, that all singular nouns ending with a vowel preceded by an other vowel, shall form the plural by simply assuming an <i>s</i>: as, <i>Plea, pleas; idea, ideas; hernia, hernias;</i> bee, bees; lie, lies; foe, foes; shoe, shoes; cue, cues; eye, eyes; folio, folios; bamboo, bamboos; cuckoo, cuckoos; embryo, embryos; bureau, bureaus; purlieu, purlieus; sou, sous; view, views; straw, straws; play, plays; key, keys; medley, medleys; viceroy, viceroys; guy, guys. <i>To this rule, the</i> plurals of words ending in <i>quy</i>, as <i>alloquies, colloquies, obloquies,</i> soliloquies<i>, are commonly made exceptions; because many have conceived</i> that the <i>u</i>, in such instances, is a mere appendage to the <i>q</i>, or is a consonant having the power of <i>w</i>, and not a vowel forming a diphthong with the <i>y</i>. All other deviations from the rule, as <i>monies</i> for <i>moneys,</i> allies <i>for</i> alleys, vallies <i>for</i> valleys, chimnies <i>for</i> chimneys<i>, &amp;c.,</i> are now usually condemned as errors. See Rule 12th for Spelling.</p>
<p>OBS. 5.--It is also a general principle, that nouns ending in <i>y</i> preceded by a consonant, change the <i>y</i> into <i>i</i>, and add <i>es</i> for the plural, without increase of syllables: as, <i>fly, flies; ally, allies; city, cities;</i> colony, colonies<i>. So nouns in</i> i<i>, (so far as we have any that are</i> susceptible of a change of number,) form the plural regularly by assuming <i>es</i>: as, <i>alkali, alkalies; salmagundi, salinagundies.</i> Common nouns ending in <i>y</i> preceded by a consonant, are numerous; and none of them deviate from the foregoing rule of forming the plural: thus, <i>duty,</i> duties<i>. The termination added is</i> es<i>, and the</i> y <i>is changed into</i> i<i>,</i> according to the general principle expressed in Rule 11th for Spelling. But, to this principle, or rule, some writers have supposed that <i>proper</i> nouns <i>were to be accounted exceptions. And accordingly we sometimes find</i> such names made plural by the mere addition of an <i>s</i>; as, "How come the <i>Pythagoras'</i>, [it should be, <i>the Pythagorases</i>,] the <i>Aristotles</i>, the <i>Tullys</i>, the <i>Livys</i>, to appear, even to us at this distance, as stars of the first magnitude in the vast fields of ether?"--<i>Burgh's Dignity</i>, Vol. i, p. 131. This doctrine, adopted from some of our older grammars, I was myself, at one period, inclined to countenance; (see <i>Institutes of English</i> Grammar<i>, p. 33, at the bottom;) but further observation having led me to</i> suspect, there is more <i>authority</i> for changing the <i>y</i> than for retaining it, I shall by-and-by exhibit some examples of this change, and leave the reader to take his choice of the two forms, or principles.</p>
<p>OBS. 6.--The vowel <i>a</i>, at the end of a word, (except in the questionable term <i>huzza</i>, or when silent, as in <i>guinea</i>,) has always its Italian or middle sound, as heard in the interjection <i>aha!</i> a sound which readily unites with that of <i>s</i> flat, and which ought, in deliberate speech, to be carefully preserved in plurals from this ending: as, <i>Canada, the Canadas;</i> cupola, cupolas; comma, commas; anathema, anathemas<i>. To pronounce the</i> final <i>a</i> flat, as <i>Africay</i> for <i>Africa</i>, is a mark of vulgar ignorance.</p>
<p>OBS. 7.--The vowel <i>e</i> at the end of a word, is generally silent; and, even when otherwise, it remains single in plurals from this ending; the <i>es</i>, whenever the <i>e</i> is vocal, being sounded <i>eez</i>, or like the word <i>ease</i>: as, <i>apostrophe, apostrophes; epitome, epitomes; simile, similes</i>. This class of words being anomalous in respect to pronunciation, some authors have attempted to reform them, by changing the <i>e</i> to <i>y</i> in the singular, and writing <i>ies</i> for the plural: as, <i>apostrophy, apostrophies; epitomy,</i> epitomies; simily, similies<i>. A reformation of some sort seems desirable</i> here, and this has the advantage of being first proposed; but it is not extensively adopted, and perhaps never will be; for the vowel sound in question, is not exactly that of the terminations <i>y</i> and <i>ies</i>, but one which seems to require <i>ee</i>--a stronger sound than that of <i>y</i>, though similar to it.</p>
<p>OBS. 8.--For nouns ending in open <i>o</i> preceded by a consonant, the regular method of forming the plural seems to be that of adding <i>es</i>; as in <i>bilboes, umboes, buboes, calicoes, moriscoes, gambadoes, barricadoes,</i> fumadoes, carbonadoes, tornadoes, bravadoes, torpedoes, innuendoes, viragoes, mangoes, embargoes, cargoes, potargoes, echoes, buffaloes, volcanoes, heroes, negroes, potatoes, manifestoes, mulattoes, stilettoes, woes<i>. In words of this class, the</i> e <i>appears to be useful as a means of</i> preserving the right sound of the <i>o</i>; consequently, such of them as are the most frequently used, have become the most firmly fixed in this orthography. In practice, however, we find many similar nouns very frequently, if not uniformly, written with <i>s</i> only; as, <i>cantos, juntos,</i> grottos, solos, quartos, octavos, duodecimos, tyros<i>. So that even the best</i> scholars seem to have frequently doubted which termination they ought to regard as the <i>regular</i> one. The whole class includes more than one hundred words. Some, however, are seldom used in the plural; and others, never. <i>Wo</i> and <i>potato</i> are sometimes written <i>woe</i> and <i>potatoe</i>. This may have sprung from a notion, that such as have the <i>e</i> in the plural, should have it also in the singular. But this principle has never been carried out; and, being repugnant to derivation, it probably never will be. The only English appellatives that are established in <i>oe</i>, are the following fourteen: seven monosyllables, <i>doe, foe, roe, shoe, sloe, soe, toe</i>; and seven longer words, <i>rockdoe, aloe, felloe, canoe, misletoe, tiptoe,</i> diploe<i>. The last is pronounced</i> dip'-lo-e <i>by Worcester; but Webster,</i> Bolles, and some others, give it as a word of two syllables only.[142]</p>
<p><br>
OBS. 9.--Established exceptions ought to be enumerated and treated as exceptions; but it is impossible to remember how to write some scores of words, so nearly alike as <i>fumadoes</i> and <i>grenados, stilettoes</i> and <i>palmettos</i>, if they are allowed to differ in termination, as these examples do in Johnson's Dictionary. Nay, for lack of a rule to guide his pen, even Johnson himself could not remember the orthography of the common word <i>mangoes</i> well enough to <i>copy</i> it twice without inconsistency. This may be seen by his example from King, under the words <i>mango</i> and <i>potargo</i>. Since, therefore, either termination is preferable to the uncertainty which must attend a division of this class of words between the two; and since <i>es</i> has some claim to the preference, as being a better index to the sound; I shall make no exceptions to the principle, that common nouns ending in <i>o</i> preceded by a consonant take <i>es</i> for the plural. Murray says, "<i>Nouns which</i> end in <i>o</i> have sometimes <i>es</i> added, to form the plural; as, cargo, echo, hero, negro, manifesto, potato, volcano, wo: and sometimes only <i>s</i>; as, folio, nuncio, punctilio, seraglio."--<i>Octavo Gram.</i>, p. 40. This amounts to nothing, unless it is to be inferred from his <i>examples</i>, that others like them in form are to take <i>s</i> or <i>es</i> accordingly; and this is what I teach, though it cannot be said that Murray maintains the principle.</p>
<p>OBS. 10.--Proper names of <i>individuals</i>, strictly used as such, have no plural. But when several persons of the same name are spoken of, the noun becomes in some degree common, and admits of the plural form and an article; as, "<i>The Stuarts, the Cæsars</i>."--<i>W. Allen's Gram.</i>, p. 41. These, however, may still be called <i>proper nouns</i>, in parsing; because they are only inflections, peculiarly applied, of certain names which are indisputably such. So likewise when such nouns are used to denote character: as, "<i>Solomons</i>, for wise men; <i>Neros</i>, for tyrants."--<i>Ib.</i> "Here we see it becomes a doubt which of the two <i>Herculeses</i>, was the monster-queller."--<i>Notes to Pope's Dunciad</i>, iv, 492. The proper names of <i>nations, tribes</i>, and <i>societies</i>, are generally plural; and, except in a direct address, they are usually construed with the definite article: as, "<i>The Greeks, the Athenians, the Jews, the Jesuits</i>." But such words may take the singular form with the indefinite article, as often as we have occasion to speak of an individual of such a people; as, "<i>A Greek, an</i> Athenian, a Jew, a Jesuit<i>." These, too, may be called</i> proper nouns<i>;</i> because they are national, patrial, or tribal names, each referring to some place or people, and are not appellatives, which refer to actual sorts or kinds, not considered local.</p>
<p>OBS. 11.--Proper names, when they form the plural, for the most part form it regularly, by assuming <i>s</i> or <i>es</i> according to the termination: as, <i>Carolina</i>, the <i>Carolinas</i>; <i>James</i>, the <i>Jameses</i>. And those which are only or chiefly plural, have, or ought to have, such terminations as are proper to distinguish them as plurals, so that the form for the singular may be inferred: as, "The <i>Tungooses</i> occupy nearly a third of Siberia."--<i>Balbi's Geog.</i>, p. 379. Here the singular must certainly be <i>a</i> Tungoose<i>. "The principal tribes are the</i> Pawnees<i>, the</i> Arrapahoes<i>, and</i> the <i>Cumanches</i>, who roam through the regions of the Platte, the Arkansaw, and the Norte."--<i>Ib.</i>, p. 179. Here the singulars may be supposed to be a <i>Pawnee</i>, an <i>Arrapaho</i>, and a <i>Cumanche</i>. "The Southern or Floridian family comprised the <i>Cherokees, Creeks, Chickasaws, Choctaws, Seminoles</i>, and <i>Natchez</i>."--<i>Ib.</i>, p. 179. Here all are regular plurals, except the last; and this probably ought to be <i>Natchezes</i>, but Jefferson spells it <i>Natches</i>, the singular of which I do not know. Sometimes foreign words or foreign terminations have been improperly preferred to our own; which last are more intelligible, and therefore better: as, <i>Esquimaux</i>, to <i>Esquimaus</i>; <i>Knistenaux</i>, to <i>Knistenaus</i>, or <i>Crees; Sioux</i>, to <i>Sious</i>, or <i>Dahcotahs; Iroquois</i>, to <i>Iroquoys</i>, or <i>Hurons</i>.</p>
<p>OBS. 12.--Respecting the plural of nouns ending in <i>i, o, u</i>, or <i>y</i>, preceded by a consonant, there is in present usage much uncertainty. As any vowel sound may be uttered with an <i>s</i>, many writers suppose these letters to require for plurals strictly regular, the <i>s</i> only; and to take <i>es</i> occasionally, by way of exception. Others, (perhaps with more reason,) assume, that the most usual, regular, and proper endings for the plural, in these instances, are <i>ies, oes, and ues</i>: as, <i>alkali, alkalies; halo,</i> haloes; gnu, gnues; enemy, enemies<i>. This, I think, is right for common</i> nouns. How far proper names are to be made exceptions, because they are proper names, is an other question. It is certain that some of them are not to be excepted: as, for instance, <i>Alleghany</i>, the <i>Alleghanies</i>; <i>Sicily</i>, the Two <i>Sicilies</i>; <i>Ptolemy</i>, the <i>Ptolemies</i>; <i>Jehu</i>, the <i>Jehues</i>. So the names of tribes; as, The <i>Missouries</i>, the <i>Otoes</i>, the <i>Winnebagoes</i>. Likewise, the <i>houries</i> and the <i>harpies</i>; which words, though not strictly proper names, are often written with a capital as such. Like these are <i>rabbies, cadies, mufties, sophies</i>, from which some writers omit the <i>e</i>. Johnson, Walker, and others, write <i>gipsy</i> and <i>gipsies</i>; Webster, now writes <i>Gipsey</i> and <i>Gipseys</i>; Worcester prefers <i>Gypsy</i>, and probably <i>Gypsies</i>: Webster once wrote the plural <i>gypsies</i>; (see his <i>Essays</i>, p. 333;) and Johnson cites the following line:--</p>
<pre>  "I, near yon stile, three sallow <i>gypsies</i> met."--<i>Gay</i>.
</pre>
<p>OBS. 13.--Proper names in <i>o</i> are commonly made plural by <i>s</i> only. Yet there seems to be the same reason for inserting the <i>e</i> in these, as in other nouns of the same ending; namely, to prevent the <i>o</i> from acquiring a short sound. "I apprehend," says Churchill, "it has been from an erroneous notion of proper names being unchangeable, that some, feeling the necessity of obviating this mispronunciation, have put an apostrophe between the <i>o</i> and the <i>s</i> in the plural, <i>in stead of an e</i>; writing <i>Cato's, Nero's</i>; and on a similar principle, <i>Ajax's, Venus's</i>; thus using the possessive case singular for the nominative or objective plural. Harris says very properly, 'We have our <i>Marks</i> and our <i>Antonies</i>: <i>Hermes</i>, B. 2, Ch. 4; for which those would have given us <i>Mark's</i> and <i>Antony's</i>."--<i>New Gram.</i>, p. 206. Whatever may have been the motive for it, such a use of the apostrophe is a gross impropriety. "In this quotation, ['From the Socrates's, the Plato's, and the Confucius's of the age,'] the proper names should have been pluralized like common nouns; thus, From the <i>Socrateses</i>, the <i>Platoes</i>, and the <i>Confuciuses</i> of the age."--<i>Lennie's Gram.</i>, p. 126; <i>Bullions's</i>, 142.</p>
<p>OBS. 14.--The following are some examples of the plurals of proper names, which I submit to the judgement of the reader, in connexion with the foregoing observations: "The Romans had their plurals <i>Marci</i> and <i>Antonii</i>, as we in later days have our <i>Marks</i> and our <i>Anthonies</i>."--<i>Harris's Hermes</i>, p. 40. "There seems to be more reason for such plurals, as the <i>Ptolemies, Scipios, Catos</i>: or, to instance in more modern names, the <i>Howards, Pelhams, and Montagues</i>."--<i>Ib.</i>, 40. "Near the family seat of the <i>Montgomeries</i> of Coil's-field."--<i>Burns's Poems</i>, Note, p. 7. "Tryphon, a surname of one of the <i>Ptolemies</i>."--<i>Lempriere's Dict.</i> "Sixteen of the <i>Tuberos</i>, with their wives and children, lived in a small house."--<i>Ib.</i> "What are the <i>Jupiters</i> and <i>Junos</i> of the heathens to such a God?"--<i>Burgh's Dignity</i>, i, 234. "Also when we speak of more than one person of the same name; as, the <i>Henries</i>, the <i>Edwards</i>."--<i>Cobbetts E.</i> Gram.<i>, ¶ 40. "She was descended from the</i> Percies <i>and the</i> <i>Stanleys</i>."--<i>Loves of the Poets</i>, ii, 102. "Naples, or the <i>Two</i> Sicilies<i>."--</i>Balbi's Geog.<i>, p. 273. The word</i> India<i>, commonly makes the</i> plural <i>Indies</i>, not <i>Indias</i>; and, for <i>Ajaxes</i>, the poets write <i>Ajaces</i>. But Richard Hiley says, "Proper nouns, when pluralized, follow the same rules as common nouns; as, Venus, the <i>Venuses</i>; Ajax, the <i>Ajaxes</i>; Cato, the <i>Catoes</i>; Henry, the <i>Henries</i>."--<i>Hiley's E. Gram.</i>, p. 18.</p>
<pre>  "He ev'ry day from King to King can walk,
   Of all our <i>Harries</i>, all our Edwards talk."--<i>Pope's Satires</i>, iv.
</pre>
<p>OBS. 15.--When a name and a title are to be used together in a plural sense, many persons are puzzled to determine whether the name, or the title, or both, should be in the plural form. For example--in speaking of two young ladies whose family name is Bell--whether to call them the <i>Miss</i> Bells<i>, the</i> Misses Bell<i>, or the</i> Misses Bells<i>. To an inquiry on this</i> point, a learned editor, who prefers the last, lately gave his answer thus: "There are two young ladies; of course they are 'the Misses.' Their name is Bell; of course there are two 'Bells.' Ergo, the correct phrase, in speaking of them, is--'the Misses Bells.'"--<i>N. Y. Com. Adv</i>. This puts the words in apposition; and there is no question, that it is <i>formally</i> correct. But still it is less agreeable to the ear, less frequently heard, and less approved by grammarians, than the first phrase; which, if we may be allowed to assume that the two words may be taken together as a sort of compound, is correct also. Dr. Priestley says, "When a name has a title prefixed to it, as <i>Doctor, Miss, Master</i>, &amp;c., the plural termination affects only the latter of the two words; as, 'The two <i>Doctor</i> Nettletons<b>--'The two <i>Miss Thomsons</i>;' though a strict analogy would</b> plead for the alteration of the former word, and lead us to say, 'The two <i>Doctors Nettleton'</i>--'The two <i>Misses Thomson</i>.'"--<i>Priestley's Gram.</i>, p. 59. The following quotations show the opinions of some other grammarians: "Two or more nouns in concordance, and forming one complex name, or a name and a title, have the plural termination annexed to the last only; as, 'The <i>Miss Smiths<b>--'The three</b></i> <b>Doctor Simpsons</b>--'The two <i>Master</i> Wigginses<i>.' With a few exceptions, and those not parallel to the examples</i> just given, we almost uniformly, in complex names, confine the inflection to the last or the latter noun."--<i>Dr. Crombie</i>. The foregoing opinion from Crombie, is quoted and seconded by Maunder, who adds the following examples: "Thus, Dr. Watts: 'May there not be <i>Sir Isaac Newtons</i> in every science?'--'You must not suppose that the world is made up of <i>Lady Aurora</i> Granvilles<i>.'"--</i>Maunder's Gram.<i>, p. 2.</i></p>
<p>OBS. 16.--These writers do not seem to accord with W. L. Stone, the editor above quoted, nor would his reasoning apply well to several of their examples. Yet both opinions are right, if neither be carried too far. For when the words are in apposition, rather than in composition, the first name or title must be made plural, if it refers to more than one: as, "The <i>Misses Bell and Brown</i>,"--"<i>Messrs. Lambert and Son</i>,"--"The <i>Lords</i> Calthorpe and Erskine<i>,"--"The</i> Lords Bishops <i>of Durham and St.</i> David's,"--"The <i>Knights Hospitalers</i>,"--"The <i>Knights Templars</i>,"--"The <i>Knights Baronets</i>." But this does not prove the other construction, which varies the last word only, to be irregular; and, if it did, there is abundant authority for it. Nor is that which varies the first only, to be altogether condemned, though Dr. Priestley is unquestionably wrong respecting the "<i>strict analogy</i>" of which he speaks. The joining of a plural title to one singular noun, as, "<i>Misses Roy</i>,"--"<i>The Misses</i> Bell<i>,"--"</i>The two Misses Thomson<i>," produces a phrase which is in itself</i> the <i>least analogous</i> of the three; but, "<i>The Misses Jane and Eliza</i> Bell<i>," is a phrase which nobody perhaps will undertake to amend. It</i> appears, then, that each of these forms of expression may be right in some cases; and each of them may be wrong, if improperly substituted for either of the others.</p>
<p>OBS. 17.--The following statements, though erroneous in several particulars, will show the opinions of some other grammarians, upon the foregoing point: "Proper nouns have the plural only when they refer to a race or family; as, <i>The Campbells</i>; or to several persons of the same name; as, <i>The eight Henrys; the two Mr. Sells; the two Miss Browns</i>; or, without the numeral, <i>the Miss Roys.</i> But in addressing letters in which both or all are equally concerned, and also when the names are different, we pluralize the <i>title</i>, (Mr. or Miss,) and write, <i>Misses</i> Brown; <i>Misses</i> Roy; <i>Messrs</i>, (for Messieurs, Fr.) Guthrie and Tait."<i>--Lennie's</i> Gram.<i>, p. 7. "If we wish to distinguish the</i> unmarried <i>from the</i> married Howards, we call them <i>the Miss Howards.</i> If we wish to distinguish these Misses from other Misses, we call them the <i>Misses Howard</i>."--<i>Fowle's</i> Gram. <i>"To distinguish several persons of the same name and family from</i> others of a different name and family, the <i>title</i>, and not the <i>proper</i> name<i>, is varied to express the distinction; as, the</i> Misses <i>Story, the</i> <i>Messrs.</i> Story. The elliptical meaning is, the Misses and Messrs, <i>who are</i> named <i>Story. To distinguish</i> unmarried <i>from</i> married <i>ladies,</i> the proper name<i>, and not the</i> title<i>, should be varied; as, the</i> Miss <i>Clarks. When</i> we mention more than one person of different names, the title should be expressed before each; as, <i>Miss</i> Burns, <i>Miss</i> Parker, and <i>Miss</i> Hopkinson, were present."--<i>Sanborn's Gram.</i>, p. 79. In the following examples from Pope's Works, the last word only is varied: "He paragons himself to two <i>Lord Chancellors</i> for law."--Vol. iii, p. 61. "Yearly panegyrics upon the <i>Lord Mayors</i>."--<i>Ib.</i>, p. 83.</p>
<pre>  "Whence hapless Monsieur much complains at Paris
   Of wrongs from Duchesses and <i>Lady Maries</i>."<i>--Dunciad</i>, B. ii, L 135.
</pre>
<p>OBS. 18.--The following eleven nouns in <i>f</i>, change the <i>f</i> into <i>v</i> and assume <i>es</i> for the plural: <i>sheaf, sheaves; leaf, leaves; loaf, loaves;</i> leaf, beeves; thief, thieves; calf, calves; half, halves; elf, elves; shelf, shelves; self, selves; wolf, wolves<i>. Three others in</i> fe <i>are</i> similar: <i>life, lives; knife, knives; wife, wives.</i> These are specific exceptions to the general rule for plurals, and not a series of examples coming under a particular rule; for, contrary to the instructions of nearly all our grammarians, there are more than twice as many words of the same endings, which take <i>s</i> only: as, <i>chiefs, kerchiefs, handkerchiefs,</i> mischiefs, beliefs, misbeliefs, reliefs, bassreliefs, briefs, feifs, griefs, clefs, semibrefs, oafs, waifs, coifs, gulfs, hoofs, roofs, proofs, reproofs, woofs, califs, turfs, scarfs, dwarfs, wharfs, fifes, strifes, safes. <i>The plural of</i> wharf <i>is sometimes written</i> wharves<i>; but perhaps</i> as frequently, and, if so, more accurately, <i>wharfs</i>. Examples and authorities: "<i>Wharf, wharfs</i>."--<i>Brightland's Gram.</i>, p. 80; <i>Ward's</i>, 24; <i>Goar's</i>, 26; <i>Lennie's</i>, 7; <i>Bucke's</i>, 39. "There were not in London so many <i>wharfs</i>, or <i>keys</i>, for the landing of merchants' goods."--CHILD: <i>in</i> Johnson's Dict. <i>"The</i> wharfs <i>of Boston are also worthy of</i> notice."--<i>Balbi's Geog.</i>, p. 37. "Between banks thickly clad with dwelling-houses, manufactories, and <i>wharfs</i>."<i>--London Morn. Chronicle</i>, 1833. Nouns in <i>ff</i> take <i>s</i> only; as, <i>skiffs, stuffs, gaffs</i>. But the plural of <i>staff</i> has hitherto been generally written <i>staves</i>; a puzzling and useless anomaly, both in form and sound: for all the compounds of <i>staff</i> are regular; as, <i>distaffs, whipstaffs, tipstaffs, flagstaffs,</i> quarterstaffs<i>; and</i> staves <i>is the regular plural of</i> stave<i>, a word now</i> in very common use with a different meaning, as every cooper and every musician knows. <i>Staffs</i> is now sometimes used; as, "I saw the husbandmen bending over their <i>staffs</i>."--<i>Lord Carnarvon</i>. "With their <i>staffs</i> in their hands for very age."--<i>Hope of Israel</i>, p. 16. "To distinguish between the two <i>staffs</i>."--<i>Comstock's Elocution</i>, p. 43. In one instance, I observe, a very excellent scholar has written <i>selfs</i> for <i>selves</i>, but the latter is the established plural of <i>self</i>:</p>
<pre>  "Self-love would cease, or be dilated, when
   We should behold as many <i>selfs</i> as men."<i>--Waller's Poems</i>, p. 55.
</pre>
<p>OBS. 19.--Of nouns purely English, the following thirteen are the only simple words that form distinct plurals not ending in <i>s</i> or <i>es</i>, and four of these are often regular: <i>man, men; woman, women; child, children;</i> brother, brethren <i>or</i> brothers; ox, oxen; goose, geese; foot, feet; tooth, teeth; louse, lice; mouse, mice; die, dice <i>or</i> dies; penny, pence <i>or</i> <i>pennies; pea, pease</i> or <i>peas</i>. The word <i>brethren</i> is now applied only to fellow-members of the same church or fraternity; for sons of the same parents we always use <i>brothers</i>; and this form is sometimes employed in the other sense. <i>Dice</i> are spotted cubes for gaming; <i>dies</i> are stamps for coining money, or for impressing metals. <i>Pence</i>, as <i>six pence</i>, refers to the amount of money in value; <i>pennies</i> denotes the corns themselves. "We write <i>peas</i>, for two or more individual seeds; but <i>pease</i>, for an indefinite number in quantity or bulk."<i>--Webster's Dict.</i> This last anomaly, I think, might well enough "be spared; the sound of the word being the same, and the distinction to the eye not always regarded." Why is it not as proper, to write an order for "a bushel of <i>peas</i>," as for "a bushel of <i>beans</i>?" "<i>Peas</i> and <i>beans</i> may be severed from the ground before they be quite dry."<i>--Cobbett's E. Gram.</i>, ¶ 31.</p>
<p>OBS. 20.--When a compound, ending with any of the foregoing irregular words, is made plural, it follows the fashion of the word with which it ends: as, <i>Gentleman, gentlemen; bondwoman, bondwomen; foster-child,</i> foster-children; solan-goose, solan-geese; eyetooth, eyeteeth; woodlouse, woodlice<i>;[143]</i> dormouse, dormice; half-penny, halfpence, half-pennies<i>.</i> In this way, these irregularities extend to many words; though some of the metaphorical class, as <i>kite's-foot, colts-foot, bear's-foot, lion's-foot</i>, being names of plants, have no plural. The word <i>man</i>, which is used the most frequently in this way, makes more than seventy such compounds. But there are some words of this ending, which, not being compounds of <i>man</i>, are regular: as, <i>German, Germans; Turcoman, Turcomans; Mussulman,</i> Mussulmans; talisman, talismans; leman, lemans; caiman, caimans<i>.</i></p>
<p>OBS. 21.--Compounds, in general, admit but one variation to form the plural, and that must be made in the principal word, rather than in the adjunct; but where the terms differ little in importance, the genius of the language obviously inclines to a variation of the last only. Thus we write <i>fathers-in-law, sons-in-law, knights-errant, courts-martial,</i> cousins-german, hangers-on, comings-in, goings-out, goings-forth<i>, varying</i> the first; and <i>manhaters, manstealers, manslayers, maneaters, mandrills,</i> handfuls, spoonfuls, mouthfuls, pailfuls, outpourings, ingatherings, downsittings, overflowings<i>, varying the last. So, in many instances, when</i> there is a less intimate connexion of the parts, and the words are written with a hyphen, if not separately, we choose to vary the latter or last: as, <i>fellow-servants, queen-consorts, three-per-cents, he-goats, she-bears,</i> jack-a-dandies, jack-a-lanterns, piano-fortes<i>. The following mode of</i> writing is irregular in two respects; first, because the words are separated, and secondly, because both are varied: "Is it unreasonable to say with John Wesley, that <b>men buyers <i>are exactly on a level with</i> men</b> stealers<i>?"--GOODELL'S LECT. II:</i> Liberator<i>, ix, 65. According to analogy,</i> it ought to be: "<i>Manbuyers</i> are exactly on a level with <i>manstealers</i>." J. W. Wright alleges, that, "The phrase, 'I want two <i>spoonfuls</i> or <i>handfuls</i>,' though common, is improperly constructed;" and that, "we should say, 'Two <i>spoons</i> or <i>hands full</i>.'"--<i>Philos. Gram.</i>, p. 222. From this opinion, I dissent: both authority and analogy favour the former mode of expressing the plural of such quantities.</p>
<p>OBS. 22.--There is neither difficulty nor uncertainty respecting the proper forms for the plurals of compound nouns in general; but the two irregular words <i>man</i> and <i>woman</i> are often varied at the beginning of the looser kind of compounds, contrary to what appears to be the general analogy of similar words. Of the propriety of this, the reader may judge, when I shall have quoted a few examples: "Besides their <i>man-servants</i> and their <i>maid-servants</i>."--<i>Nehemiah</i>, vii, 67. "And I have oxen and asses, flocks, and <i>men-servants</i>, and <i>women-servants</i>."--<i>Gen.</i>, xxxii, 5. "I gat me <i>men-singers</i>, and <i>women-singers</i>, and the delights of the sons of men."--<i>Ecclesiastes</i>, ii, 8. "And she brought forth a <i>man-child</i>, who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron."--<i>Rev.</i>, xii, 5.--"Why have ye done this, and saved the <i>men-children</i> alive?"--<i>Exod.</i>, i, 18. Such terms as these, if thought objectionable, may easily be avoided, by substituting for the former part of the compound the separate adjective <i>male</i> or <i>female</i>; as, <i>male child, male children</i>. Or, for those of the third example, one might say, "<i>singing men</i> and <i>singing women</i>," as in <i>Nehemiah</i>, vii, 67; for, in the ancient languages, the words are the same. Alger compounds "<i>singing-men</i> and <i>singing-women</i>."</p>
<p>OBS. 23.--Some foreign compound terms, consisting of what are usually, in the language from which they come, distinct words and different parts of speech, are made plural in English, by the addition of <i>e</i> or <i>es</i> at the end. But, in all such cases, I think the hyphen should be inserted in the compound, though it is the practice of many to omit it. Of this odd sort of words, I quote the following examples from Churchill; taking the liberty to insert the hyphen, which he omits: "<i>Ave-Maries, Te-Deums, camera-obscuras,</i> agnus-castuses, habeas-corpuses, scire-faciases, hiccius-docciuses, hocus-pocuses, ignis-fatuuses, chef-d'oeuvres, congé-d'élires, flower-de-luces, louis-d'-ores, tête-à-têtes<i>."--</i>Churchill's Gram.<i>, p.</i> 62.</p>
<p>OBS. 24.--Some nouns, from the nature of the things meant, have no plural. For, as there ought to be no word, or inflection of a word, for which we cannot conceive an appropriate meaning or use, it follows that whatever is of such a species that it cannot be taken in any plural sense, must naturally be named by a word which is singular only: as, <i>perry, cider,</i> coffee, flax, hemp, fennel, tallow, pitch, gold, sloth, pride, meekness, eloquence<i>. But there are some things, which have in fact neither a</i> comprehensible unity, nor any distinguishable plurality, and which may therefore be spoken of in either number; for the distinction of unity and plurality is, in such instances, merely verbal; and, whichever number we take, the word will be apt to want the other: as, <i>dregs</i>, or <i>sediment;</i> riches<i>, or</i> wealth; pains<i>, or</i> toil; ethics<i>, or</i> moral philosophy; politics<i>, or</i> the science of government; belles-lettres<i>, or</i> polite literature<i>. So</i> darkness<i>, which in English appears to have no plural, is</i> expressed in Latin by <i>tenebræ</i>, in French by <i>ténèbres</i>, which have no singular. It is necessary that every noun should be understood to be of one number or the other; for, in connecting it with a verb, or in supplying its place by a pronoun, we must assume it to be either singular or plural. And it is desirable that singulars and plurals should always abide by their appropriate forms, so that they may be thereby distinguished with readiness. But custom, which regulates this, as every thing else of the like nature, does not always adjust it well; or, at least, not always upon principles uniform in themselves and obvious to every intellect.</p>
<p>OBS. 25.--Nouns of multitude, when taken collectively, generally admit the regular plural form; which of course is understood with reference to the individuality of the whole collection, considered as one thing: but, when taken distributively, they have a plural signification without the form; and, in this case, their plurality refers to the individuals that compose the assemblage. Thus, a <i>council</i>, a <i>committee</i>, a <i>jury</i>, a <i>meeting</i>, a <i>society</i>, a <i>flock</i>, or a <i>herd</i>, is singular; and the regular plurals are <i>councils, committees, juries, meetings, societies, flocks, herds</i>. But these, and many similar words, may be taken plurally without the <i>s</i>, because a collective noun is the name of many individuals together. Hence we may say, "The <i>council were</i> unanimous."--"The <i>committee are</i> in consultation."--"The <i>jury were</i> unable to agree."--"The <i>meeting have</i> shown their <i>discretion."--"The</i> society have settled their dispute."--"The <i>flock are</i> widely scattered."--"The whole <i>herd were</i> drowned <i>in the sea." The propriety of the last example seems questionable;</i> because <i>whole</i> implies unity, and <i>were drowned</i> is plural. Where a purer concord can be effected, it may be well to avoid such a construction, though examples like it are not uncommon: as, "Clodius was acquitted by <i>a</i> corrupt jury<i>, that had palpably taken shares of money before</i> they gave their <i>verdict."--</i>Bacon<i>. "And the</i> whole multitude <i>of the people</i> were praying <i>without, at the time of incense."--</i>Luke<i>, i, 10.</i></p>
<p>OBS. 26.--Nouns have, in some instances, a unity or plurality of meaning, which seems to be directly at variance with their form. Thus, <i>cattle</i>, for beasts of pasture, and <i>pulse</i>, for peas and beans, though in appearance singulars only, are generally, if not always, plural; and <i>summons,</i> gallows, chintz, series, superficies, molasses, suds, hunks, jakes, trapes<i>, and</i> corps<i>, with the appearance of plurals, are generally, if not</i> always, singular. Dr. Webster says that <i>cattle</i> is of both numbers; but wherein the oneness of cattle can consist, I know not. The Bible says, "God made--<i>cattle after their kind</i>."--<i>Gen.</i>, i, 25. Here <i>kind</i> is indeed singular, as if <i>cattle</i> were a natural genus of which one must be <i>a</i> cattle<i>; as</i> sheep <i>are a natural genus of which one is</i> a sheep<i>: but</i> whether properly expressed so or not, is questionable; perhaps it ought to be, "and cattle after their <i>kinds</i>." Dr. Gillies says, in his History of Greece, "<i>cattle was regarded</i> as the most convenient <i>measure</i> of value." This seems to me to be more inaccurate and unintelligible, than to say, "<i>Sheep was regarded</i> as the most convenient <i>measure</i> of value." And what would this mean? <i>Sheep</i> is not singular, unless limited to that number by some definitive word; and <i>cattle</i> I conceive to be incapable of any such limitation.</p>
<p>OBS. 27.--Of the last class of words above cited, some may assume an additional <i>es</i>, when taken plurally; as, <i>summonses, gallowses, chintses</i>: the rest either want the plural, or have it seldom and without change of form. <i>Corps</i>, a body of troops, is a French word, which, when singular, is pronounced <i>c=ore</i>, and when plural, <i>c=ores</i>. But <i>corpse</i>, a dead body, is an English word, pronounced <i>k~orps</i>, and making the plural in two syllables, <i>corpses</i>. <i>Summonses</i> is given in Cobb's Dictionary as the plural of <i>summons</i>; but some authors have used the latter with a plural verb: as, "But Love's first <i>summons</i> seldom <i>are</i> obey'd."--<i>Waller's</i> Poems<i>, p. 8. Dr. Johnson says this noun is from the verb</i> to summon<i>; and,</i> if this is its origin, the singular ought to be <i>a summon</i>, and then <i>summons</i> would be a regular plural. But this "singular noun with a plural termination," as Webster describes it, more probably originated from the Latin verb <i>submoneas</i>, used in the writ, and came to us through the jargon of law, in which we sometimes hear men talk of "<i>summonsing</i> witnesses." The authorities for it, however, are good enough; as, "<i>This</i> present <i>summons</i>."--SHAK.: <i>Joh. Dict.</i> "<i>This summons</i> he resolved to disobey."--FELL: <i>ib.</i> <i>Chints</i> is called by Cobb a "substantive <i>plural</i>" and defined as "cotton <i>cloths</i>, made in India;" but other lexicographers define it as singular, and Worcester (perhaps more properly) writes it <i>chintz</i>. Johnson cites Pope as speaking of "<i>a charming chints</i>," and I have somewhere seen the plural formed by adding es. "Of the Construction of single Words, or <i>Serieses</i> of Words."--<i>Ward's Gram.</i>, p. 114. Walker, in his Elements of Elocution, makes frequent use of the word "<i>serieses</i>," and of the phrase "<i>series of serieses</i>." But most writers, I suppose, would doubt the propriety of this practice; because, in Latin, all nouns of the fifth declension, such as <i>caries, congeries, series, species,</i> superficies<i>, make their nominative and vocative cases alike in both</i> numbers. This, however, is no rule for writing English. Dr. Blair has used the word <i>species</i> in a plural sense; though I think he ought rather to have preferred the regular English word <i>kinds</i>: "The higher <i>species</i> of poetry seldom <i>admit</i> it."--<i>Rhet.</i>, p. 403. <i>Specie</i>, meaning hard money, though derived or corrupted from <i>species</i>, is not the singular of that word; nor has it any occasion for a plural form, because we never speak of <i>a specie</i>. The plural of <i>gallows</i>, according to Dr. Webster, is <i>gallowses</i>; nor is that form without other authority, though some say, <i>gallows</i> is of both numbers and not to be varied: "<i>Gallowses</i> were occasionally put in order by the side of my windows."--<i>Leigh Hunt's</i> Byron<i>, p. 369.</i></p>
<pre>  "Who would not guess there might be hopes,
   The fear of <i>gallowses</i> and ropes,
   Before their eyes, might reconcile
   Their animosities a while?"--<i>Hudibras</i>, p. 90.
</pre>
<p>OBS. 28.--Though the plural number is generally derived from the singular, and of course must as generally imply its existence, we have examples, and those not a few, in which the case is otherwise. Some nouns, because they signify such things as nature or art has made plural or double; some, because they have been formed from other parts of speech by means of the plural ending which belongs to nouns; and some, because they are compounds in which a plural word is principal, and put last, are commonly used in the plural number only, and have, in strict propriety, no singular. Though these three classes of plurals may not be perfectly separable, I shall endeavour to exhibit them in the order of this explanation.</p>
<p>1. Plurals in meaning and form: <i>analects, annals,[144] archives, ashes,</i> assets, billiards, bowels, breeches, calends, cates, chops, clothes, compasses, crants, eaves, embers, estovers, forceps, giblets, goggles, greaves, hards <i>or</i> hurds, hemorrhoids, ides, matins, nippers, nones, obsequies, orgies,[145] piles, pincers <i>or</i> pinchers, pliers, reins, scissors, shears, skittles, snuffers, spectacles, teens, tongs, trowsers, tweezers, umbles, vespers, victuals<i>.</i></p>
<p>2. Plurals by formation, derived chiefly from adjectives: <i>acoustics,</i> aeronautics, analytics, bitters, catoptrics, commons, conics, credentials, delicates, dioptrics, economics, ethics, extraordinaries, filings, fives, freshes, glanders, gnomonics, goods, hermeneutics, hustings, hydrodynamics, hydrostatics, hydraulics, hysterics, inwards, leavings, magnetics, mathematics, measles, mechanics, mnemonics, merils, metaphysics, middlings, movables, mumps, nuptials, optics, phonics, phonetics, physics,[146] pneumatics, poetics, politics, riches, rickets, settlings, shatters, skimmings, spherics, staggers, statics, statistics, stays, strangles, sundries, sweepings, tactics, thanks, tidings, trappings, vives, vitals, wages,[147] withers, yellows<i>.</i></p>
<p>3. Plurals by composition: <i>backstairs, cocklestairs, firearms,[148]</i> headquarters, hotcockles, spatterdashes, self-affairs<i>. To these may be</i> added the Latin words, <i>aborigines, antipodes, antes, antoeci, amphiscii,</i> anthropophagi, antiscii, ascii, literati, fauces, regalia<i>, and</i> credenda<i>,</i> with the Italian <i>vermicelli</i>, and the French <i>belles-lettres</i> and <i>entremets</i>.</p>
<p>OBS. 29.--There are several nouns which are set down by some writers as wanting the singular, and by others as having it. Of this class are the following: <i>amends,[149] ancients, awns, bots, catacombs, chives, cloves,</i> cresses, dogsears, downs, dregs,[150] entrails, fetters, fireworks, greens, gyves, hatches, intestines, lees,[151] lungs, malanders, mallows, moderns, oats, orts, pleiads, premises, relics, remains, shackles, shambles,[152] stilts, stairs, tares, vetches<i>. The fact is, that these words have, or</i> ought to have, the singular, as often as there is any occasion to use it; and the same may, in general terms, be said of other nouns, respecting the formation of <i>the plural</i>.[153] For where the idea of unity or plurality comes clearly before the mind, we are very apt to shape the word accordingly, without thinking much about the authorities we can quote for it.</p>
<p>OBS. 30.--In general, where both numbers exist in common use, there is some palpable oneness or individuality, to which the article <i>a</i> or <i>an</i> is applicable; the nature of the species is found entire in every individual of it; and a multiplication of the individuals gives rise to plurality in the name. But the nature of a mass, or of an indefinite multitude taken collectively, is not found in individuals as such; nor is the name, whether singular, as <i>gold</i>, or plural, as <i>ashes</i>, so understood. Hence, though every noun must be of one number or the other, there are many which have little or no need of both. Thus we commonly speak of <i>wheat, barley, or</i> oats<i>, collectively; and very seldom find occasion for any other forms of</i> these words. But chafferers at the corn-market, in spite of Cobbett,[154] will talk about <i>wheats</i> and <i>barleys</i>, meaning different kinds[155] or qualities; and a gardener, if he pleases, will tell of an <i>oat</i>, (as does Milton, in his Lycidas,) meaning a single seed or plant. But, because <i>wheat</i> or <i>barley</i> generally means that sort of grain in mass, if he will mention a single kernel, he must call it a <i>grain of wheat</i> or a <i>barleycorn</i>. And these he may readily make plural, to specify any particular number; as, <i>five grains of wheat</i>, or <i>three barleycorns</i>.</p>
<p>OBS. 31.--My chief concern is with general principles, but the illustration of these requires many particular examples--even far more than I have room to quote. The word <i>amends</i> is represented by Murray and others, as being singular as well as plural; but Webster's late dictionaries exhibit <i>amend</i> as singular, and <i>amends</i> as plural, with definitions that needlessly differ, though not much. I judge "<i>an amends</i>" to be bad English; and prefer the regular singular, <i>an amend</i>. The word is of French origin, and is sometimes written in English with a needless final <i>e</i>; as, "But only to make a kind of honourable <i>amende</i> to God."--<i>Rollin's Ancient</i> Hist.<i>, Vol. ii, p. 24. The word</i> remains <i>Dr. Webster puts down as plural</i> only, and yet uses it himself in the singular: "The creation of a Dictator, even for a few months, would have buried every <i>remain</i> of freedom."--<i>Webster's Essays</i>, p. 70. There are also other authorities for this usage, and also for some other nouns that are commonly thought to have no singular; as, "But Duelling is unlawful and murderous, a <i>remain</i> of the ancient Gothic barbarity."--<i>Brown's Divinity</i>, p. 26. "I grieve with the old, for so many additional inconveniences, more than their small <i>remain</i> of life seemed destined to undergo."--POPE: <i>in Joh. Dict.</i> "A disjunctive syllogism is one whose major <i>premise</i> is disjunctive."--<i>Hedge's Logic</i>. "Where should he have this gold? It is some poor fragment, some slender <i>ort</i> of his remainder."--SHAK.: <i>Timon of Athens</i>.</p>
<p>OBS. 32.--There are several nouns which are usually alike in both numbers. Thus, <i>deer, folk,</i> fry, gentry, grouse, hose, neat, sheep, swine, vermin<i>, and</i> rest<i>, (i. e.</i> <i>the rest</i>, the others, the residue,) are regular singulars, but they are used also as plurals, and that more frequently. Again, <i>alms, aloes,</i> bellows, means, news, odds, shambles<i>, and</i> species<i>, are proper plurals,</i> but most of them are oftener construed as singulars. <i>Folk</i> and <i>fry</i> are collective nouns. <i>Folk</i> means <i>people</i>; <i>a folk, a people</i>: as, "The ants are <i>a people</i> not strong;"--"The conies are but <i>a feeble</i> folk<i>."--</i>Prov.<i>, xxx, 25, 26. "He laid his hands on a few sick</i> folk<i>, and</i> healed <i>them</i>."--<i>Mark</i>, vi, 5. <i>Folks</i>, which ought to be the plural of <i>folk</i>, and equivalent to <i>peoples</i>, is now used with reference to a plurality of individuals, and the collective word seems liable to be entirely superseded by it. A <i>fry</i> is a swarm of young fishes, or of any other little creatures living in water: so called, perhaps, because their motions often make the surface <i>fry</i>. Several such swarms might properly be called <i>fries</i>; but this form can never be applied to the individuals, without interfering with the other. "So numerous <i>was the fry</i>."--<i>Cowper</i>. "The <i>fry betake themselves</i> to the neighbouring pools."--<i>Quarterly</i> Review<i>. "You cannot think more contemptuously of</i> these gentry <i>than</i> <i>they</i> were thought of by the true prophets."--<i>Watson's Apology</i>, p. 93. "<i>Grouse</i>, a heathcock."--<i>Johnson</i>.</p>

   For better game, and look for <i>grouse</i>."--<i>Swift</i>.

<p>"Here's an English tailor, come hither for stealing out of <i>a</i> French <i>hose</i>."--<i>Shak</i>. "He, being in love, could not see to garter his <i>hose</i>."--<i>Id.</i> Formerly, the plural was <i>hosen</i>: "Then these men were bound, in their coats, their <i>hosen</i>, and their hats."--<i>Dan.</i>, iii, 21. Of <i>sheep</i>, Shakspeare has used the regular plural: "Two hot <i>sheeps</i>, marry!"--<i>Love's Labour Lost</i>, Act ii, Sc. 1.</p>

"The head of a wolf, dried and hanged up, will scare away <i>vermin</i>."--<i>Bacon</i>. "Cheslip, <i>a small vermin</i> that lies under stones or tiles."--SKINNER: in <i>Joh. and in Web. Dict.</i> "This is flour, the <i>rest is</i> bran."--"And the <i>rest were</i> blinded."--<i>Rom.</i>, xi, 7. "The poor beggar hath a just demand of <i>an alms</i>."--<i>Swift</i>. "Thine <i>alms are</i> come up for a memorial before God."--<i>Acts</i>, x, 4. "The draught of air performed the function of <i>a bellows</i>."--<i>Robertson's Amer.</i>, ii, 223. "As the <i>bellows</i> do<i>."--</i>Bicknell's Gram.<i>, ii, 11. "The</i> bellows are <i>burned."--</i>Jer.<i>, vi,</i> 29. "Let <i>a gallows</i> be made."--<i>Esther</i>, v, 14. "<i>Mallows are</i> very useful in medicine."--<i>Wood's Dict.</i> "<i>News</i>," says Johnson, "is without the singular, unless it be considered as singular."--<i>Dict.</i> "So <i>is</i> good <i>news</i> from a far country."--<i>Prov.</i>, xxv, 25. "Evil <i>news rides</i> fast, while good <i>news baits</i>."--<i>Milton</i>. "When Rhea heard <i>these news</i>, she fled."--<i>Raleigh</i>. "<i>News were brought</i> to the queen."--<i>Hume's Hist.</i>, iv, 426. "The <i>news</i> I bring <i>are</i> afflicting, but the consolation with which <i>they</i> are attended, ought to moderate your grief."--<i>Gil Blas</i>, Vol. ii, p. 20.

"Though thus <i>an odds</i> unequally they meet."--<i>Rowe's Lucan</i>, B. iv, l. 789. "Preëminent by so <i>much</i> odds<i>."--</i>Milton<i>. "To make a</i> shambles <i>of the parliament house."--</i>Shak<i>.</i> "The earth has been, from the beginning, a great Aceldama, <i>a shambles</i> of blood."--<i>Christian's Vade-Mecum</i>, p. 6. "<i>A shambles</i>" sounds so inconsistent, I should rather say, "<i>A shamble</i>." Johnson says, the etymology of the word is <i>uncertain</i>; Webster refers it to the Saxon <i>scamel</i>: it means <i>a butcher's stall, a meat-market</i>; and there would seem to be no good reason for the <i>s</i>, unless more than one such place is intended. "Who sells his subjects to the <i>shambles</i> of a foreign power."--<i>Pitt</i>. "A special idea is called by the schools <i>a</i> species<i>."--</i>Watts<i>. "He intendeth the care of</i> species<i>, or common</i> natures."--<i>Brown</i>. "ALOE, (al~o) <i>n.; plu.</i> ALOES."--<i>Webster's Dict.</i>, and <i>Worcester's</i>.

<p>OBS. 33.--There are some nouns, which, though really regular in respect to possessing the two forms for the two numbers, are not free from irregularity in the manner of their application. Thus <i>means</i> is the regular plural of <i>mean</i>; and, when the word is put for mediocrity, middle point, place, or degree, it takes both forms, each in its proper sense; but when it signifies things instrumental, or that which is used to effect an object, most writers use <i>means</i> for the singular as well as for the plural:[156] as, "By <i>this means</i>"--"By <i>those means</i>," with reference to one mediating cause; and, "By <i>these means</i>,"--"By <i>those means</i>," with reference to more than one. Dr. Johnson says the use of <i>means</i> for <i>mean</i> is not very grammatical; and, among his examples for the true use of the word, he has the following: "Pamela's noble heart would needs gratefully make known the valiant <i>mean</i> of her safety."--<i>Sidney.</i> "Their virtuous conversation was a <i>mean</i> to work the heathens' conversion."--<i>Hooker.</i> "Whether his wits should by that <i>mean</i> have been taken from him."--<i>Id.</i> "I'll devise a <i>mean</i> to draw the Moor out of the way."--<i>Shak.</i> "No place will please me so, no <i>mean</i> of death."--<i>Id.</i> "Nature is made better by no <i>mean</i>, but nature makes that <i>mean.</i>"--<i>Id.</i> Dr. Lowth also questioned the propriety of construing <i>means</i> as singular, and referred to these same authors as authorities for preferring the regular form. Buchanan insists that <i>means</i> is right in the plural only; and that, "The singular should be used as perfectly analogous; by this <i>mean</i>, by that <i>mean</i>."--<i>English</i> Syntax<i>, p. 103. Lord Kames, likewise, appears by his practice to have been</i> of the same opinion: "Of this the child must be sensible intuitively, for it has no other <i>mean</i> of knowledge."--<i>Elements of Criticism</i>, Vol. i, p. 357. "And in both the same <i>mean</i> is employed."--<i>Ib.</i> ii, 271. Caleb Alexander, too, declares "<i>this means</i>," "<i>that means</i>." and "<i>a means</i>," to be "ungrammatical."--<i>Gram.</i>, p. 58. But common usage has gone against the suggestions of these critics, and later grammarians have rather confirmed the irregularity, than attempted to reform it.</p>
<p>OBS. 34.--Murray quotes sixteen good authorities to prove that means may be singular; but whether it <i>ought</i> to be so or not, is still a disputable point. Principle is for the regular word <i>mean</i>, and good practice favours the irregularity, but is still divided. Cobbett, to the disgrace of grammar, says, "<i>Mean</i>, as a noun, is <i>never used in the singular</i>. It, like some other words, has broken loose from all principle and rule. By universal consent, it <i>is become always a plural</i>, whether used with <i>singular or plural</i> pronouns and articles, <i>or not</i>."--<i>E. Gram.</i>, p. 144. This is as ungrammatical, as it is untrue. Both mean and means are sufficiently authorized in the singular: "The prospect which by this mean is opened to you."--<i>Melmoth's Cicero</i>. "Faith in this doctrine never terminates in itself, but is <i>a mean</i>, to holiness as an end."--<i>Dr.</i> Chalmers, Sermons<i>, p. v. "The</i> mean <i>of basely affronting him."--</i>Brown's Divinity<i>, p. 19. "They used every</i> mean <i>to prevent the re-establishment</i> of their religion."--<i>Dr Jamieson's Sacred Hist.</i>, i, p. 20. "As a necessary <i>mean</i> to prepare men for the discharge of that duty."-- <i>Bolingbroke, on Hist.</i>, p. 153. "Greatest is the power of a <i>mean</i>, when its power is least suspected."--<i>Tupper's Book of Thoughts</i>, p. 37. "To the deliberative orator the reputation of unsullied virtue is not only useful, as a <i>mean</i> of promoting his general influence, it is also among his most efficient engines of persuasion, upon every individual occasion."--<i>J. Q.</i> Adams's Lectures on Rhetoric and Oratory<i>, i, 352. "I would urge it upon</i> you, as the most effectual <i>mean</i> of extending your respectability and usefulness in the world."--<i>Ib.</i>, ii, 395. "Exercise will be admitted to be a necessary <i>mean</i> of improvement."--<i>Blair's Rhet.</i>, p. 343. "And by <i>that</i> means <i>we have now an early prepossession in their favour."--</i>Ib.<i>, p. 348.</i> "To abolish all sacrifice by revealing a better <i>mean</i> of reconciliation." --<i>Keith's Evidences</i>, p. 46. "As a <i>mean</i> of destroying the distinction." --<i>Ib.</i>, p. 3. "Which however is by no <i>mean</i> universally the case."-- <i>Religious World Displayed</i>, Vol. iii, p. 155.</p>
<p>OBS. 35.--Again, there are some nouns, which, though they do not lack the regular plural form, are sometimes used in a plural sense without the plural termination. Thus <i>manner</i> makes the plural <i>manners</i>, which last is now generally used in the peculiar sense of behaviour, or deportment, but not always: it sometimes means methods, modes, or ways; as, "At sundry times and in divers <i>manners</i>."--<i>Heb.</i>, i, 1. "In the <i>manners</i> above mentioned."--<i>Butler's Analogy</i>, p. 100. "There be three <i>manners</i> of trials in England."--COWELL: <i>Joh. Dict., w. Jury</i>. "These two <i>manners</i> of representation."--<i>Lowth's Gram.</i>, p. 15. "These are the three primary modes, or <i>manners</i>, of expression."--<i>Lowth's Gram.</i>, p. 83. "In arrangement, too, various <i>manners</i> suit various styles."--<i>Campbell's</i> Phil. of Rhet.<i>, p. 172. "Between the two</i> manners<i>."--</i>Bolingbroke, on Hist.<i>, p. 35. "Here are three different</i> manners <i>of asserting."--</i> <i>Barnard's Gram.</i>, p. 59. But <i>manner</i> has often been put for <i>sorts</i>, without the <i>s</i>; as, "The tree of life, which bare <i>twelve manner</i> of fruits."--<i>Rev.</i>, xxii, 2. "All <i>manner</i> of men assembled here in arms."--<i>Shak</i>. "<i>All manner</i> of outward advantages."--<i>Atterbury</i>. Milton used <i>kind</i> in the same way, but not very properly; as, "<i>All kind</i> of living creatures."--<i>P. Lost</i>, B. iv, l. 286. This irregularity it would be well to avoid. <i>Manners</i> may still, perhaps, be proper for modes or ways; and <i>all manner</i>, if allowed, must be taken in the sense of a collective noun; but for sorts, kinds, classes, or species, I would use neither the plural nor the singular of this word. The word <i>heathen</i>, too, makes the regular plural <i>heathens</i>, and yet is often used in a plural sense without the <i>s</i>; as, "Why do the <i>heathen</i> rage?"--<i>Psalms</i>, ii, 1. "Christianity was formerly propagated among the <i>heathens</i>."--<i>Murray's Key</i>, 8vo, p. 217. The word <i>youth</i>, likewise, has the same peculiarities.</p>
<p>OBS. 36.--Under the present head come names of fishes, birds, or other things, when the application of the singular is extended from the individual to the species, so as to supersede the plural by assuming its construction: as, Sing. "A great <i>fish</i>."--<i>Jonah</i>, i, 17. Plur. "For the multitude of <i>fishes'</i>."--<i>John</i>, xxi, 6. "A very great multitude of <i>fish</i>."--<i>Ezekiel</i>, xlvii, 9.[157] The name of the genus being liable to this last construction, men seem to have thought that the species should follow; consequently, the regular plurals of some very common names of fishes are scarcely known at all. Hence some grammarians affirm, that <i>salmon, mackerel, herring, perch, tench</i>, and several others, are alike in both numbers, and ought never to be used in the plural form. I am not so fond of honouring these anomalies. Usage is here as unsettled, as it is arbitrary; and, if the expression of plurality is to be limited to either form exclusively, the regular plural ought certainly to be preferred. But, <i>for fish taken in bulk</i>, the singular form seems more appropriate; as, "These vessels take from thirty-eight to forty-five quintals of <i>cod</i> and <i>pollock</i>, and six thousand barrels of <i>mackerel</i>, yearly."--<i>Balbi's</i> Geog.<i>, p. 28.</i></p>
<p>OBS. 37.--The following examples will illustrate the unsettled usage just mentioned, and from them the reader may judge for himself what is right. In quoting, at second-hand, I generally think it proper to make double references; and especially in citing authorities after Johnson, because he so often gives the same passages variously. But he himself is reckoned good authority in things literary. Be it so. I regret the many proofs of his fallibility. "Hear you this Triton of the <i>minnows?</i>"--<i>Shak</i>. "The shoal of <i>herrings</i> was of an immense extent."--<i>Murray's Key</i>, p. 185. "Buy my <i>herring</i> fresh."--SWIFT: <i>in Joh. Dict.</i> "In the fisheries of Maine, <i>cod,</i> herring, mackerel alewives, salmon<i>, and other</i> fish<i>, are</i> taken."--<i>Balbi's Geog.</i>, p. 23. "MEASE, <i>n.</i> The quantity of 500; as, a <i>mease</i> of <i>herrings</i>."--<i>Webster's Dict.</i> "We shall have plenty of <i>mackerel</i> this season."--ADDISON: <i>in Joh. Dict.</i> "<i>Mackarel</i> is the same in both numbers. Gay has improperly <i>mackarels</i>."--<i>Churchill's Gram.</i>, p. 208. "They take <i>salmon</i> and <i>trouts</i> by groping and tickling them under the bellies."--CAREW: <i>in Joh. Dict.</i> "The pond will keep <i>trout</i> and <i>salmon</i> in their seasonable plight."--<i>Id., ib., w. Trout</i>. "Some <i>fish</i> are preserved fresh in vinegar, as <i>turbot</i>."--<i>Id., ib., w. Turbot</i>. "Some <i>fish</i> are boiled and preserved fresh in vinegar, as <i>tunny</i> and <i>turbot</i>."--<i>Id., ib., w. Tunny</i>. "Of round <i>fish</i>, there are <i>brit, sprat,</i> barn, smelts<i>."--</i>Id., ib., w. Smelt. <i>"For</i> sprats <i>and</i> spurlings <i>for</i> your house."--TUSSEE: <i>ib., w. Spurling</i>. "The coast is plentifully stored with <i>pilchards, herrings</i>, and <i>haddock</i>."--CAREW: <i>ib., w. Haddock</i>. "The coast is plentifully stored with round <i>fish, pilchard, herring, mackerel</i>, and <i>cod</i>"--<i>Id., ib., w. Herring</i>. "The coast is plentifully stored with <i>shellfish, sea-hedgehogs, scallops, pilcherd, herring</i>, and <i>pollock</i>."--<i>Id., ib., w. Pollock</i>. "A <i>roach</i> is <i>a fish</i> of no great reputation for his dainty taste. It is noted that <i>roaches</i> recover strength and grow a fortnight after spawning."--WALTON: <i>ib., w. Roach</i>. "A friend of mine stored a pond of three or four acres with <i>carps</i> and <i>tench</i>."--HALE: <i>ib., w. Carp</i>. "Having stored a very great pond with <i>carps, tench</i>, and other <i>pond-fish</i>, and only put in two small <i>pikes</i>, this pair of tyrants in seven years devoured the whole."--<i>Id., ib., w.</i> Tench<i>. "Singular,</i> tench<i>; plural,</i> tenches<i>."--</i>Brightland's Gram.<i>, p.</i> 78. "The polar bear preys upon <i>seals, fish</i>, and the carcasses of <i>whales</i>."--<i>Balbi's Geog.</i>, p. 172. "<i>Trouts</i> and <i>salmons</i> swim against the stream."--BACON: <i>Ward's Gram.</i>, p. 130.</p>
<pre>  "'Tis true no <i>turbots</i> dignify my boards,
   But <i>gudgeons, flounders</i>, what my Thames affords."--<i>Pope</i>.
</pre>
<p>OBS. 38.--Prom the foregoing examples it would seem, if fish or fishes are often spoken of without a regular distinction of the grammatical numbers, it is not because the words are not susceptible of the inflection, but because there is some difference of meaning between the mere name of the sort and the distinct modification in regard to number. There are also other nouns in which a like difference may be observed. Some names of building materials, as <i>brick, stone, plank, joist</i>, though not destitute of regular plurals, as <i>bricks, stones, planks, joists</i>, and not unadapted to ideas distinctly singular, as <i>a brick, a stone, a plank, a joist</i>, are nevertheless sometimes used in a plural sense without the <i>s</i>, and sometimes in a sense which seems hardly to embrace the idea of either number; as, "Let us make <i>brick</i>, and burn <i>them</i> thoroughly."--<i>Gen.</i>, xi, 3. "And they had <i>brick</i> for <i>stone</i>."--<i>Ib.</i> "The tale of <i>bricks</i>."--<i>Exod.</i>, v, 8 and 18. "Make <i>brick</i>."--<i>Ib.</i>, v, 16. "From your <i>bricks</i>."--<i>Ib.</i>, v, 19. "Upon altars of <i>brick</i>."--<i>Isaiah</i>. lxv, 3. "The <i>bricks</i> are fallen down."--<i>Ib.</i>, ix, 10. The same variety of usage occurs in respect to a few other words, and sometimes perhaps without good reason; as, "Vast numbers of sea <i>fowl</i> frequent the rocky cliffs."--<i>Balbi's</i> Geog.<i>, p. 231. "Bullocks, sheep, and</i> fowls<i>."--</i>Ib.<i>, p. 439. "</i>Cannon is used alike in both numbers."--<i>Everest's Gram.</i>, p. 48. "<i>Cannon</i> and <i>shot</i> may be used in the singular or plural sense."--<i>O. B. Peirce's</i> Gram.<i>, p. 37. "The column in the Place Vendome is one hundred and</i> thirty-four feet high, and is made of the brass of the <i>cannons</i> taken from the Austrians and Prussians."--<i>Balbi's Geog.</i>, p. 249. "As his <i>cannons</i> roar."--<i>Dryden's Poems</i>, p. 81. "Twenty <i>shot</i> of his greatest cannon."--CLARENDON: <i>Joh. Dict.</i> "Twenty <i>shots</i>" would here, I think, be more proper, though the word is not made plural when it means <i>little balls</i> of lead<i>. "And</i> cannons <i>conquer armies."--</i>Hudibras<i>, Part III, Canto iii,</i> l. 249.</p>

   Of <i>cannons</i> echoed from th' affrighted shore."--<i>Waller</i>, p. 7.
</pre>
<p>OBS. 39.--Of foreign nouns, many retain their original plural; a few are defective; and some are redundant, because the English form is also in use. Our writers have laid many languages under contribution, and thus furnished an abundance of irregular words, necessary to be explained, but never to be acknowledged as English till they conform to our own rules.</p>
<p>1. Of nouns in <i>a, saliva</i>, spittle, and <i>scoria</i>, dross, have no occasion for the plural; <i>lamina</i>, a thin plate, makes <i>laminæ</i>; <i>macula</i>, a spot, <i>maculæ</i>; <i>minutia</i>, a little thing, <i>minutiæ</i>; <i>nebula</i>, a mist, <i>nebulæ</i>; <i>siliqua</i>, a pod, <i>siliqiuæ</i>. <i>Dogma</i> makes <i>dogmas</i> or <i>dogmata</i>; <i>exanthema, exanthemas</i> or <i>exanthemata</i>; <i>miasm</i> or <i>miasma, miasms</i> or <i>miasmata</i>; <i>stigma, stigmas</i> or <i>stigmata</i>.</p>
<p>2. Of nouns in <i>um</i>, some have no need of the plural; as, <i>bdellium,</i> decorum, elysium, equilibrium, guaiacum, laudanum, odium, opium, petroleum, serum, viaticum<i>. Some form it regularly; as,</i> asylums, compendiums, craniums, emporiums, encomiums, forums, frustums, lustrums, mausoleums, museums, pendulums, nostrums, rostrums, residuums, vacuums<i>. Others take</i> either the English or the Latin plural; as, <i>desideratums</i> or <i>desiderata,</i> mediums <i>or</i> media, menstruums <i>or</i> menstrua, memorandums <i>or</i> memoranda, spectrums <i>or</i> spectra, speculums <i>or</i> specula, stratums <i>or</i> strata, succedaneums <i>or</i> succedanea, trapeziums <i>or</i> trapezia, vinculums <i>or</i> <i>vincula</i>. A few seem to have the Latin plural only: as, <i>arcanum, arcana;</i> datum, data; effluvium, effluvia; erratum, errata; scholium, scholia<i>.</i></p>
<p>3. Of nouns in <i>us</i>, a few have no plural; as, <i>asparagus, calamus, mucus</i>. Some have only the Latin plural, which usually changes <i>us</i> to <i>i</i>; as, <i>alumnus, alumni; androgynus, androgyni; calculus, calculi; dracunculus,</i> dracunculi; echinus, echini; magus, magi<i>. But such as have properly become</i> English words, may form the plural regularly in <i>es</i>; as, <i>chorus,</i> choruses<i>: so,</i> apparatus, bolus, callus, circus, fetus, focus, fucus, fungus, hiatus, ignoramus, impetus, incubus, isthmus, nautilus, nucleus, prospectus, rebus, sinus, surplus<i>. Five of these make the Latin plural</i> like the singular; but the mere English scholar has no occasion to be told which they are. <i>Radius</i> makes the plural <i>radii</i> or <i>radiuses</i>. <i>Genius</i> has <i>genii</i>, for imaginary spirits, and <i>geniuses</i>, for men of wit. <i>Genus</i>, a sort, becomes <i>genera</i> in Latin, and <i>genuses</i> in English. <i>Denarius</i> makes, in the plural, <i>denarii</i> or <i>denariuses</i>.</p>
<p>4. Of nouns in <i>is</i>, some are regular; as, <i>trellis, trellises</i>: so, <i>annolis, butteris, caddis, dervis, iris, marquis, metropolis, portcullis,</i> proboscis<i>. Some seem to have no need of the plural; as,</i> ambergris, aqua-fortis, arthritis, brewis, crasis, elephantiasis, genesis, orris, siriasis, tennis<i>. But most nouns of this ending follow the Greek or Latin</i> form, which simply changes <i>is</i> to <i>=es</i>: as, <i>amanuensis, amanuenses;</i> analysis, analyses; antithesis, antitheses; axis, axes; basis, bases; crisis, crises; diæresis, diæreses; diesis, dieses; ellipsis, ellipses; emphasis, emphases; fascis, fasces; hypothesis, hypotheses; metamorphosis, metamorphoses; oasis, oases; parenthesis, parentheses; phasis, phases; praxis, praxes; synopsis, synopses; synthesis, syntheses; syrtis, syrtes; thesis, theses<i>. In some, however, the original plural is not so formed;</i> but is made by changing <i>is</i> to <i>~ides</i>; as, <i>aphis, aphides; apsis,</i> apsides; ascaris, ascarides; bolis, bolides; cantharis, cantharides; chrysalis, chrysalides; ephemeris, ephemerides; epidermis, epidermides<i>. So</i> <i>iris</i> and <i>proboscis</i>, which we make regular; and perhaps some of the foregoing may be made so too. Fisher writes <i>Praxises</i> for <i>praxes</i>, though not very properly. See his <i>Gram</i>, p. v. <i>Eques</i>, a Roman knight, makes <i>equites</i> in the plural.</p>
<p>5. Of nouns in <i>x</i>, there are few, if any, which ought not to form the plural regularly, when used as English words; though the Latins changed <i>x</i> to <i>ces</i>, and <i>ex</i> to <i>ices</i>, making the <i>i</i> sometimes long and sometimes short: as, <i>apex, apices</i>, for <i>apexes; appendix, appendices</i>, for <i>appendixes; calix, calices</i>, for <i>calixes</i>; <i>calx, calces</i>, for <i>calxes;</i> calyx, calyces<i>, for</i> calyxes; caudex, caudices<i>, for</i> caudexes; cicatrix, cicatrices<i>, for</i> cicatrixes; helix, helices<i>, for</i> helixes; index, indices<i>, for</i> indexes; matrix, matrices<i>, for</i> matrixes; quincunx, quincunces<i>, for</i> quincunxes; radix, radices<i>, for</i> radixes; varix, varices<i>, for</i> varixes; vertex, vertices<i>, for</i> vertexes; vortex, vortices<i>, for</i> vortexes<i>. Some Greek words in</i> x <i>change that letter to</i> <i>ges</i>; as, <i>larynx, larynges</i>, for <i>larinxes; phalanx, phalanges</i>, for <i>phalanxes</i>. <i>Billet-doux</i>, from the French, is <i>billets-doux</i> in the plural.</p>
<p>6. Of nouns in <i>on</i>, derived from Greek, the greater part always form the plural regularly; as, <i>etymons, gnomons, ichneumons, myrmidons, phlegmons,</i> trigons, tetragons, pentagons, hexagons, heptagons, octagons, enneagons, decagons, hendecagons, dodecagons, polygons<i>. So</i> trihedrons, tetrahedrons, pentahedrons<i>, &amp;c., though some say, these last may end in</i> dra<i>, which I</i> think improper. For a few words of this class, however, there are double plurals in use; as, <i>automata</i> or <i>atomatons, criteria</i> or <i>criterions,</i> parhelia <i>or</i> parhelions<i>; and the plural of</i> phenomenon <i>appears to be</i> always <i>phenomena</i>.</p>
<p>7. The plural of <i>legumen</i> is <i>legumens</i> or <i>legumina</i>; of <i>stamen,</i> stamens <i>or</i> stamina<i>: of</i> cherub, cherubs <i>or</i> cherubim<i>; of</i> seraph, seraphs <i>or</i> seraphim<i>; of</i> beau, beaus <i>or</i> beaux<i>; of</i> bandit, bandits or <i>banditti</i>. The regular forms are in general preferable. The Hebrew plurals <i>cherubim</i> and <i>seraphim</i>, being sometimes mistaken for singulars, other plurals have been formed from them; as, "And over it the <i>cherubims</i> of glory."--<i>Heb</i>. ix, 5. "Then flow one of the <i>seraphims</i> unto me."--<i>Isaiah</i>, vi, 6. Dr. Campbell remarks: "We are authorized, both by use and by analogy, to say either <i>cherubs</i> and <i>seraphs</i>, according to the English idiom, or <i>cherubim</i> and <i>seraphim</i>, according to the oriental. The former suits better the familiar, the latter the solemn style. I shall add to this remark," says he, "that, as the words <i>cherubim</i> and <i>seraphim</i> are plural, the terms <i>cherubims</i> and <i>seraphims</i>, as expressing the plural, are quite improper."--<i>Phil. of Rhet.</i>, p. 201.</p>
<p>OBS. 40.--When other parts of speech become nouns, they either want the plural, or form it regularly,[158] like common nouns of the same endings; as, "His affairs went on at <i>sixes</i> and <i>sevens</i>."--<i>Arbuthnot</i>. "Some mathematicians have proposed to compute by <i>twoes</i>; <i>others</i>, by <i>fours</i>; <i>others</i>, by <i>twelves</i>."--<i>Churchill's Gram.</i>, p. 81. "Three <i>fourths</i>, nine <i>tenths</i>."--<i>Ib.</i>, p. 230. "Time's <i>takings</i> and <i>leavings</i>."-- <i>Barton</i>. "The <i>yeas</i> and <i>nays</i>."--<i>Newspaper</i>. "The <i>ays</i> and <i>noes</i>."--<i>Ib.</i> "<i>Oes</i> and <i>spangles</i>."--<i>Bacon</i>. "The <i>ins</i> and the <i>outs</i>."--<i>Newspaper</i>."--We find it more safe against <i>outs</i> and <i>doubles</i>."--<i>Printer's Gram.</i> "His <i>ands</i> and his <i>ors</i>."--<i>Mott</i>. "One of the <i>buts</i>."--<i>Fowle</i>. "In raising the mirth of <i>stupids</i>."--<i>Steele</i>. "<i>Eatings, drinkings, wakings, sleepings, walkings, talkings, sayings,</i> doings<i>--all were for the good of the public; there was not such a things</i> as a secret in the town."--LANDON: <i>Keepsake</i>, 1833. "Her innocent <i>forsooths</i> and <i>yesses</i>."--<i>Spect.</i>, No. 266.</p>

GENDERS.</p>
<p><br>
Genders, in grammar, are modifications that distinguish objects in regard to sex.</p>
<p>There are three genders; the <i>masculine</i>, the <i>feminine</i>, and the <i>neuter</i>.</p>
<p>The <i>masculine gender</i> is that which denotes persons or animals of the male kind; as, <i>man, father, king</i>.</p>
<p>The <i>feminine gender</i> is that which denotes persons or animals of the female kind; as, <i>woman, mother, queen</i>.</p>
<p>The <i>neuter gender</i> is that which denotes things that are neither male nor female; as, <i>pen, ink, paper</i>.</p>
<p>Hence, names of males are masculine; names of females, feminine; and names of things inanimate, literally, neuter.</p>
<p>Masculine nouns make regular feminines, when their termination is changed to <i>ess</i>: as, <i>hunter, huntress</i>; <i>prince, princess</i>; <i>lion, lioness</i>.</p>
<p><br>
OBSERVATIONS.</p>
<p>OBS. 1.--The different genders in grammar are founded on the natural distinction of sex in animals, and on the absence of sex in other things. In English, they belong only to nouns and pronouns; and to these they are usually applied, not arbitrarily, as in some other languages, but agreeably to the order of nature. From this we derive a very striking advantage over those who use the gender differently, or without such rule; which is, that our pronouns are easy of application, and have a fine effect when objects are personified. Pronouns are of the same gender as the nouns for which they stand.</p>
<p>OBS. 2.--Many nouns are equally applicable to both sexes; as, <i>cousin,</i> friend, neighbour, parent, person, servant<i>. The gender of these is usually</i> determined by the context; and they are to be called masculine or feminine accordingly. To such words, some grammarians have applied the unnecessary and improper term <i>common gender</i>. Murray justly observes, "There is no such gender belonging to the language. The business of parsing can be effectually performed, without having recourse to a <i>common</i> gender<i>."--</i>Gram.<i>, 8vo. p. 39. The term is more useful, and less liable to</i> objection, as applied to the learned languages; but with us, whose genders <i>distinguish objects in regard to sex</i>, it is plainly a solecism.</p>
<p>OBS. 3.--A great many of our grammars define gender to be "<i>the distinction</i> of sex<i>," and then speak of a</i> common gender<i>, in which the two sexes are</i> left <i>undistinguished</i>; and of the <i>neuter gender</i>, in which objects are treated as being of <i>neither sex</i>. These views of the matter are obviously inconsistent. Not genders, or a gender, do the writers undertake to define, but "gender" as a whole; and absurdly enough, too; because this whole of gender they immediately distribute into certain <i>other genders</i>, into genders of gender, or kinds of gender, and these not compatible with their definition. Thus Wells: "Gender is <i>the distinction</i> of objects, with regard to sex. There are four genders;--the <i>masculine</i>, the <i>feminine</i>, the <i>common</i>, and the <i>neuter</i>."--<i>School Gram.</i>, 1st Ed., p. 49. [Those] "Nouns which are applicable <i>alike to both sexes</i>, are of the <i>common</i> gender."--<i>Ib.</i> This then is manifestly no gender under the foregoing definition, and the term <i>neuter</i> is made somewhat less appropriate by the adoption of a third denomination before it. Nor is there less absurdity in the phraseology with which Murray proposes to avoid the recognition of the <i>common gender</i>: "Thus we may say, <i>Parents</i> is a noun of the <i>masculine</i> and feminine <i>gender;</i> Parent<i>, if doubtful, is of the</i> masculine or feminine <i>gender; and</i> Parent<i>, if the gender is known by the construction,</i> is of the gender so ascertained."--<i>Gram.</i>, 8vo, p. 39. According to this, we must have <i>five genders</i>, exclusive of that which is called <i>common</i>; namely, the <i>masculine</i>, the <i>feminine</i>, the <i>neuter</i>, the <i>androgynal</i>, and the <i>doubtful</i>.</p>
<p>OBS. 4.--It is plain that many writers on grammar have had but a confused notion of what a gender really is. Some of them, confounding gender with sex, deny that there are more than two genders, because there are only two sexes. Others, under a like mistake, resort occasionally, (as in the foregoing instance,) to an <i>androgynal</i>, and also to a <i>doubtful</i> gender: both of which are more objectionable than the <i>common gender</i> of the old grammarians; though this <i>common</i> "distinction with regard to sex," is, in our language, confessedly, no distinction at all. I assume, that there are in English the three genders, masculine, feminine, and neuter, and no more; and that every noun and every pronoun must needs be of some gender; consequently, of some one of these three. A gender is, literally, a sort, a kind, a sex. But genders, <i>in grammar</i>, are attributes of words, rather than of persons, or animals, or things; whereas sexes are attributes, not of words, but of living creatures. He who understands this, will perceive that the absence of sex in some things, is as good a basis for a grammatical distinction, as the presence or the difference of it in others; nor can it be denied, that the neuter, according to my definition, is a gender, is a distinction "in <i>regard</i> to sex," though it does not embrace either of the sexes. There are therefore three genders, and only three.</p>
<p>OBS. 5.--Generic names, even when construed as masculine or feminine, often virtually include both sexes; as, "Hast thou given <i>the horse</i> strength? hast thou clothed <i>his</i> neck with thunder? Canst thou make <i>him</i> afraid as a grasshopper? the glory of <i>his</i> nostrils is terrible."--<i>Job</i>, xxxix, 19. "Doth <i>the hawk</i> fly by thy wisdom, and stretch <i>her</i> wings toward the south? Doth <i>the eagle</i> mount up at thy command, and make <i>her</i> nest on high?"--<i>Ib.</i>, ver. 26. These were called, by the old grammarians, <i>epicene</i> nouns--that is, <i>supercommon</i>; but they are to be parsed each according to the gender of the pronoun which is put for it.</p>
<p>OBS. 6.--The gender of words, in many instances, is to be determined by the following principle of universal grammar. Those terms which are equally applicable to both sexes, (if they are not expressly applied to females,) and those plurals which are known to include both sexes, should be called masculine in parsing; for, in all languages, the masculine gender is considered the most worthy,[159] and is generally employed when both sexes are included under one common term. Thus <i>parents</i> is always masculine, and must be represented by a masculine pronoun, for the gender of a word is a property indivisible, and that which refers to the male sex, always takes the lead in such cases. If one say, "Joseph took <i>the young child and his</i> mother <i>by night, and fled with</i> them <i>into Egypt," the pronoun</i> them <i>will</i> be masculine; but let "<i>his</i>" be changed to <i>its</i>, and the plural pronoun that follows, will be feminine. For the feminine gender takes precedence of the neuter, but not of the masculine; and it is not improper to speak of a young child without designating the sex. As for such singulars as <i>parent,</i> friend, neighbour, thief, slave<i>, and many others, they are feminine when</i> expressly applied to any of the female sex; but otherwise, masculine.</p>
<p>OBS. 7.--Nouns of multitude, when they convey the idea of unity or take the plural form, are of the neuter gender; but when they convey the idea of plurality without the form, they follow the gender of the individuals which compose the assemblage. Thus a <i>congress</i>, a <i>council</i>, a <i>committee</i>, a <i>jury</i>, a <i>sort</i>, or a <i>sex</i>, if taken collectively, is neuter; being represented in discourse by the neuter pronoun <i>it</i>: and the formal plurals, <i>congresses, councils, committees, juries, sorts, sexes</i>, of course, are neuter also. But, if I say, "The committee disgraced <i>themselves</i>," the noun and pronoun are presumed to be masculine, unless it be known that I am speaking of a committee of females. Again: "The <i>fair</i> sex, whose <i>task is not to mingle in the labours of public life, have</i> <i>their</i> own part assigned <i>them</i> to act."--<i>Comly's Gram.</i>, p. 132. Here <i>sex</i>, and the three pronouns which have that word for their antecedent, are all feminine. Again: "<i>Each sex</i>, dressing <i>themselves</i> in the clothes of the other."--<i>Wood's Dictionary</i>, v. <i>Feast of Purim</i>. Here <i>sex</i>, and the pronoun which follows, are masculine; because, the male sex, as well as the female, is here spoken of plurally.</p>
<p>OBS. 8.--To <i>persons</i>, of every description, known or unknown, real or imaginary, we uniformly ascribe sex.[160] But, as personality implies intelligence, and sex supposes some obvious difference, a <i>young child</i> may be spoken of with distinction of sex or without, according to the notion of the speaker; as, "I went to see the <i>child</i> whilst they were putting on <i>its cloaths</i>."--<i>Priestley's Gram.</i>, p. 125. "Because the <i>child</i> has no idea of any nurse besides <i>his</i> own."--<i>Ib.</i>, p. 153. To <i>brute animals</i> also, the same distinction is generally applied, though with less uniformity. Some that are very small, have a gender which seems to be merely occasional and figurative; as, "Go to the <i>ant</i>, thou sluggard; consider <i>her</i> ways, and be wise."--<i>Prov.</i>, vi, 6. "The <i>spider</i> taketh hold with <i>her</i> hands, and is in kings' palaces."--<i>Prov.</i>, xxx, 28. So the <i>bee</i> is usually made feminine, being a little creature of admirable industry and economy. But, in general, irrational creatures whose sex is unknown, or unnecessary to be regarded, are spoken of as neuter; as, "And it became a <i>serpent</i>; and Moses fled from before <i>it</i>. And the Lord said unto Moses, Put forth thine hand, and take <i>it</i> by the tail. And he put forth his hand and caught <i>it</i>, and <i>it</i> became a rod in his hand."--<i>Exod.</i>, iv, 3, 4. Here, although the word <i>serpent</i> is sometimes masculine, the neuter pronoun seems to be more proper. So of some imaginary creatures: as, "<i>Phenix</i>, the fowl which is said to exist single, and to rise again from <i>its</i> own ashes."--<i>Webster's Dict.</i> "So shall the <i>Phoenix</i> escape, with no stain on <i>its</i> plumage."--<i>Dr. Bartlett's Lect.</i>, p. 10.</p>
<p>OBS. 9.--But this liberty of representing animals as of no sex, is often carried to a very questionable extent; as, "The <i>hare</i> sleeps with <i>its</i> eyes open."--<i>Barbauld</i>. "The <i>hedgehog</i>, as soon as <i>it</i> perceives <i>itself</i> attacked, rolls <i>itself</i> into a kind of ball, and presents nothing but <i>its</i> prickles to the foe."--<i>Blair's Reader</i>, p. 138. "The <i>panther</i> is a ferocious creature: like the tiger <i>it</i> seizes <i>its</i> prey by surprise."--<i>Ib.</i>, p. 102. "The <i>leopard</i>, in <i>its</i> chace of prey, spares neither man nor beast."--<i>Ib.</i>, p. 103. "If a man shall steal an <i>ox</i>, or a <i>sheep</i>, and kill <i>it</i>, or sell <i>it</i>."--<i>Exod.</i>, xxii, 1. "A <i>dog</i> resists <i>its</i> instinct to run after a hare, because <i>it</i> recollects the beating <i>it</i> has previously received on that account. The <i>horse</i> avoids the stone at which <i>it</i> once has stumbled."--<i>Spurzheim, on Education</i>, p. 3. "The <i>racehorse</i> is looked upon with pleasure; but it is the <i>warhorse</i>, that carries grandeur in <i>its</i> idea."--<i>Blair's Rhet.</i>, p. 30.</p>
<p>OBS. 10.--The sexes are distinguished <i>by words</i>, in four different ways. First, by the use of different terminations: as, <i>Jew, Jewess; Julius,</i> Julia; hero, heroine<i>. Secondly, by the use of entirely different names:</i> as, <i>Henry, Mary; king, queen</i>. Thirdly, by compounds or phrases including some distinctive term: as, <i>Mr. Murray, Mrs. Murray; Englishman,</i> Englishwoman; grandfather, grandmother; landlord, landlady; merman, mermaid; servingman, servingmaid; man-servant, maid-servant; schoolmaster, schoolmistress; school-boy, school-girl; peacock, peahen; cock-sparrow, hen-sparrow; he-goat, she-goat; buck-rabbit, doe-rabbit; male elephant, female elephant; male convicts, female convicts<i>. Fourthly, by the pronouns</i> <i>he, his, him</i>, put for nouns masculine; and <i>she, her, hers</i>, for nouns feminine: as, "Ask <i>him</i> that fleeth, and <i>her</i> that escapeth, and say, What is done?"--<i>Jer.</i>, xlviii, 19.</p>
<pre>  "O happy <i>peasant!</i> Oh unhappy <i>bard!</i>
   <i>His</i> the mere tinsel, <i>hers</i> the rich reward."--<i>Cowper</i>.
</pre>
<p>OBS. 11.--For feminine nouns formed by inflection, the regular termination is <i>ess</i>; but the manner in which this ending is applied to the original or masculine noun, is not uniform:--</p>
<p>1. In some instances the syllable <i>ess</i> is simply added: as, <i>accuser,</i> accuseress; advocate, advocatess; archer, archeress; author, authoress; avenger, avengeress; barber, barberess; baron, baroness; canon, canoness; cit, cittess;[161] coheir, coheiress; count, countess; deacon, deaconess; demon, demoness; diviner, divineress; doctor, doctoress; giant, giantess; god, goddess; guardian, guardianess; Hebrew, Hebrewess; heir, heiress; herd, herdess; hermit, hermitess; host, hostess; Jesuit, Jesuitess; Jew, Jewess; mayor, mayoress; Moabite, Moabitess; monarch, monarchess; pape, papess<i>; or,</i> pope, popess; patron, patroness; peer, peeress; poet, poetess; priest, priestess; prior, prioress; prophet, prophetess; regent, regentess; saint, saintess; shepherd, shepherdess; soldier, soldieress; tailor, tailoress; viscount, viscountess; warrior, warrioress<i>.</i></p>
<p>2. In other instances, the termination is changed, and there is no increase of syllables: as, <i>abbot, abbess; actor, actress; adulator, adulatress;</i> adulterer, adulteress; adventurer, adventuress; advoutrer, advoutress; ambassador, ambassadress; anchorite, anchoress<i>; or,</i> anachoret, anachoress; arbiter, arbitress; auditor, auditress; benefactor, benefactress; caterer, cateress; chanter, chantress; cloisterer, cloisteress; commander, commandress; conductor, conductress; creator, creatress; demander, demandress; detractor, detractress; eagle, eagless; editor, editress; elector, electress; emperor, emperess<i>, or</i> empress; emulator, emulatress; enchanter, enchantress; exactor, exactress; fautor, fautress; fornicator, fornicatress; fosterer, fosteress<i>, or</i> fostress; founder, foundress; governor, governess; huckster, huckstress<i>; or,</i> <i>hucksterer, hucksteress; idolater, idolatress; inhabiter, inhabitress;</i> instructor, instructress; inventor, inventress; launderer, launderess<i>, or</i> <i>laundress; minister, ministress; monitor, monitress; murderer, murderess;</i> negro, negress; offender, offendress; ogre, ogress; porter, portress; progenitor, progenitress; protector, protectress; proprietor, proprietress; pythonist, pythoness; seamster, seamstress; solicitor, solicitress; songster, songstress; sorcerer, sorceress; suitor, suitress; tiger, tigress; traitor, traitress; victor, victress; votary, votaress<i>.</i></p>
<p>3. In a few instances the feminine is formed as in Latin, by changing <i>or</i> to <i>rix</i>; but some of these have also the regular form, which ought to be preferred: as, <i>adjutor, adjutrix; administrator, administratrix;</i> arbitrator, arbitratrix; coadjutor, coadjutrix; competitor, competitress<i>,</i> or <i>competitrix; creditor, creditrix; director, directress</i>, or <i>directrix;</i> executor, executress<i>, or</i> executrix; inheritor, inheritress<i>, or</i> <i>inheritrix; mediator, mediatress</i>, or <i>mediatrix; orator, oratress</i>, or <i>oratrix; rector, rectress</i>, or <i>rectrix; spectator, spectatress</i>, or <i>spectatrix; testator, testatrix; tutor, tutoress</i>, or <i>tutress</i>, or <i>tutrix; deserter, desertress</i>, or <i>desertrice</i>, or <i>desertrix</i>.</p>
<p>4. The following are irregular words, in which the distinction of sex is chiefly made by the termination: <i>amoroso, amorosa: archduke, archduchess;</i> chamberlain, chambermaid; duke, duchess; gaffer, gammer; goodman, goody; hero, heroine; landgrave, landgravine; margrave, margravine; marquis, marchioness; palsgrave, palsgravine; sakeret, sakerhawk; sewer, sewster; sultan, sultana; tzar, tzarina; tyrant, tyranness; widower, widow<i>.</i></p>
<p>OBS. 12.--The proper names of persons almost always designate their sex; for it has been found convenient to make the names of women different from those of men. We have also some appellatives which correspond to each other, distinguishing the sexes by their distinct application to each: as, <i>bachelor, maid; beau, belle; boy, girl; bridegroom, bride; brother,</i> sister; buck, doe; boar, sow; bull, cow; cock, hen; colt, filly; dog, bitch; drake, duck; earl, countess; father, mother; friar, nun; gander, goose; grandsire, grandam; hart, roe; horse, mare; husband, wife; king, queen; lad, lass; lord, lady; male, female; man, woman; master, mistress<i>;</i> Mister, Missis; (Mr., Mrs.;) <i>milter, spawner; monk, nun; nephew, niece;</i> papa, mamma; rake, jilt; ram, ewe; ruff, reeve; sire, dam; sir, madam; sloven, slut; son, daughter; stag, hind; steer, heifer; swain, nymph; uncle, aunt; wizard, witch; youth, damsel; young man, maiden<i>.</i></p>
<p>OBS. 13.--The people of a particular country are commonly distinguished by some name derived from that of their country; as, <i>Americans, Africans,</i> Egyptians, Russians, Turks<i>. Such words are sometimes called</i> gentile names<i>. There are also adjectives, of the same origin, if not the same</i> form, which correspond with them. "Gentile names are for the most part considered as masculine, and the feminine is denoted by the gentile adjective and the noun <i>woman</i>: as, a <i>Spaniard</i>, a <i>Spanish woman</i>; a <i>Pole</i>, or <i>Polander</i>, a <i>Polish woman</i>. But, in a few instances, we always use a compound of the adjective with <i>man</i> or <i>woman</i>: as, an <i>Englishman</i>, an <i>Englishwoman</i>; a <i>Welshman</i>, a <i>Welshwoman</i>; an <i>Irishman</i>, an <i>Irishwoman</i>; a <i>Frenchman</i>, a <i>Frenchwoman</i>; a <i>Dutchman</i>, a <i>Dutchwoman</i>: and in these cases the adjective is employed as the collective noun; as, <i>the Dutch, the French</i>, &amp;c. A <i>Scotchman</i>, and a <i>Scot</i>, are both in use; but the latter is not common in prose writers: though some employ it, and these generally adopt the plural, <i>Scots</i>, with the definite article, as the collective term."--<i>Churchill's New Gram.</i>, p. 70.</p>
<p>OBS. 14.--The names of things without life, used literally, are always of the neuter gender: as, "When Cleopatra fled, Antony pursued her in a five-oared galley; and, coming along side of her <i>ship</i>, entered <i>it</i> without being seen by her."--<i>Goldsmith's Rome</i>, p. 160. "The <i>sun</i>, high as <i>it</i> is, has <i>its</i> business assigned; and so have the stars."--<i>Collier's Antoninus</i>, p. 138. But inanimate objects are often represented figuratively as having sex. Things remarkable for power, greatness, or sublimity, are spoken of as masculine; as, the <i>sun, time,</i> death, sleep, fear, anger, winter, war<i>. Things beautiful, amiable, or</i> prolific, are spoken of as feminine; as, a <i>ship</i>, the <i>moon</i>, the <i>earth,</i> nature, fortune, knowledge, hope, spring, peace<i>. Figurative gender is</i> indicated only by the personal pronouns of the singular number: as, "When we say of the <i>sun, He</i> is setting; or of a <i>ship, She</i> sails well."--<i>L.</i> Murray<i>. For these two objects, the</i> sun <i>and a</i> ship<i>, this phraseology is</i> so common, that the literal construction quoted above is rarely met with.</p>
<p>OBS. 15.--When any inanimate object or abstract quality is distinctly personified, and presented to the imagination in the character of a living and intelligent being, there is necessarily a change of the gender of the word; for, whenever personality is thus ascribed to what is literally neuter, there must be an assumption of one or the other sex: as, "<i>The</i> Genius of Liberty <i>is awakened, and springs up;</i> she <i>sheds her divine</i> light and creative powers upon the two hemispheres. A great <i>nation</i>, astonished at seeing <i>herself</i> free, stretches <i>her</i> arms from one extremity of the earth to the other, and embraces the first nation that became so."--<i>Abbé Fauchet</i>. But there is an inferior kind of personification, or of what is called such, in which, so far as appears, the gender remains neuter: as, "The following is an instance of personification and apostrophe united: 'O <i>thou sword</i> of the Lord! how long will it be ere <i>thou</i> be quiet? put <i>thyself</i> up into <i>thy</i> scabbard, rest, and be still! How can <i>it</i> be quiet, seeing the Lord hath given <i>it</i> a charge against Askelon, and against the sea-shore? there hath he appointed <i>it</i>.'"--<i>Murray's Gram.</i>, p. 348. See <i>Jer.</i>, xlvii, 6.</p>
<p>OBS. 16.--If what is called personification, does not always imply a change of gender and an ascription of sex, neither does a mere ascription of sex to what is literally of no sex, necessarily imply a personification; for there may be sex without personality, as we see in brute animals. Hence the gender of a brute animal personified in a fable, may be taken literally as before; and the gender which is figuratively ascribed to the <i>sun</i>, the <i>moon</i>, or a <i>ship</i>, is merely metaphorical. In the following sentence, <i>nature</i> is animated and made feminine by a metaphor, while a lifeless object bearing the name of <i>Venus</i>, is spoken of as neuter: "Like that conceit of old, which declared that the <i>Venus of Gnidos</i> was not the work of Praxiteles, since <i>nature herself</i> had concreted the boundary surface of <i>its</i> beauty."--<i>Rush, on the Voice</i>, p. xxv.</p>
<p>OBS. 17.--"In personifications regard must be had to propriety in determining the gender. Of most of the passions and moral qualities of man the ancients formed deities, as they did of various other things: and, when these are personified, they are usually made male or female, according as they were gods or goddesses in the pagan mythology. The same rule applies in other cases: and thus the planet Jupiter will be masculine; Venus, feminine: the ocean, <i>Oce=anus</i>, masculine: rivers, months, and winds, the same: the names of places, countries, and islands, feminine."--<i>Churchill's</i> Gram.<i>, p. 71.</i></p>
<p>OBS. 18.--These suggestions are worthy of consideration, but, for the gender which ought to be adopted in personifications, there seems to be no absolute general rule, or none which English writers have observed with much uniformity. It is well, however, to consider what is most common in each particular case, and abide by it. In the following examples, the sex ascribed is not that under which these several objects are commonly figured; for which reason, the sentences are perhaps erroneous:--</p>
<pre>  "<i>Knowledge</i> is proud that <i>he</i> has learn'd so much;
   <i>Wisdom</i> is humble that <i>he</i> knows no more."--<i>Cowper</i>.
</pre>
<pre>   "But hoary <i>Winter</i>, unadorned and bare,
   Dwells in the dire retreat, and freezes there;
   There <i>she</i> assembles all her blackest storms,
   And the rude hail in rattling tempests forms."--<i>Addison</i>.

CASES.</p>
<p>Cases, in grammar, are modifications that distinguish the relations of nouns or pronouns to other words.</p>
<p>There are three cases; the <i>nominative</i>, the <i>possessive</i>, and the <i>objective</i>.</p>
<p>The <i>nominative case</i> is that form or state of a noun or pronoun, which usually denotes the subject of a finite verb: as, The <i>boy</i> runs; <i>I</i> run.</p>
<p>The subject of a finite verb is that which answers to <i>who</i> or <i>what</i> before it; as, "The boy runs."--<i>Who</i> runs? "The <i>boy</i>." Boy is therefore here in the <i>nominative</i> case.</p>
<p>The <i>possessive case</i> is that form or state of a noun or pronoun, which usually denotes the relation of property: as, The <i>boy's</i> hat; <i>my</i> hat.</p>
<p>The possessive case of nouns is formed, in the singular number, by adding to the nominative <i>s preceded by an apostrophe</i>; and, in the plural, when the nominative ends in <i>s</i>, by adding <i>an apostrophe only</i>: as, singular, <i>boy's</i>; plural, <i>boys'</i>;--sounded alike, but written differently.</p>
<p>The <i>objective case</i> is that form or state of a noun or pronoun which usually denotes the object of a verb, participle, or preposition: as, I know the <i>boy</i>, having seen <i>him</i> at <i>school</i>; and he knows <i>me</i>.</p>
<p>The object of a verb, participle, or preposition, is that which answers to <i>whom</i> or <i>what</i> after it; as, "I know the boy."--I know <i>whom</i>? "The boy." <i>Boy</i> is therefore here in the <i>objective</i> case.</p>
<p>The nominative and the objective of nouns, are always alike in form, being distinguishable from each other only by their place in a sentence, or by their simple dependence according to the sense.</p>
<p><br>
OBSERVATIONS.</p>
<p>OBS. 1.--The cases, in grammar, are founded on the different relations under which things are represented in discourse; and from which the words acquire correspondent relations; or connexions and dependences according to the sense. In Latin, there are six cases; and in Greek, five. Consequently, the nouns and pronouns of those languages, and also their adjectives and participles, (which last are still farther inflected by the three genders,) are varied by many different terminations unknown to our tongue. In English, those modifications or relations which we call cases, belong only to nouns and pronouns; nor are there ever more than three. Pronouns are not necessarily like their antecedents in case.</p>
<p>OBS. 2.--Because the infinitive mood, a phrase, or a sentence, may in some instances be made the subject of a verb, so as to stand in that relation in which the nominative case is most commonly found; very many of our grammarians have deliberately represented all terms used in this manner, as being "<i>in the nominative case</i>:" as if, to sustain any one of the relations which are usually distinguished by a particular case, must necessarily constitute that modification itself. Many also will have participles, infinitives, phrases, and sentences, to be occasionally "<i>in</i> the objective case<i>:" whereas it must be plain to every reader, that they</i> are, all of them, <i>indeclinable</i> terms; and that, if used in any relation common to nouns or pronouns, they assume that office, as participles, as infinitives, as phrases, or as sentences, and not as <i>cases</i>. They no more take the nature of cases, than they become nouns or pronouns. Yet Nixon, by assuming that <i>of</i>, with the word governed by it, constitutes a <i>possessive</i> case<i>, contrives to give to participles, and even to the infinitive mood,</i> <i>all three of the cases</i>. Of the infinitive, he says, "An examination of the first and second methods of parsing this mood, must naturally lead to the inference that <i>it is a substantive</i>; and that, if it has the nominative case, it must also have the possessive and objective cases of a substantive. The fourth method proves its [capacity of] being in the possessive case: thus, 'A desire <i>to learn</i>;' that is, '<i>of learning</i>.' When it follows a participle, or a verb, as by the fifth or [the] seventh method, it is in the objective case. Method sixth is analogous to the Case Absolute of a substantive."--<i>Nixon's Parser</i>, p. 83. If the infinitive mood is really a <i>declinable substantive</i>, none of our grammarians have placed it in the right chapter; except that bold contemner of all grammatical and literary authority, Oliver B. Peirce. When will the cause of learning cease to have assailants and underminers among those who profess to serve it? Thus every new grammatist, has some grand absurdity or other, peculiar to himself; and what can be more gross, than to talk of English infinitives and participles as being in the <i>possessive case</i>?</p>
<p>OBS. 3.--It was long a subject of dispute among the grammarians, what number of cases an English noun should be supposed to have. Some, taking the Latin language for their model, and turning certain phrases into cases to fill up the deficits, were for having <i>six</i> in each number; namely, the nominative, the genitive, the dative, the accusative, the vocative, and the ablative. Others, contending that a case in grammar could be nothing else than a terminational inflection, and observing that English nouns have but one case that differs from the nominative in form, denied that there were more than two, the nominative and the possessive. This was certainly an important question, touching a fundamental principle of our grammar; and any erroneous opinion concerning it, might well go far to condemn the book that avouched it. Every intelligent teacher must see this. For what sense could be made of parsing, without supposing an objective case to nouns? or what propriety could there be in making the words, <i>of</i>, and <i>to</i>, and <i>from</i>, govern or compose three different cases? Again, with what truth can it be said, that nouns have <i>no cases</i> in English? or what reason can be assigned for making more than three?</p>
<p>OBS. 4.--Public opinion is now clear in the decision, that it is <i>expedient</i> to assign to English nouns three cases, and no more; and, in a matter of this kind, what is expedient for the purpose of instruction, is right. Yet, from the works of our grammarians, may be quoted every conceivable notion, right or wrong, upon this point. Cardell, with Tooke and Gilchrist on his side, contends that English nouns have <i>no cases</i>. Brightland averred that they have neither cases nor genders.[162] Buchanan, and the author of the old British Grammar, assigned to them <i>one</i> case only, the possessive, or genitive. Dr. Adam also says, "In English, nouns have <i>only one case</i>, namely, the genitive, or possessive case."--<i>Latin</i> and Eng. Gram.<i>, p. 7. W. B. Fowle has two cases, but rejects the word</i> <i>case</i>: "We use the simple term <i>agent</i> for a <i>noun that acts</i>, and <i>object</i> for the object of an action."--<i>Fowle's True Eng. Gram.</i>, Part II, p. 68. Spencer too discards the word <i>case</i>, preferring "<i>form</i>," that he may merge in one the nominative and the objective, giving to nouns <i>two</i> cases, but neither of these. "Nouns have <i>two Forms</i>, called the <i>Simple</i> and [the] <i>Possessive</i>."--<i>Spencer's E. Gram.</i>, p. 30. Webber's Grammar, published at Cambridge in 1832, recognizes but <i>two</i> cases of nouns, declaring the objective to be "altogether superfluous."--P. 22. "Our substantives have no more cases than two."--<i>Jamieson's Rhet.</i>, p. 14. "A Substantive doth not properly admit of more than two cases: the Nominative, and the Genitive."--<i>Ellen Devis's Gram.</i>, p. 19. Dr. Webster, in his Philosophical Grammar, of 1807, and in his Improved Grammar, of 1831, teaches the same doctrine, but less positively. This assumption has also had the support of Lowth, Johnson, Priestley, Ash, Bicknell, Fisher, Dalton, and our celebrated Lindley Murray.[163] In Child's or Latham's English Grammar, 1852, it is said, "The cases in the present English are three:--1. Nominative; 2. Objective; 3. Possessive." But this seems to be meant of pronouns only; for the next section affirms, "The <i>substantives</i> in English <i>have only two</i> out of the three cases."--See pp. 79 and 80. Reckless of the current usage of grammarians, and even of self-consistency, both author and reviser will have no objective case of nouns, because this is like the nominative; yet, finding an objective set after "the adjective <i>like</i>," they will recognize it as "<i>a dative</i> still existing in English!"--See p. 156. Thus do they forsake their own enumeration of cases, as they had before, in all their declensions, forsaken the new order in which they had at first so carefully set them!</p>
<p>OBS. 5.--For the <i>true</i> doctrine of <i>three</i> cases, we have the authority of Murray, in his later editions; of Webster, in his "Plain and Comp. Grammar, grounded on <i>True Principles</i>," 1790; also in his "Rudiments of English Grammar," 1811; together with the united authority of Adams, Ainsworth, Alden, Alger, Bacon, Barnard, Bingham, Burr, Bullions, Butler, Churchill, Chandler, Cobbett, Cobbin, Comly, Cooper, Crombie, Davenport, Davis, Fisk, A. Flint, Frost, Guy, Hart, Hiley, Hull, Ingersoll, Jaudon, Kirkham, Lennie, Mack, M'Culloch, Maunder, Merchant, Nixon, Nutting, John Peirce, Perley, Picket, Russell, Smart, R. C. Smith, Rev. T. Smith, Wilcox, and I know not how many others.</p>
<p>OBS. 6.--Dearborn, in 1795, recognized <i>four</i> cases: "the nominative, the possessive, the objective, and the absolute."--<i>Columbian Gram.</i>, pp. 16 and 20. Charles Bucke, in his work misnamed "A Classical Grammar of the English Language," published in London in 1829, asserts, that, "Substantives in English do not vary their terminations;" yet he gives them <i>four</i> cases; "the nominative, the genitive, the accusative, and the vocative." So did Allen, in a grammar much more classical, dated, London, 1813. Hazen, in 1842, adopted "four cases; namely, the nominative, the possessive, the objective, and the independent."--<i>Hazen's Practical</i> Gram.<i>, p. 35. Mulligan, since, has chosen these four: "Nominative,</i> Genitive, Dative, Accusative."--<i>Structure of E. Lang.</i>, p. 185. And yet his case after <i>to</i> or <i>for</i> is <i>not</i> "<i>dative</i>," but "<i>accusative!</i>"-- <i>Ib.</i>, p. 239. So too, Goodenow, of Maine, makes the cases four: "the <i>subjective</i>,[164] the <i>possessive</i>, the <i>objective</i>, and the <i>absolute</i>."--<i>Text-Book</i>, p. 31. Goldsbury, of Cambridge, has also four: "the Nominative, the Possessive, the Objective, and the Vocative."--<i>Com.</i> S. Gram.<i>, p. 13. Three other recent grammarians,--Wells, of Andover,--</i> Weld, of Portland,--and Clark, of Bloomfield, N. Y.,--also adopt "<i>four</i> cases;--the <i>nominative</i>, the <i>possessive</i>, the <i>objective</i>, and the <i>independent</i>."--<i>Wells's Gram.</i>, p. 57; <i>Weld's</i>, 60; <i>Clark's</i>, 49. The first of these gentlemen argues, that, "Since a noun or pronoun, used <i>independently</i>, cannot at the same time be employed as 'the subject of a verb,' there is a manifest impropriety in regarding it as a <i>nominative</i>." It might as well be urged, that a nominative after a verb, or in apposition with an other, is, for this reason, not a <i>nominative</i>. He also cites this argument: "'Is there not as much difference between the <i>nominative</i> and [the] <i>independent</i> case, as there is between the <i>nominative</i> and [the] <i>objective?</i> If so, why class them together as <i>one</i> case?'--<i>S. R.</i> Hall<i>."--</i>Wells's School Gram.<i>, p. 51. To this I answer, No. "The</i> nominative is that case which <i>primely denotes the name</i> of any person or thing;" (<i>Burn's Gram.</i>, p. 36;) and <i>this only</i> it is, that can be absolute, or independent, in English. This scheme of four cases is, in fact, a grave innovation. As authority for it, Wells cites Felton; and bids his readers, "See also Kennion, Parkhurst, Fowle, Flint, Goodenow, Buck, Hazen, Goldsbury, Chapin, S. Alexander, and P. Smith."--Page 57. But is the fourth case of these authors <i>the same</i> as his? Is it a case which "has usually the nominative form," but admits occasionally of "<i>me</i>" and "<i>him</i>," and embraces objective nouns of "<i>time, measure, distance,</i> direction<i>, or</i> place<i>?" No. Certainly one half of them, and probably more,</i> give little or no countenance to <i>such</i> an independent case as he has adopted. Parkhurst admitted but three cases; though he thought <i>two others</i> "might be an improvement." What Fowle has said in support of Wells's four cases, I have sought with diligence, and not found. Felton's "independent case" is only what he absurdly calls, "<i>The noun or pronoun addressed</i>."-- Page 91. Bucke and Goldsbury acknowledge "<i>the nominative case absolute</i>;" and none of the twelve, so far as I know, admit any objective word, or what others call objective, to be independent or absolute, except perhaps Goldsbury.</p>
<p>OBS. 7.--S. R. Hall, formerly principal of the Seminary for Teachers at Andover, (but no great grammarian,) in 1832, published a manual, called "The Grammatical Assistant;" in which he says, "There are <i>at least five</i> cases<i>, belonging to English nouns, differing as much from</i> each <i>other, as</i> the cases of Latin and Greek nouns. They may be called Nominative, Possessive, Objective, Independent and Absolute."--P. 7. O. B. Peirce will have both nouns and pronouns to be used in <i>five cases</i>, which he thus enumerates: "Four simple cases; the Subjective, Possessive, Objective, and the Independent; and the Twofold case."--<i>Gram.</i>, p. 42. But, on page 56th, he speaks of a "twofold <i>subjective</i> case," "the twofold <i>objective</i> case," and shows how the <i>possessive</i> may be twofold also; so that, without taking any of the Latin cases, or even all of Hall's, he really recognizes as many as seven, if not eight. Among the English grammars which assume all the <i>six cases</i> of the Latin Language, are Burn's, Coar's, Dilworth's, Mackintosh's, Mennye's, Wm. Ward's, and the "Comprehensive Grammar," a respectable little book, published by Dobson of Philadelphia, in 1789, but written by somebody in England.</p>
<p>OBS. 8.--Of the English grammars which can properly be said to be <i>now in</i> use<i>, a very great majority agree in ascribing to nouns three cases, and</i> three only. This, I am persuaded, is the best number, and susceptible of the best defence, whether we appeal to authority, or to other argument. The disputes of grammarians make no small part of the <i>history of grammar</i>; and in submitting to be guided by their decisions, it is proper for us to consider what <i>degree of certainty</i> there is in the rule, and what difference or concurrence there is among them: for, the teaching of any other than the best opinions, is not the teaching of science, come from what quarter it may. On the question respecting the objective case of nouns, Murray and Webster <i>changed sides with each other</i>; and that, long after they first appeared as grammarians. Nor was this the only, or the most important instance, in which the different editions of the works of these two gentlemen, present them in opposition, both to themselves and to each other. "What cases are there in English? The <i>nominative</i>, which usually stands before a verb; as, the <i>boy</i> writes: The <i>possessive</i>, which takes an <i>s</i> with a <i>comma</i>, and denotes property; as, <i>John's</i> hat: The <i>objective</i>, which follows a verb or preposition; as, he honors <i>virtue</i>, or it is an honor to <i>him</i>."--<i>Webster's Plain and Comp. Gram., Sixth</i> Edition<i>, 1800, p. 9. "But for convenience, the two positions of nouns, one</i> <i>before</i>, the other <i>after</i> the verb, are called <i>cases</i>. There are then three cases, the <i>nominative, possessive</i>, and <i>objective</i>."--<i>Webster's</i> Rudiments of Gram.<i>, 1811, p. 12. "In English therefore names have two</i> cases only, the <i>nominative</i> or simple name, and the <i>possessive</i>."-- <i>Webster's Philosoph. Gram.</i>, 1807, p. 32: also his <i>Improved Gram.</i>, 1831, p. 24.</p>
<p>OBS. 9.--Murray altered his opinion after the tenth or eleventh edition of his duodecimo Grammar. His instructions stand thus: "In English, substantives have but two cases, the nominative, and [the] possessive or genitive."--<i>Murray's Gram. 12mo, Second Edition</i>, 1796, p. 35. "For the assertion, that there are in English but two cases of nouns, and three of pronouns, we have the authority of Lowth, Johnson, Priestley, &amp;c. <i>names</i> which are sufficient <i>to decide this point."--</i>Ib.<i>, p. 36. "In English,</i> substantives have three cases, the nominative, the possessive, and the objective."--<i>Murray's Gram., 12mo, Twenty-third Edition</i>, 1816, p. 44. "The author of this work <i>long doubted</i> the propriety of assigning to English substantives an <i>objective case</i>: but a renewed critical examination of the subject; an examination to which he was prompted by the extensive and increasing demand for the grammar, has produced in his mind <i>a full persuasion</i>, that the nouns of our language are entitled to this comprehensive objective case."--<i>Ib.</i>, p. 46. If there is any credit in changing one's opinions, it is, doubtless, in changing them for the better; but, of all authors, a grammarian has the most need critically to examine his subject before he goes to the printer. "This case was adopted in the <i>twelfth edition</i> of the Grammar."--<i>Murray's Exercises</i>, 12mo, N. Y., 1818, p. viii.</p>
<p>OBS. 10.--The <i>possessive case</i> has occasioned no less dispute than the objective. On this vexed article of our grammar, custom has now become much more uniform than it was a century ago; and public opinion may be said to have settled most of the questions which have been agitated about it. Some individuals, however, are still dissatisfied. In the first place, against those who have thought otherwise, it is determined, by infinite odds of authority, that there <i>is such a case</i>, both of nouns and of pronouns. Many a common reader will wonder, who can have been ignorant enough to deny it. "The learned and sagacious Wallis, to whom every English grammarian owes a tribute of reverence, calls this modification of the noun an <i>adjective</i> possessive<i>; I think, with no more propriety than he might have applied the</i> same to the Latin genitive."--<i>Dr. Johnson's Gram.</i>, p. 5. Brightland also, who gave to <i>adjectives</i> the name of <i>qualities</i>, included all possessives among them, calling them "<i>Possessive Qualities</i>, or <i>Qualities of</i> Possession<i>."--</i>Brightland's Gram.<i>, p. 90.</i></p>
<p>OBS. 11.--This exploded error, William S. Cardell, a few years ago, republished as a novelty; for which, among other pretended improvements of a like sort, he received the ephemeral praise of some of our modern literati. William B. Fowle also teaches the same thing. See his <i>Common</i> School Gram.<i>, Part II, p. 104. In Felch's Grammar, too, published in</i> Boston in 1837, an attempt is made, to revive this old doctrine; but the author takes no notice of any of the above-named authorities, being probably ignorant of them all. His <i>reasoning</i> upon the point, does not appear to me to be worthy of a detailed answer.[165] That the possessive case of nouns is not an adjective, is demonstrable; because it may have adjectives of various kinds, relating to it: as, "<i>This old man's</i> daughter."--<i>Shak.</i> It may also govern an other possessive; as, "<i>Peter's</i> wife's <i>mother."--</i>Bible<i>. Here the former possessive is governed by the</i> latter; but, if both were adjectives, they would both relate to the noun <i>mother</i>, and so produce a confusion of ideas. Again, nouns of the possessive case have a distinction of number, which adjectives have not. In gender also, there lies a difference. Adjectives, whenever they are varied by gender or number, <i>agree with their nouns</i> in these respects. Not so with possessives; as, "In the <i>Jews'</i> religion."--<i>Gal.</i>, i. 13. "The <i>children's</i> bread."--<i>Mark</i>, vii, 27. "Some <i>men's</i> sins."--<i>1 Tim.</i>, v, 24. "Other <i>men's</i> sins."--<i>Ib.</i>, ver. 22.</p>
<p>OBS. 12.--Secondly, general custom has clearly determined that the possessive case of <i>nouns</i> is always to be written <i>with an apostrophe</i>: except in those few instances in which it is not governed singly by the noun following, but so connected with an other that both are governed jointly; as, "<i>Cato the Censor's</i> doctrine,"--"<i>Sir Walter Scott's</i> Works,"--"<i>Beaumont</i> and <i>Fletcher's Plays.</i>" This custom of using the apostrophe, however, has been opposed by many. Brightland, and Buchanan, and the author of the British Grammar, and some late writers in the Philological Museum, are among those who have successively taught, that the possessive case should be formed <i>like the nominative plural</i>, by adding <i>s</i> when the pronunciation admits the sound, and <i>es</i> when the word acquires an additional syllable. Some of these approve of the apostrophe, and others do not. Thus Brightland gives some examples, which are contrary to his rule, adopting that strange custom of putting the <i>s</i> in Roman, and the name in Italic; "as, King <i>Charles<b>s</b></i> <b>Court<i>, and St.</i> James</b>s <i>Park.</i>"--<i>Gram. of the English Tongue</i>, p. 91.</p>
<p>OBS. 13.--"The genitive case, in my opinion," says Dr. Ash, "might be much more properly formed by adding <i>s</i>, or when the pronunciation requires it, <i>es</i>, without an Apostrophe: as, <i>men, mens; Ox, Oxes; Horse, Horses; Ass,</i> Asses.<i>"--</i>Ash's Gram.<i>, p. 23. "To write</i> Ox's, Ass's, Fox's<i>, and at the</i> same time pronounce it <i>Oxes, Asses, Foxes</i>, is such a departure from the original formation, at least in writing, and such an inconsistent use of the Apostrophe, as cannot be equalled perhaps in any other language."--<i>Ib.</i> Lowth, too, gives some countenance to this objection: "It [i.e., <b>God's grace</b>] was formerly written <b>Godis grace;</b> we now always shorten it with an apostrophe; often <i>very improperly</i>, when we are obliged to pronounce it fully; as, <b>Thomas's <i>book,' that is,</i></b> <i>Thomasis</i> book,' not '<i>Thomas his</i> book,' as it is commonly supposed."--<i>Lowth's Gram.</i>, p. 17. Whatever weight there may be in this argument, the objection has been overruled by general custom. The convenience of distinguishing, even to the eye alone, the numbers and cases of the noun, is found too great to be relinquished. If the declension of English nouns is ever to be amended, it cannot be done in this way. It is understood by every reader, that the <i>apostrophic s</i> adds a syllable to the noun, whenever it will not unite with the sound in which the nominative ends; as, <i>torch's</i>, pronounced <i>torchiz</i>.</p>
<pre>  "Yet time ennobles or degrades each line;
   It brightened <i>Craggs's</i>, and may darken thine."--<i>Pope.</i>
</pre>
<p>OBS. 14.--The English possessive case unquestionably originated in that form of the Saxon genitive which terminates in <i>es</i>, examples of which may be found in almost any specimen of the Saxon tongue: as, "On <i>Herodes</i> dagum,"--"In <i>Herod's</i> days;"--"Of <i>Aarones</i> dohtrum,"--"Of <i>Aaron's</i> daughters."--<i>Luke</i>, i, 5. This ending was sometimes the same as that of the plural; and both were changed to <i>is</i> or <i>ys</i>, before they became what we now find them. This termination added a syllable to the word; and Lowth suggests, in the quotation above, that the apostrophe was introduced to shorten it. But some contend, that the use of this mark originated in a mistake. It appears from the testimony of Brightland, Johnson, Lowth, Priestley, and others, who have noticed the error in order to correct it, that an opinion was long entertained, that the termination '<i>s</i> was a contraction of the word <i>his</i>. It is certain that Addison thought so; for he expressly says it, in the 135th number of the Spectator. Accordingly he wrote, in lieu of the regular possessive, "My paper is <i>Ulysses his</i> bow."--<i>Guardian</i>, No. 98. "Of <i>Socrates his</i> rules of prayer."--<i>Spect.</i>, No. 207. So Lowth quotes Pope: "By <i>young Telemachus his</i> blooming years."--<i>Lowth's Gram.</i>, p. 17.[166] There is also one late author who says, "The '<i>s</i> is a contraction of <i>his</i>, and was formerly written in full; as, William Russell <i>his</i> book."--<i>Goodenow's Gram.</i>, p. 32. This is undoubtedly bad English; and always was so, however common may have been the erroneous notion which gave rise to it. But the apostrophe, whatever may have been its origin, is now the acknowledged distinctive mark of the possessive case of English nouns. The application of the '<i>s</i>, frequently to feminines, and sometimes to plurals, is proof positive that it is <i>not a</i> contraction <i>of the pronoun</i> his<i>; as,</i></p>
<pre>  "Now Jove suspends his golden scales in air,
   Weighs the <i>men's</i> wits against the <i>Lady's</i> hair."
       --<i>Pope</i>, R. of L., C. v, l. 72.
</pre>
<p>OBS. 15.--Many of the old grammarians, and Guy, Pinneo, and Spencer, among the moderns, represent the regular formation of the possessive case as being the same in both numbers, supposing generally in the plural an abbreviation of the word by the omission of the second or syllabic <i>s</i>. That is, they suppose that such terms as <i>eagles' wings, angels' visits</i>, were written for <i>eagles's wings, angels's visits</i>, &amp;c. This odd view of the matter accounts well enough for the fashion of such plurals as <i>men's,</i> women's, children's<i>, and makes them regular. But I find no evidence at all</i> of the fact on which these authors presume; nor do I believe that the regular possessive plural was ever, in general, a syllable longer than the nominative. If it ever had been so, it would still be easy to prove the point, by citations from ancient books. The general principle then is, that <i>the apostrophe forms the possessive case, with an s in the singular, and</i> without it in the plural<i>; but there are some exceptions to this rule, on</i> either hand; and these must be duly noticed.</p>
<p>OBS. 16.--The chief exceptions, or irregularities, in the formation of the possessive <i>singular</i>, are, I think, to be accounted mere poetic licenses; and seldom, if ever, to be allowed in prose. Churchill, (closely copying Lowth,) speaks of them thus: "In poetry the <i>s</i> is frequently omitted after proper names ending in <i>s</i> or <i>x</i> as, 'The wrath of <i>Peleus'</i> son.' <i>Pope.</i> This is scarcely allowable in prose, though instances of it occur: as, <b>Moses</b> minister.' <i>Josh.</i>, i, 1. <b>Phinehas</b> wife.' <i>1 Sam.</i>, iv, 19. 'Festus came into <i>Felix'</i> room.' <i>Acts</i>, xxiv, 27. It was done in prose evidently to avoid the recurrence of a sibilant sound at the end of two following syllables; but this may as readily be obviated by using the preposition <i>of</i>, which is now commonly substituted for the possessive case in most instances."--<i>Churchill's New Gram.</i>, p. 215. In Scott's Bible, Philadelphia, 1814, the texts here quoted are all of them corrected, thus: "<i>Moses's</i> minister,"--"<i>Phinehas's</i> wife,"--"<i>Felix's</i> room." But the phrase, "for <i>conscience</i> sake," (<i>Rom.</i>, xiii, 5,) is there given without the apostrophe. Alger prints it, "for <i>conscience'</i> sake," which is better; and though not regular, it is a common form for this particular expression. Our common Bibles have this text: "And the weaned child shall put his hand on the <i>cockatrice'</i> den."--<i>Isaiah</i>, xi, 8. Alger, seeing this to be wrong, wrote it, "on the <i>cockatrice-den</i>."--<i>Pronouncing Bible.</i> Dr. Scott, in his Reference Bible, makes this possessive regular, "on the <i>cockatrice's</i> den." This is right. The Vulgate has it, "<i>in caverna</i> reguli<i>;" which, however, is not classic Latin. After</i> z <i>also, the poets</i> sometimes drop the <i>s</i>: as,</p>
<pre>  "Sad was the hour, and luckless was the day,
   When first from <i>Shiraz'</i> walls I bent my way."--<i>Collins.</i>
</pre>
<p>OBS. 17.--A recent critic, who, I think, has not yet learned to speak or write the possessive case of <i>his own name</i> properly, assumes that the foregoing occasional or poetical forms are the only true ones for the possessive singular of such words. He says, "When the name <i>does end</i> with the sound of <i>s</i> or <i>z</i>, (no matter what letter represents the sound,) the possessive form <i>is made</i> by annexing only an apostrophe."--<i>O. B. Peirce's</i> Gram.<i>, p. 44. Agreeably to this rule, he letters his work, "</i>Peirce' Grammar<i>," and condemns, as bad English, the following examples and all</i> others like them: "James <i>Otis's</i> letters, General <i>Gates's</i> command, General <i>Knox's</i> appointment, Gov. <i>Meigs's</i> promptness, Mr. <i>Williams's</i> oration, The <i>witness's</i> deposition."--<i>Ib.</i>, p. 60. It is obvious that this gentleman's doctrine and criticism are as contrary to the common practice of all good authors, as they are to the common grammars, which he ridicules. Surely, such expressions as, "<i>Harris's</i> Hermes, <i>Philips's</i> Poems, <i>Prince's</i> Bay, <i>Prince's</i> Island, <i>Fox's</i> Journal, King <i>James's</i> edict, a <i>justice's</i> warrant, <i>Sphinx's</i> riddle, the <i>lynx's</i> beam, the <i>lass's</i> beauty," have authority enough to refute the cavil of this writer; who, being himself wrong, falsely charges the older grammarians, that," their theories vary from the principles of the language correctly spoken or written."--<i>Ib.</i>, p. 60. A much more judicious author treats this point of grammar as follows: "When the possessive noun is singular, and terminates with an <i>s</i>, another <i>s</i> is requisite after it, and the apostrophe must be placed between the two; as, <b>Dickens's <i>works,'--</i></b><i>Harris's</i> wit.'"--<i>Day's Punctuation, Third London Edition</i>, p. 136. The following example, too, is right: "I would not yield to be your <i>house's</i> guest."--<i>Shakespeare</i>.</p>
<p>OBS. 18.--All <i>plural</i> nouns that differ from the singular without ending in <i>s</i>, form the possessive case in the same manner as the singular: as, <i>man's, men's; woman's, women's j child's, children's; brother's, brothers'</i> or brethren's; ox's, oxen's; goose, geese's<i>. In two or three words which</i> are otherwise alike in both numbers, the apostrophe ought to follow the <i>s</i> in the plural, to distinguish it from the singular: as, the <i>sheep's</i> fleece, the <i>sheeps <b>fleeces; a</b></i> <b>neat's <i>tongue,</i> neats</b> tongues; a <i>deer's</i> horns, a load of <i>deers'</i> horns.</p>
<p>OBS. 19.--Dr. Ash says, "Nouns of the plural number that end in <i>s</i>, will not very properly admit of the genitive case."--<i>Ash's Gram.</i>, p. 54. And Dr. Priestley appears to have been of the same opinion. See his <i>Gram.</i>, p. 69. Lowth too avers, that the sign of the possessive case is "never added to the plural number ending in <i>s</i>."--<i>Gram.</i>, p. 18. Perhaps he thought the plural sign must involve an other <i>s</i>, like the singular. This however is not true, neither is Dr. Ash's assertion true; for the New Testament speaks as properly of "the <i>soldiers'</i> counsel," as of the "<i>centurion's</i> servant;" of "the scribes that were of the <i>Pharisees'</i> part," as of "<i>Paul's sister's</i> son." It would appear, however, that the possessive plural is less frequently used than the possessive singular; its place being much oftener supplied by the preposition <i>of</i> and the objective. We cannot say that either of them is absolutely necessary to the language; but they are both worthy to be commended, as furnishing an agreeable variety of expression.</p>
<pre>  "Then shall <i>man's</i> pride and dulness comprehend
   His <i>actions', passions', being's</i> use and end."--<i>Pope</i>.
</pre>
<p>OBS. 20.--The apostrophe was introduced into the possessive case, at least for the singular number, in some part of the seventeenth century. Its adoption for the plural, appears to have been later: it is not much used in books a hundred years old. In Buchanan's "Regular English Syntax," which was written, I know not exactly when, but near the middle of the eighteenth century, I find the following paragraph: "We have certainly a Genitive Plural, though there has been no Mark to distinguish it. The Warriors Arms, i. e. the Arms of the Warriors, is as much a Genitive Plural, as the Warrior's Arms, for the Arms of the Warrior is a Genitive Singular. To distinguish this Genitive Plural, especially to Foreigners, we might use the Apostrophe reversed, thus, the Warrior`s Arms, the Stone`s End, for the End of the Stones, the Grocer`s, Taylor`s, Haberdasher`s, &amp;c. Company; for the Company of Grocers, Taylors, &amp;c. The Surgeon`s Hall, for the Hall of the Surgeons; the Rider`s Names, for the Names of the Riders; and so of all Plural Possessives."--See <i>Buchan. Synt.</i>, p. 111. Our present form of the possessive plural, being unknown to this grammarian, must have had a later origin; nor can it have been, as some imagine it was, an abbreviation of a longer and more ancient form.</p>
<p>OBS. 21.--The apostrophic <i>s</i> has often been added to nouns <i>improperly</i>; the words formed by it not being intended for the possessive singular, but for the nominative or objective plural. Thus we find such authors as Addison and Swift, writing <i>Jacobus's</i> and <i>genius's</i>, for <i>Jacobuses</i> and <i>geniuses</i>; <i>idea's, toga's</i>, and <i>tunica's</i>, for <i>ideas, togas</i>, and <i>tunicas</i>; <i>enamorato's</i> and <i>virtuoso's</i>, for <i>enamoratoes</i> and <i>virtuosoes</i>. Errors of this kind, should be carefully avoided.</p>
<p>OBS. 22.--The apostrophe and <i>s</i> are sometimes added to mere characters, to denote plurality, and not the possessive case; as, two <i>a<b>s, three</b></i> <b>b</b>s, four 9's. These we cannot avoid, except by using the <i>names</i> of the things: as, two <i>Aes</i>, three <i>Bees</i>, four <i>Nines</i>. "Laced down the sides with little <i>c<b>s."--</b></i><b>Steele<i>. "Whenever two</i> gg</b>s come together, they are both hard."--<i>Buchanan</i>. The names of <i>c</i> and <i>g</i>, plural, are <i>Cees</i> and <i>Gees</i>. Did these authors <i>know</i> the words, or did they not? To have learned the <i>names</i> of the letters, will be found on many occasions a great convenience, especially to critics. For example: "The pronunciation of these two consecutive <i>s's</i> is hard."--<i>Webber's Gram.</i>, p. 21. Better: "<i>Esses</i>." "<i>S</i> and <i>x</i>, however, are exceptions. They are pluralyzed by adding <i>es</i> preceded by a hyphen [-], as the <i>s-es</i>; the <i>x-es</i>."--<i>O. B.</i> Peirce's Gram.<i>, p. 40. Better, use the</i> names, Ess <i>and</i> Ex<i>, and</i> pluralize thus: "the <i>Esses</i>; the <i>Exes</i>."</p>
<pre>  "Make Q's of answers, to waylay
   What th' other party's like to say."
       --<i>Hudibras</i>, P. III, C. ii, l. 951.
</pre>
<p>Here the cipher is to be read <i>Kues</i>, but it has not the meaning of this name merely. It is put either for the plural of <i>Q.</i>, a <i>Question</i>, like D. D.'s, (read <i>Dee-Dees</i>,) for <i>Doctors of Divinity</i>; or else, more erroneously, for <i>cues</i>, the plural of <i>cue</i>, a turn which the next speaker catches.</p>
<p>OBS. 23.--In the following example, the apostrophe and <i>s</i> are used to give the sound of a <i>verb's</i> termination, to words which the writer supposed were not properly verbs: "When a man in a soliloquy reasons with himself, and <i>pro's</i> and <i>con's</i>, and weighs all his designs."--<i>Congreve</i>. But here, "<i>proes</i> and <i>cons</i>," would have been more accurate. "We put the ordered number of <i>m's</i> into our composing-stick."--<i>Printer's Gram.</i> Here "<i>Ems</i>" would have done as well. "All measures for <i>folio's</i> and <i>quarto's</i>, should be made to <i>m's</i> of the English body; all measures for <i>octavo's</i>, to Pica <i>m's</i>."--<i>Ibid.</i> Here regularity requires, "<i>folios,</i> quartoes, octavoes<i>," and "</i>pica Ems<i>." The verb</i> is<i>, when contracted,</i> sometimes gives to its nominative the same form as that of the possessive case, it not being always spaced off for distinction, as it may be; as,</p>
<pre>  "A <i>wit's</i> a feather, and a chief a rod;
   An honest <i>man's</i> the noblest work of God."
       --<i>Pope, on Man</i>, Ep. iv, l. 247.
</pre>
<p>OBS. 24.--As the <i>objective case of nouns</i> is to be distinguished from the nominative, only by the sense, relation, and position, of words in a sentence, the learner must acquire a habit of attending to these several things. Nor ought it to be a hardship to any reader to understand that which he thinks worth reading. It is seldom possible to mistake one of these cases for the other, without a total misconception of the author's meaning. The nominative denotes the agent, actor, or doer; the person or thing that is made the subject of an affirmation, negation, question, or supposition: its place, except in a question, is commonly <i>before</i> the verb. The objective, when governed by a verb or a participle, denotes the person on whom, or the thing on which, the action falls and terminates: it is commonly placed <i>after</i> the verb, participle, or preposition, which governs it. Nouns, then, by changing places, may change cases: as, "<i>Jonathan</i> loved <i>David</i>;" "<i>David</i> loved <i>Jonathan</i>." Yet the case depends not entirely upon position; for any order in which the words cannot be misunderstood, is allowable: as, "Such tricks hath strong imagination."--<i>Shak.</i> Here the cases are known, because the meaning is plainly this: "Strong imagination hath such tricks." "To him give all the prophets witness."--<i>Acts</i>, x, 43. This is intelligible enough, and more forcible than the same meaning expressed thus: "All the prophets give witness to him." The <i>order</i> of the words never can affect the explanation to be given of them in parsing, unless it change the sense, and form them into a different sentence.</p>

<p>The definitions to be given in the Third Praxis, are two for an article, six for a noun, and one for an adjective, a pronoun, a verb, a participle, an adverb, a conjunction, a preposition, or an interjection. Thus<i>:--</i></p>
<p>EXAMPLE PARSED.</p>
<p>"The writings of Hannah More appear to me more praiseworthy than Scott's."</p>
<p><i>The</i> is the definite article. 1. An article is the word <i>the, an</i>, or <i>a</i>, which we put before nouns to limit their signification. 2. The definite article is <i>the</i>, which denotes some particular thing or things.</p>
<p><i>Writings</i> is a common noun, of the third person, plural number, neuter gender, and nominative case. 1. A noun is the name of any person, place, or thing, that can be known or mentioned. 2.

A noun is the name of any person, place, or thing, that can be known or mentioned. 2. A proper noun is the name of some particular individual, or people, or group. 3. The third person is that which denotes the person or thing merely spoken of. 4. The singular number is that which denotes but one. 5. The feminine gender is that which denotes persons or animals of the female kind. 6. The objective case is that form or state of a noun or pronoun, which usually denotes the object of a verb, participle, or preposition.</p>
<p><i>Appear</i> is a verb. 1. A verb is a word that signifies <i>to be, to act</i>, or <i>to be acted upon</i>.</p>
<p><i>To</i> is a preposition. 1. A preposition is a word used to express some relation of different things or thoughts to each other, and is generally placed before a noun or a pronoun.</p>
<p><i>Me</i> is a pronoun. 1. A pronoun is a word used in stead of a noun.</p>

<p>"For whose name sake, I have been made willing."--<i>Wm. Penn</i>.</p>
<p>[FORMULE.--Not proper, because the noun <i>name</i>, which is here meant for the possessive case singular, has not the true form of that case. But, according to a principle on page 258th, "The possessive case of nouns is formed, in the singular number, by adding to the nominative <i>s preceded by</i> an apostrophe<i>; and, in the plural, when the nominative ends in</i> s<i>, by</i> adding <i>an apostrophe only</i>."

CHAPTER IV.--ADJECTIVES.</p>
<p>An Adjective is a word added to a noun or pronoun, and generally expresses quality: as, A <i>wise</i> man; a <i>new</i> book. You <i>two</i> are <i>diligent</i>.</p>
<p><br>
OBSERVATIONS.</p>
<p>OBS. 1.--Adjectives have been otherwise called attributes, attributives, qualities, adnouns; but none of these names is any better than the common one. Some writers have classed adjectives with verbs; because, with a neuter verb for the copula, they often form logical predicates: as, "Vices <i>are contagious</i>." The Latin grammarians usually class them with nouns; consequently their nouns are divided into nouns substantive and nouns adjective. With us, substantives are nouns; and adjectives form a part of speech by themselves. This is generally acknowledged to be a much better distribution. Adjectives cannot with propriety be called <i>nouns</i>, in any language; because they are not <i>the names</i> of the qualities which they signify. They must be <i>added</i> to nouns or pronouns in order to make sense. But if, in a just distribution of words, the term "<i>adjective nouns</i>" is needless and improper, the term "<i>adjective pronouns</i>" is, certainly, not less so: most of the words which Murray and others call by this name, are not pronouns, but adjectives.</p>
<p>OBS. 2.--The noun, or substantive, is a <i>name</i>, which makes sense of itself. The adjective is an adjunct to the noun or pronoun. It is a word added to denote quality, situation, quantity, number, form, tendency, or whatever else may characterize and distinguish the thing or things spoken of. Adjectives, therefore, are distinguished <i>from</i> nouns by their <i>relation to</i> them; a relation corresponding to that which qualities bear to things: so that no part of speech is more easily discriminated than the adjective. Again: English adjectives, as such, are all indeclinable. When, therefore, any words usually belonging to this class, are found to take either the plural or the possessive form, like substantive nouns, they are to be parsed as nouns. To abbreviate expression, we not unfrequently, in this manner, convert adjectives into nouns. Thus, in grammar, we often speak of <i>nominatives, possessives</i>, or <i>objectives</i>, meaning nouns or pronouns of the nominative, the possessive, or the objective case; of <i>positives, comparatives</i>, or <i>superlatives</i>, meaning adjectives of the positive, the comparative, or the superlative degree; of <i>infinitives,</i> subjunctives<i>, or</i> imperatives<i>, meaning verbs of the infinitive, the</i> subjunctive, or the imperative mood; and of <i>singulars, plurals</i>, and many other such things, in the same way. So a man's <i>superiors</i> or <i>inferiors</i> are persons superior or inferior to himself. His <i>betters</i> are persons better than he. <i>Others</i> are any persons or things distinguished from some that are named or referred to; as, "If you want enemies, excel <i>others</i>; if you want friends, let <i>others</i> excel you."--<i>Lacon</i>. All adjectives thus taken substantively, become <i>nouns</i>, and ought to be parsed as such, unless this word <i>others</i> is to be made an exception, and called a "<i>pronoun</i>."</p>
<pre>  "Th' event is fear'd; should we again provoke
   Our <i>stronger</i>, some worse way his wrath may find."
       --<i>Milton, P. L.</i>, B. ii, l. 82.
</pre>
<p>OBS. 3.--Murray says, "Perhaps the words <i>former</i> and <i>latter</i> may be properly ranked amongst the demonstrative pronouns, <i>especially in many of</i> their applications<i>. The following sentence may serve as an example: 'It</i> was happy for the state, that Fabius continued in the command with Minutius: the <i>former's</i> phlegm was a check upon the <i>latter's</i> vivacity.'"--<i>Gram.</i>, 8vo, p. 57. This I take to be bad English. <i>Former</i> and <i>latter</i> ought to be adjectives only; except when <i>former</i> means <i>maker</i>. And, if not so, it is too easy a way of multiplying pronouns, to manufacture two out of one single anonymous sentence. If it were said, "The deliberation of <i>the former</i> was a seasonable chock upon the fiery temper of <i>the latter</i>" the words <i>former</i> and <i>latter</i> would seem to me not to be pronouns, but adjectives, each relating to the noun <i>commander</i> understood after it.</p>
<p>OBS. 4.--The sense and relation of words in sentences, as well as their particular form and meaning, must be considered in parsing, before the learner can say, with certainty, to what class they belong. Other parts of speech, and especially nouns and participles, by a change in their construction, may become adjectives. Thus, to denote the material of which a thing is formed, we very commonly make the name of the substantive an adjective to that of the thing: as, A <i>gold chain</i>, a <i>silver spoon</i>, a <i>glass pitcher</i>, a <i>tin basin</i>, an <i>oak plank</i>, a <i>basswood slab</i>, a <i>whalebone rod</i>. This construction is in general correct, whenever the former word may be predicated of the latter; as, "The chain is gold."--"The spoon is silver." But we do not write <i>gold beater</i> for <i>goldbeater</i>, or <i>silver smith</i> for <i>silversmith</i>; because the beater is not gold, nor is the smith silver. This principle, however, is not universally observed; for we write <i>snowball, whitewash</i>, and many similar compounds, though the ball is snow and the wash is white; and <i>linseed oil</i>, or <i>Newark cider</i>, may be a good phrase, though the former word cannot well be predicated of the latter. So in the following examples: "Let these <i>conversation</i> tones be the foundation of public pronunciation."--<i>Blair's Rhet.</i>, p. 334. "A <i>muslin</i> flounce, made very full, would give a very agreeable <i>flirtation</i> air."--POPE: <i>Priestley's Gram.</i>, p. 79.</p>
<pre>  "Come, calm Content, serene and sweet,
   O gently guide my <i>pilgrim</i> feet
   To find thy <i>hermit</i> cell."--<i>Barbauld</i>.
</pre>
<p>OBS. 5.--Murray says, "Various nouns placed before other nouns assume the nature of adjectives: as, sea fish, wine vessel, corn field, meadow ground, &amp;c."--<i>Octavo Gram.</i>, p. 48. This is, certainly, very lame instruction. If there is not palpable error in all his examples, the propriety of them all is at least questionable; and, to adopt and follow out their principle, would be, to tear apart some thousands of our most familiar compounds. "<i>Meadow ground</i>" may perhaps be a correct phrase, since the ground is meadow; it seems therefore preferable to the compound word meadow-ground. What he meant by "<i>wine vessel</i>" is doubtful: that is, whether a ship or a cask, a flagon or a decanter. If we turn to our dictionaries, Webster has <i>sea-fish</i> and <i>wine-cask</i> with a hyphen, and <i>cornfield</i> without; while Johnson and others have <i>corn-field</i> with a hyphen, and <i>seafish</i> without. According to the rules for the figure of words, we ought to write them <i>seafish, winecask, cornfield</i>. What then becomes of the thousands of "adjectives" embraced in the "&amp;c." quoted above?</p>
<p>OBS. 6.--The pronouns <i>he</i> and <i>she</i>, when placed before or prefixed to nouns merely to denote their gender, appear to be used adjectively; as, "The male or <i>he</i> animals offered in sacrifice."--<i>Wood's Dict., w. Males</i>. "The most usual term is <i>he</i> or <i>she, male</i> or <i>female</i>, employed as an adjective: as, a <i>he bear</i>, a <i>she bear</i>; a <i>male elephant</i>, a <i>female</i> elephant<i>."--</i>Churchill's Gram.<i>, p. 69. Most writers, however, think</i> proper to insert a hyphen in the terms here referred to: as, <i>he-bear,</i> she-bear<i>, the plurals of which are</i> he-bears <i>and</i> she-bears<i>. And,</i> judging by the foregoing rule of predication, we must assume that this practice only is right. In the first example, the word <i>he</i> is useless; for the term "<i>male animals</i>" is sufficiently clear without it. It has been shown in the third chapter, that <i>he</i> and <i>she</i> are sometimes used as nouns; and that, as such, they may take the regular declension of nouns, making the plurals <i>hes</i> and <i>shes</i>. But whenever these words are used adjectively to denote gender, whether we choose to insert the hyphen or not, they are, without question, indeclinable, like other adjectives. In the following example, Sanborn will have <i>he</i> to be a noun in the <i>objective</i> case; but I consider it rather, to be an adjective, signifying <i>masculine</i>:</p>
<pre>  "(<i>Philosophy</i>, I say, and call <i>it He</i>;
   For, whatsoe'er the painter's fancy be,
   It a male-virtue seems to me.")--<i>Cowley</i>, Brit. Poets, Vol. ii, p. 54.
</pre>
<p>OBS. 7.--Though verbs give rise to many adjectives, they seldom, if ever, become such by a mere change of construction. It is mostly by assuming an additional termination, that any verb is formed into an adjective: as in <i>teachable, moveable, oppressive, diffusive, prohibitory</i>. There are, however, about forty words ending in <i>ate</i>, which, without difference of form, are either verbs or adjectives; as, <i>aggregate, animate, appropriate,</i> articulate, aspirate, associate, complicate, confederate, consummate, deliberate, desolate, effeminate, elate, incarnate, intimate, legitimate, moderate, ordinate, precipitate, prostrate, regenerate, reprobate, separate, sophisticate, subordinate<i>. This class of adjectives seems to be</i> lessening. The participials in <i>ed</i>, are superseding some of them, at least in popular practice: as, <i>contaminated</i>, for <i>contaminate</i>, defiled; <i>reiterated</i>, for <i>reiterate</i>, repeated; <i>situated</i>, for <i>situate</i>, placed; <i>attenuated</i>, for <i>attenuate</i>, made thin or slender. <i>Devote, exhaust</i>, and some other verbal forms, are occasionally used by the poets, in lieu of the participial forms, <i>devoted, exhausted</i>, &amp;c.</p>
<p>OBS. 8.--Participles, which have naturally much resemblance to this part of speech, often drop their distinctive character, and become adjectives. This is usually the case whenever they stand immediately <i>before</i> the nouns to which they relate; as, A <i>pleasing</i> countenance, a <i>piercing</i> eye, an <i>accomplished</i> scholar, an <i>exalted</i> station. Many participial adjectives are derivatives formed from participles by the negative prefix <i>un</i>, which reverses the meaning of the primitive word; as, <i>undisturbed, undivided,</i> unenlightened<i>. Most words of this kind differ of course from participles,</i> because there are no such verbs as <i>to undisturb, to undivide</i>, &amp;c. Yet they may be called participial adjectives, because they have the termination, and embrace the form, of participles. Nor should any participial adjective be needlessly varied from the true orthography of the participle: a distinction is, however, observed by some writers, between <i>past</i> and <i>passed, staid</i> and <i>stayed</i>; and some old words, as <i>drunken,</i> stricken, shotten, rotten<i>, now obsolete as participles, are still retained</i> as adjectives. This sort of words will be further noticed in the chapter on participles.</p>
<p>OBS. 9.--Adverbs are generally distinguished from adjectives, by the form, as well as by the construction, of the words. Yet, in instances not a few, the same word is capable of being used both adjectively and adverbially. In these cases, the scholar must determine the part of speech, by the construction alone; remembering that adjectives belong to nouns or pronouns only; and adverbs, to verbs, participles, adjectives, or other adverbs, only. The following examples from Scripture, will partially illustrate this point, which will be noticed again under the head of syntax: "Is your father well?"--<i>Gen.</i>, xliii, 27. "Thou hast well said."--<i>John</i>, iv, 17. "He separateth very friends."--<i>Prov.</i>, xvii, 9. "Esaias is <i>very</i> bold."--<i>Rom.</i>, x, 20. "For a pretence, ye make <i>long</i> prayer."--<i>Matt.</i>, xxiii, 14. "They that tarry <i>long</i> at the wine."--<i>Prov.</i>, xxiii, 30. "It had not <i>much</i> earth."--<i>Mark</i>, iv, 5. "For she loved <i>much</i>."--<i>Luke</i>, vii, 47.</p>
<p>OBS. 10.--Prepositions, in regard to their <i>construction</i>, differ from adjectives, almost exactly as active-transitive participles differ syntactically from adjectives: that is, in stead of being mere adjuncts to the words which follow them, they govern those words, and refer back to some other term; which, in the usual order of speech, stands before them. Thus, if I say, "A spreading oak," <i>spreading</i> is an adjective relating to oak; if, "A boy spreading hay," <i>spreading</i> is a participle, governing <i>hay</i>, and relating to <i>boy</i>, because the boy is the agent of the action. So, when Dr. Webster says, "The <i>off</i> horse in a team," <i>off</i> is an adjective, relating to the noun <i>horse</i>; but, in the phrase, "A man <i>off</i> his guard," <i>off</i> is a preposition, showing the relation between <i>man</i> and <i>guard</i>, and governing the latter. The following are other examples: "From the <i>above</i> speculations."--<i>Harris's Hermes</i>, p. 194. "An <i>after</i> period of life."--MARSHALL: <i>in Web. Dict.</i> "With some other of the <i>after</i> Judaical rites."--<i>Right of Tythes</i>, p. 86. "Whom this <i>beneath</i> world doth embrace and hug."--<i>Shak.</i> "Especially is <i>over</i> exertion made."--<i>Journal</i> of Lit. Conv.<i>, p. 119. "To both the</i> under <i>worlds."--</i>Hudibras<i>. "Please</i> to pay to A. B. the amount of the <i>within</i> bill." Whether properly used or not, the words <i>above, after, beneath, over, under, and within</i>, are here unquestionably made <i>adjectives</i>; yet every scholar knows, that they are generally prepositions, though sometimes adverbs.</p>
<p><br>
CLASSES.</p>
<p>Adjectives may be divided into six classes; namely, <i>common, proper,</i> numeral, pronominal, participial<i>, and</i> compound<i>.</i></p>
<p>I. A <i>common adjective</i> is any ordinary epithet, or adjective denoting quality or situation; as, <i>Good, bad, peaceful, warlike--eastern, western,</i> outer, inner<i>.</i></p>
<p>II. A <i>proper adjective</i> is an adjective formed from a proper name; as, <i>American, English, Platonic, Genoese</i>.</p>
<p>III. A <i>numeral adjective</i> is an adjective that expresses a definite number; as, <i>One, two, three, four, five, six</i>, &amp;c.</p>
<p>IV. A <i>pronominal adjective</i> is a definitive word which may either accompany its noun, or represent it understood; as, "<i>All</i> join to guard what <i>each</i> desires to gain."--<i>Pope</i>. That is, "<i>All men</i> join to guard what <i>each man</i> desires to gain."</p>
<p>V. A <i>participial adjective</i> is one that has the form of a participle, but differs from it by rejecting the idea of time; as, "An <i>amusing</i> story,"--"A <i>lying</i> divination."</p>
<p>VI. A <i>compound adjective</i> is one that consists of two or more words joined together, either by the hyphen or solidly: as, <i>Nut-brown, laughter-loving,</i> four-footed; threefold, lordlike, lovesick<i>.</i></p>
<p><br>
OBSERVATIONS.</p>
<p>OBS. 1.--This distribution of the adjectives is no less easy to be applied, than necessary to a proper explanation in parsing. How many adjectives there are in the language, it is difficult to say; none of our dictionaries profess to exhibit all that are embraced in some of the foregoing classes. Of the Common Adjectives, there are probably not fewer than six thousand, exclusive of the common nouns which we refer to this class when they are used adjectively. Walker's Rhyming Dictionary contains five thousand or more, the greater part of which may be readily distinguished by their peculiar endings. Of those which end in <i>ous</i>, as <i>generous</i>, there are about 850. Of those in <i>y</i> or <i>ly</i>, as <i>shaggy,</i> homely<i>, there are about 550. Of those in</i> ive<i>, as</i> deceptive<i>, there are</i> about 400. Of those in <i>al</i>, as <i>autumnal</i>, there are about 550. Of those in <i>ical</i>, as <i>mechanical</i>, there are about 350. Of those in <i>able</i>, as <i>valuable</i>, there are about 600. Of those in <i>ible</i>, as <i>credible</i>, there are about 200. Of those in <i>ent</i>, as <i>different</i>, there are about 300. Of those in <i>ant</i>, as <i>abundant</i>, there are about 170. Of those in <i>less</i>, as <i>ceaseless</i>, there are about 220. Of those in <i>ful</i>, as <i>useful</i>, there are about 130. Of those in <i>ory</i>, as <i>explanatory</i>, there are about 200. Of those in <i>ish</i>, as <i>childish</i>, there are about 100. Of those in <i>ine</i>, as <i>masculine</i>, there are about 70. Of those in <i>en</i>, as <i>wooden</i>, there are about 50. Of those in <i>some</i>, as <i>quarrelsome</i>, there are about 30. These sixteen numbers added together, make 4770.</p>
<p>OBS. 2.--The Proper Adjectives are, in many instances, capable of being converted into declinable nouns: as, <i>European, a European, the Europeans;</i> Greek, a Greek, the Greeks; Asiatic, an Asiatic, the Asiatics<i>. But with</i> the words <i>English, French, Dutch, Scotch, Welsh, Irish</i>, and in general all such as would acquire an additional syllable in their declension, the case is otherwise. The gentile noun has frequently fewer syllables than the adjective, but seldom more, unless derived from some different root. Examples: <i>Arabic, an Arab, the Arabs; Gallic, a Gaul, the Gauls; Danish, a</i> Dane, the Danes; Moorish, a Moor, the Moors; Polish, a Pole<i>, or</i> Polander, the Poles; Swedish, a Swede, the Swedes; Turkish, a Turk, the Turks<i>. When</i> we say, <i>the English, the French, the Dutch, the Scotch, the Welsh, the</i> Irish<i>,--meaning,</i> the English people, the French people<i>, &amp;c., many</i> grammarians conceive that <i>English, French</i>, &amp;c., are <i>indeclinable nouns</i>. But in my opinion, it is better to reckon them <i>adjectives</i>, relating to the noun <i>men</i> or <i>people</i> understood. For if these words are nouns, so are a thousand others, after which there is the same ellipsis; as when we say, <i>the good, the great, the wise, the learned</i>.[168] The principle would involve the inconvenience of multiplying our nouns of the singular form and a plural meaning, indefinitely. If they are nouns, they are, in this sense, plural only; and, in an other, they are singular only. For we can no more say, <i>an English, an Irish</i>, or <i>a French</i>, for <i>an Englishman, an</i> Irishman<i>, or</i> a Frenchman<i>; than we can say,</i> an old, a selfish<i>, or</i> a rich<i>, for</i> an old man, a selfish man<i>, or</i> a rich man<i>. Yet, in</i> distinguishing the <i>languages</i>, we call them <i>English, French, Dutch,</i> Scotch, Welsh, Irish<i>; using the words, certainly, in no plural sense; and</i> preferring always the line of adjectives, where the gentile noun is different: as, <i>Arabic</i>, and not <i>Arab</i>; <i>Danish</i>, and not <i>Dane</i>; <i>Swedish</i>, and not <i>Swede</i>. In this sense, as well as in the former, Webster, Chalmers, and other modern lexicographers, call the words <i>nouns</i>; and the reader will perceive, that the objections offered before do not apply here. But Johnson, in his two quarto volumes, gives only two words of this sort, <i>English</i> and <i>Latin</i>; and both of these he calls <i>adjectives</i>: "ENGLISH, <i>adj.</i> Belonging to England; hence English[169] is the language of England." The word <i>Latin</i>, however, he makes a noun, when it means a schoolboy's exercise; for which usage he quotes, the following inaccurate example from Ascham: "He shall not use the common order in schools for making of <i>Latins</i>."</p>
<p>OBS. 3.--Dr. Webster gives us explanations like these: "CHINESE, <i>n. sing.</i> and <i>plu.</i> A native of China; also the language of China."--"JAPANESE, <i>n.</i> A native of Japan; or the language of the inhabitants."--"GENOESE, <i>n. pl.</i> the people of Genoa in Italy. <i>Addison</i>."--"DANISH, <i>n.</i> The language of the Danes."--"IRISH, <i>n.</i> 1. A native of Ireland. 2. The language of the Irish; the Hiberno-Celtic." According to him, then, it is proper to say, <i>a</i> Chinese, a Japanese<i>, or</i> an Irish<i>; but not,</i> a Genoese<i>, because he will</i> have this word to be plural only! Again, if with him we call a native of Ireland <i>an Irish</i>, will not more than one be <i>Irishes?</i>[170] If a native of Japan be <i>a Japanese</i>, will not more than one be <i>Japaneses?</i> In short, is it not plain, that the words, <i>Chinese, Japanese, Portuguese, Maltese,</i> Genoese, Milanese<i>, and all others of like formation, should follow one and</i> the same rule? And if so, what is that rule? Is it not this;--that, like <i>English, French</i>, &amp;c., they are always <i>adjectives</i>; except, perhaps, when they denote <i>languages</i>? There may possibly be some real authority from usage, for calling a native of China <i>a Chinese</i>,--of Japan <i>a</i> Japanese<i>,--&amp;c.; as there is also for the regular plurals,</i> Chineses, Japaneses<i>, &amp;c.; but is it, in either case, good and sufficient authority?</i> The like forms, it is acknowledged, are, on some occasions, mere adjectives; and, in modern usage, we do not find these words inflected, as they were formerly. Examples: "The <i>Chinese</i> are by no means a cleanly people, either in person or dress."--<i>Balbi's Geog.</i>, p. 415. "The <i>Japanese</i> excel in working in copper, iron, and steel."--<i>Ib.</i>, p. 419. "The <i>Portuguese</i> are of the same origin with the Spaniards."--<i>Ib.</i>, p. 272. "By whom the undaunted <i>Tyrolese</i> are led."--<i>Wordsworth's Poems</i>, p. 122. Again: "Amongst the <i>Portugueses</i>, 'tis so much a Fashion, and Emulation, amongst their Children, to <i>learn</i> to <i>Read</i>, and Write, that they cannot hinder them from it."--<i>Locke, on Education</i>, p. 271. "The <i>Malteses</i> do so, who harden the Bodies of their Children, and reconcile them to the Heat, by making them go stark Naked."--<i>Idem, Edition of</i> 1669, p. 5. "CHINESE, <i>n. s</i>. Used elliptically for the language and people of China: plural, <i>Chineses. Sir T. Herbert</i>."--<i>Abridgement of Todd's</i> Johnson<i>. This is certainly absurd. For if</i> Chinese <i>is used</i> elliptically for the people of China, it is an <i>adjective</i>, and does not form the plural, <i>Chineses</i>: which is precisely what I urge concerning the whole class. These plural forms ought not to be imitated. Horne Tooke quotes some friend of his, as saying, "No, I will never descend with him beneath even <i>a Japanese</i>: and I remember what Voltaire remarks of <i>that</i> country<i>."--</i>Diversions of Purley<i>, i, 187. In this case, he ought,</i> unquestionably, to have said--"beneath even <i>a native of Japan</i>;" because, whether <i>Japanese</i> be a noun or not, it is absurd to call <i>a Japanese</i>, "<i>that country</i>." Butler, in his Hudibras, somewhere uses the word <i>Chineses</i>; and it was, perhaps, in his day, common; but still, I say, it is contrary to analogy, and therefore wrong. Milton, too, has it:</p>
<pre>  "But in his way lights on the barren plains
   Of Sericana, where Chineses[171]  drive
   With sails and wind their cany <i>waggons</i> light."
       --<i>Paradise Lost</i>, B. iii, l. 437.

<p>OBS. 4.--The Numeral Adjectives are of three kinds, namely, <i>cardinal,</i> ordinal<i>, and</i> multiplicative<i>: each kind running on in a series</i> indefinitely. Thus:--</p>
<p>1. <i>Cardinal</i>; One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, nineteen, twenty, twenty-one, twenty-two, &amp;c.</p>
<p>2. <i>Ordinal</i>; First, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, tenth, eleventh, twelfth, thirteenth, fourteenth, fifteenth, sixteenth, seventeenth, eighteenth, nineteenth, twentieth, twenty-first, twenty-second, &amp;c.</p>
<p>3. <i>Multiplicative</i>; Single or alone, double or twofold, triple or threefold, quadruple or fourfold, quintuple or fivefold, sextuple or sixfold, septuple or sevenfold, octuple or eightfold, &amp;c. But high terms of this series are seldom used. All that occur above decuple or tenfold, are written with a hyphen, and are usually of round numbers only; as, thirty-fold, sixty-fold, hundred-fold.</p>
<p>OBS. 5.--A cardinal numeral denotes the whole number, but the corresponding ordinal denotes only the last one of that number, or, at the beginning of a series, the first of several or many. Thus: "<i>One</i> denotes simply the number <i>one</i>, without any regard to more; but <i>first</i> has respect to more, and so denotes only the first one of a greater number; and <i>two</i> means the number <i>two</i> completely; but <i>second</i>, the last one of <i>two</i>: and so of all the rest."--<i>Burn's Gram.</i>, p. 54. A cardinal number answers to the question, "<i>How many</i>?" An ordinal number answers to the question, "<i>Which</i> one<i>?" or, "</i>What one<i>?" All the ordinal numbers, except</i> first, second, third<i>, and the compounds of these, as</i> twenty-first, twenty-second, twenty-third<i>, are formed directly from the cardinal numbers by means of</i> the termination <i>th</i>. And as the primitives, in this case, are many of them either compound words, or phrases consisting of several words, it is to be observed, that the addition is made to the last term only. That is, of every compound ordinal number, the last term only is ordinal in form. Thus we say, <i>forty-ninth</i>, and not <i>fortieth-ninth</i>; nor could the meaning of the phrase, <i>four hundred and fiftieth</i>, be expressed by saying, <i>fourth</i> hundredth and fiftieth<i>; for this, if it means any thing, speaks of three</i> different numbers.</p>
<p>OBS. 6.--Some of the numerals are often used as <i>nouns</i>; and, as such, are regularly declined: as, <i>Ones, twoes, threes, fours, fives</i>, &amp;c. So, <i>Fifths, sixths, sevenths, eighths, ninths, tenths</i>, &amp;c. "The <i>seventy's</i> translation."--<i>Wilson's Hebrew Gram.</i>, p. 32. "I will not do it for <i>forty's</i> sake."--<i>Gen.</i>, xviii, 29. "I will not destroy it for <i>twenty's</i> sake."--<i>Ib.</i>, ver. 31. "For <i>ten's</i> sake."--<i>Ib.</i>, ver. 32. "They sat down in ranks, by <i>hundreds</i>, and by <i>fifties</i>."--<i>Mark</i>, vi, 40. "There are <i>millions</i> of truths that a man is not concerned to know."--<i>Locke</i>. With the compound numerals, such a construction is less common; yet the denominator of a fraction may be a number of this sort: as, seven <i>twenty-fifths</i>. And here it may be observed, that, in stead of the ancient phraseology, as in 1 Chron., xxiv, 17th, "The <i>one and twentieth</i> to Jachin, the <i>two and twentieth</i> to Gamul, the <i>three and twentieth</i> to Delaiah, the <i>four and twentieth</i> to Maaziah," we now generally say, <i>the</i> twenty-first, the twenty-second<i>, &amp;c.; using the hyphen in all compounds</i> till we arrive at <i>one hundred</i>, or <i>one hundredth</i>, and then first introducing the word <i>and</i>; as, <i>one hundred and one</i>, or <i>one hundred and</i> first<i>, &amp;c.</i></p>
<p>OBS. 7.--The Pronominal Adjectives are comparatively very few; but frequency of use gives them great importance in grammar. The following words are perhaps all that properly belong to this class, and several of these are much oftener something else: <i>All, any, both, certain, divers,</i> each, either, else, enough, every, few, fewer, fewest, former, first, latter, last, little, less, least, many, more, most, much, neither, no <i>or</i> <i>none, one, other, own, only, same, several, some, such, sundry, that,</i> this, these, those, what, whatever, whatsoever, which, whichever, whichsoever<i>.[172] Of these forty-six words, seven are always singular, if</i> the word <i>one</i> is not an exception; namely, <i>each, either, every, neither,</i> one, that, this<i>: and nine or ten others are always plural, if the word</i> <i>many</i> is not an exception; namely, <i>both, divers, few, fewer, fewest,</i> many, several, sundry, these, those<i>. All the rest, like our common</i> adjectives, are applicable to nouns of either number. <i>Else, every, only,</i> no<i>, and</i> none<i>, are definitive words, which I have thought proper to call</i> pronominal adjectives, though only the last can now with propriety be made to represent its noun understood. "Nor has Vossius, or <i>any else</i> that I know of, observed it."--<i>Johnson's Gram. Com.</i>, p. 279. Say, "or any <i>one</i> else." Dr. Webster explains this word <i>else</i> thus: "ELSE, <i>a.</i> or <i>pron.</i> [Sax. <i>elles</i>] Other; one or something <i>beside</i>; as, Who <i>else</i> is coming?"--<i>Octavo Dict.</i> "Each and <i>every</i> of them," is an old phrase in which <i>every</i> is used pronominally, or with ellipsis of the word to which it refers; but, in common discourse, we now say, <i>every one, every man</i>, &amp;c., never using the word <i>every</i> alone to suggest its noun. <i>Only</i> is perhaps most commonly an adverb; but it is still in frequent use as an adjective; and in old books we sometimes find an ellipsis of the noun to which it belongs; as, "Neither are they the <i>only</i> [verbs] in which it is read."--<i>Johnson's Grammatical Commentaries</i>, p. 373. "But I think he is the <i>only</i> [one] of these Authors."--<i>Ib.</i>, p. 193. <i>No</i> and <i>none</i> seem to be only different forms of the same adjective; the former being used before a noun expressed, and the latter when the noun is understood, or not placed after the adjective; as, "For <i>none</i> of us liveth to himself, and <i>no</i> man dieth to himself."--<i>Romans</i>, xiv, 7. <i>None</i> was anciently used for <i>no</i> before all words beginning with a vowel sound; as, "They are sottish children; and they have <i>none</i> understanding."--<i>Jeremiah</i>, iv, 22. This practice is now obsolete. <i>None</i> is still used, when its noun precedes it; as,</p>
<pre>  "Fools! who from hence into the notion fall,
   That <i>vice</i> or <i>virtue</i> there is <i>none</i> at all."--<i>Pope</i>.
</pre>
<p>OBS. 8.--Of the words given in the foregoing list as pronominal adjectives, about one third are sometimes used <i>adverbially</i>. They are the following: <i>All</i>, when it means <i>totally; any</i>, for <i>in any degree; else</i>, meaning <i>otherwise; enough</i>, signifying <i>sufficiently; first</i>, for <i>in the first</i> place; last<i>, for</i> in the last place; little<i>, for</i> in a small degree; less<i>, for</i> in a smaller degree; least<i>, for</i> in the smallest degree; much<i>, for</i> in a great degree; more<i>, for</i> in a greater degree; most<i>, for</i> <i>in the greatest degree; no</i>, or <i>none</i>, for <i>in no degree; only</i>, for <i>singly, merely, barely; what</i>, for <i>in what degree</i>, or <i>in how great a</i> degree<i>.[173] To these may perhaps be added the word</i> other<i>, when used as</i> an alternative to <i>somehow</i>; as, "<i>Somehow</i> or <i>other</i> he will be favoured."--<i>Butler's Analogy</i>, p. 89. Here <i>other</i> seems to be put for <i>otherwise</i>; and yet the latter word would not be agreeable in such a sentence. "<i>Somewhere or other</i>," is a kindred phrase equally common, and equally good; or, rather, equally irregular and puzzling. Would it not be better, always to avoid both, by saying, in their stead, "<i>In some way or</i> other<i>,"--"</i>In someplace or other?<i>" In the following examples, however,</i> <i>other</i> seems to be used for <i>otherwise</i>, without such a connection: "How is THAT used, <i>other</i> than as a Conjunction?"--<i>Ainsworth's Gram.</i>, p. 88.</p>
<pre>  "Will it not be receiv'd that they have done 't?
   --Who dares receive it <i>other?</i>"--SHAK.: <i>Joh. Dict., w. Other</i>.
</pre>
<p>OBS. 9.--<i>All</i> and <i>enough, little</i> and <i>much, more</i> and <i>less</i>, sometimes suggest the idea of quantity so abstractly, that we can hardly consider them as adjuncts to any other words; for which reason, they are, in this absolute sense, put down in our dictionaries as <i>nouns</i>. If nouns, however, they are never inflected by cases or numbers; nor do they in general admit the usual adjuncts or definitives of nouns.[174] Thus, we can neither say, <i>the all</i>, for <i>the whole</i>, nor <i>an enough</i>, for <i>a sufficiency</i>. And though <i>a little, the more</i>, and <i>the less</i>, are common phrases, the article does not here prove the following word to be a noun; because the expression may either be elliptical, or have the construction of an adverb: as, "Though <i>the more</i> abundantly I love you, <i>the less</i> I be loved."--<i>2</i> Cor.<i>, xii, 15. Dr. Johnson seems to suppose that the partitive use of</i> these words makes them nouns; as, "They have <i>much of the poetry</i> of Mecænas, but <i>little of his liberality</i>."--DRYDEN: <i>in Joh. Dict.</i> Upon this principle, however, adjectives innumerable would be made nouns; for we can just as well say, "<i>Some of the poetry</i>,"--"<i>Any of the</i> poetry<i>,"--"</i>The best of Poetry<i>," &amp;c. In all such expressions, the name of</i> the thing divided, is understood in the partitive word; for a part of any thing must needs be of the same species as the whole. Nor was this great grammarian sufficiently attentive to adjuncts, in determining the parts of speech. <i>Nearly all, quite enough, so little, too much, vastly more, rather</i> less<i>, and an abundance of similar phrases, are familiar to every body; in</i> none of which, can any of these words of quantity, however abstract, be very properly reckoned nouns; because the preceding word is an adverb, and adverbs do not relate to any words that are literally nouns. All these may also be used partitively; as, "<i>Nearly all of us</i>."</p>
<p>OBS. 10.--The following are some of Dr. Johnson's "<i>nouns</i>;" which, in connexion with the foregoing remarks, I would submit to the judgement of the reader: "'Then shall we be news-crammed.'--'<i>All</i> the better; we shall be the more remarkable.'"--SHAK.: <i>in Joh. Dict.</i> "<i>All</i> the fitter, Lentulus; our coming is not for salutation; we have business."--BEN JONSON: <i>ib.</i> "'Tis <i>enough</i> for me to have endeavoured the union of my country."--TEMPLE: <i>ib.</i> "Ye take too <i>much</i> upon you."--NUMBERS: <i>ib.</i> "The fate of love is such, that still it sees too <i>little</i> or too <i>much</i>."--DRYDEN: <i>ib.</i> "He thought not <i>much</i> to clothe his enemies."--MILTON: <i>ib.</i> "There remained not so <i>much</i> as one of them."--<i>Ib., Exod.</i>, xiv, 28. "We will cut wood out of Lebanon, as <i>much</i> as thou shalt need."--<i>Ib.</i>, <i>2 Chronicles</i>. "The matter of the universe was created before the flood; if any <i>more</i> was created, then there must be as <i>much</i> annihilated to make room for it."--BURNET: <i>ib.</i> "The Lord do so, and much <i>more</i>, to Jonathan."--1 SAMUEL: <i>ib.</i> "They that would have <i>more</i> and <i>more</i>, can never have <i>enough</i>; no, not if a miracle should interpose to gratify their avarice."--L'ESTRANGE: <i>ib.</i> "They gathered some <i>more</i>, some <i>less</i>."--EXODUS: <i>ib.</i> "Thy servant knew nothing of this, <i>less</i> or <i>more</i>."--1 SAMUEL: <i>ib.</i> The first two examples above, Johnson explains thus: "That is, <b>Every thing is the better<i>.'--</i>Every thing is</b> the fitter<i>."--</i>Quarto Dict. <i>The propriety of this solution may well be</i> doubted; because the similar phrases, "<i>So much</i> the better,"--"<i>None</i> the fitter," would certainly be perverted, if resolved in the same way: <i>much</i> and <i>none</i> are here, very clearly, adverbs.</p>
<p>OBS. 11.--Whatever disposition may be made of the terms cited above, there are instances in which some of the same words can hardly be any thing else than nouns. Thus <i>all</i>, when it signifies <i>the whole</i>, or <i>every thing</i>, may be reckoned a noun; as, "Our <i>all</i> is at stake, and irretrievably lost, if we fail of success."--<i>Addison</i>. "A torch, snuff and <i>all</i>, goes out in a moment, when dipped in the vapour."--<i>Id.</i> "The first blast of wind laid it flat on the ground; nest, eagles, and <i>all</i>."--<i>L'Estrange</i>.</p>
<pre>  "Finding, the wretched <i>all</i> they here can have,
   But present food, and but a future grave."--<i>Prior</i>.
</pre>
<pre>   "And will she yet debase her eyes on me;
   On me, whose <i>all</i> not equals Edward's moiety?"--<i>Shak</i>.
</pre>
<pre>   "Thou shalt be <i>all</i> in <i>all</i>, and I in thee,
   Forever; and in me all whom thou lov'st."--<i>Milton</i>.
</pre>
<p>OBS. 12.--There are yet some other words, which, by their construction alone, are to be distinguished from the pronominal adjectives. <i>Both</i>, when it stands as a correspondent to <i>and</i>, is reckoned a conjunction; as, "For <i>both</i> he that sanctifieth, <i>and</i> they who are sanctified, are all of one."--<i>Heb.</i>, ii, 11. But, in sentences like the following, it seems to be an adjective, referring to the nouns which precede: "Language and manners are <i>both</i> established by the usage of people of fashion."--<i>Amer.</i> Chesterfield<i>, p. 83. So</i> either<i>, corresponding to</i> or<i>, and</i> neither<i>,</i> referring to <i>nor</i>, are conjunctions, and not adjectives. <i>Which</i> and <i>what</i>, with their compounds, <i>whichever</i> or <i>whichsoever, whatever</i> or <i>whatsoever</i>, though sometimes put before nouns as adjectives, are, for the most part, relative or interrogative pronouns. When the noun is used after them, they are adjectives; when it is omitted, they are pronouns: as, "There is a witness of God, <i>which witness</i> gives true judgement."--<i>I.</i> Penington<i>. Here the word</i> witness <i>might be omitted, and</i> which <i>would</i> become a relative pronoun. Dr. Lowth says, "<i>Thy, my, her, our, your,</i> their<i>, are pronominal adjectives."--</i>Gram.<i>, p. 23. This I deny; and the</i> reader may see my reasons, in the observations upon the declension of pronouns.</p>
<p>OBS. 13.--The words <i>one</i> and <i>other</i>, besides their primitive uses as adjectives, in which they still remain without inflection, are frequently employed as nouns, or as substitutes for nouns; and, in this substantive or pronominal character, they commonly have the regular declension of nouns, and are reckoned such by some grammarians; though others call them indefinite pronouns, and some, (among whom are Lowth and Comly,) leave them with the pronominal adjectives, even when they are declined in both numbers. Each of them may be preceded by either of the articles; and so general is the signification of the former, that almost any adjective may likewise come before it: as, <i>Any one, some one, such a one, many a one, a</i> new one, an old one, an other one, the same one, the young ones, the little ones, the mighty ones, the wicked one, the Holy One, the Everlasting One<i>.</i> So, like the French <i>on</i>, or <i>l'on</i>, the word <i>one</i>, without any adjective, is now very frequently used as a general or indefinite term for any man, or any person. In this sense, it is sometimes, unquestionably, to be preferred to a personal pronoun applied indefinitely: as, "Pure religion, and undefiled before God and the Father, is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep <i>himself</i> [better, <i>one's self</i>] unspotted from the world."--<i>James</i>, i, 27. But, as its generality of meaning seems to afford a sort of covering for egotism, some writers are tempted to make too frequent a use of it. Churchill ridicules this practice, by framing, or anonymously citing, the following sentence: "If <i>one</i> did but dare to abide by <i>one's</i> own judgement, <i>one's</i> language would be much more refined; but <i>one</i> fancies <i>one's</i> self obliged to follow, whereever the many choose to lead <i>one</i>."--See <i>Churchill's Gram.</i>, p. 229. Here every scholar will concur with the critic in thinking, it would be better to say: "If <i>we</i> did but dare to abide by <i>our</i> own judgement, <i>our</i> language would be much more refined; but <i>we</i> fancy <i>ourselves</i> obliged to follow wherever the many choose to lead <i>us</i>."--See <i>ib.</i></p>
<p>OBS. 14.--Of the pronominal adjectives the following distribution has been made: "<i>Each, every</i>, and <i>either</i>, are called <i>distributives</i>; because, though they imply all the persons or things that make up a number, they consider them, not as one whole, but as taken separately. <i>This, that,</i> former, latter, both, neither<i>, are termed</i> demonstratives<i>; because they</i> point out precisely the subjects to which they relate. <i>This</i> has <i>these</i> for its plural; <i>that</i> has <i>those</i>. <i>This</i> and <i>that</i> are frequently put in opposition to each other; <i>this</i>, to express what is nearer in place or time; <i>that</i>, what is more remote. <i>All, any, one, other, some, such</i>, are termed <i>indefinite</i>. <i>Another</i> is merely <i>other</i> in the singular, with the indefinite article not kept separate from it.[175] <i>Other</i>, when not joined with a noun, is occasionally used both in the possessive case, and in the plural number: as,</p>
<pre>   'Teach me to feel <i>an other's</i> wo, to hide the fault I see;
   That mercy I to <i>others</i> show, that mercy show to me.'--<i>Pope</i>.
</pre>
<p><i>Each other</i> and <i>one another</i>, when used in conjunction, may be termed <i>reciprocals</i>; as they are employed to express a reciprocal action; the former, between two persons or things; the latter, <i>between</i>[176] more than two. The possessive cases of the personal pronouns have been also ranked under the head of pronominal adjectives, and styled possessives; but for this I see no good reason."--<i>Churchill's Gram.</i>, p. 76.</p>
<p>OBS. 15.--The reciprocal terms <i>each other</i> and <i>one an other</i> divide, according to some mutual act or interchangeable relation, the persons or things spoken of, and are commonly of the singular number only. <i>Each</i> other<i>, if rightly used, supposes two, and only two, to be acting and acted</i> upon reciprocally; <i>one an other</i>, if not misapplied, supposes more than two, under like circumstances, and has an indefinite reference to all taken distributively: as, "Brutus and Aruns killed <i>each other</i>." That is, <i>Each</i> combatant <i>killed</i> the other<i>. "The disciples were commanded to love</i> one an other<i>, and to be willing to wash</i> one an other's <i>feet." That is,</i> All the disciples were commanded to love <i>mutually</i>; for both terms, <i>one</i> and <i>other</i>, or <i>one disciple</i> and <i>an other disciple</i>, must be here understood as taken indefinitely. The reader will observe, that the two terms thus brought together, if taken substantively or pronominally in parsing, must be represented as being of <i>different cases</i>; or, if we take them adjectively the noun, which is twice to be supplied, will necessarily be so.</p>
<p>OBS. 16.--Misapplications of the foregoing reciprocal terms are very frequent in books, though it is strange that phrases so very common should not be rightly understood. Dr. Webster, among his explanations of the word <i>other</i>, has the following: "Correlative to <i>each</i>, and applicable to <i>any</i> number <i>of individuals."--</i>Octavo Dict. <i>"</i>Other <i>is used as a substitute</i> for a noun, and in this use has the plural number and the sign of the possessive case."--<i>Ib.</i> Now it is plain, that the word <i>other</i>, as a "correlative to <i>each</i>," may be so far "a substitute for a noun" as to take the form of the possessive case singular, and perhaps also the plural; as, "Lock'd in <i>each other's</i> arms they lay." But, that the objective <i>other</i>, in any such relation, can convey a plural idea, or be so loosely applicable--"to <i>any number</i> of individuals," I must here deny. If it were so, there would be occasion, by the foregoing rule, to make it plural in form; as, "The ambitious strive to excel <i>each others</i>." But this is not English. Nor can it be correct to say of more than two, "They all strive to excel <i>each other</i>." Because the explanation must be, "<i>Each</i> strives to excel <i>other</i>;" and such a construction of the word <i>other</i> is not agreeable to modern usage. <i>Each other</i> is therefore not equivalent to <i>one</i> an other<i>, but nearer perhaps to</i> the one the other<i>: as, "The two generals</i> are independent <i>the one of the other</i>."--<i>Voltaire's Charles XII</i>, p. 67. "And these are contrary <i>the one to the other</i>."--<i>Gal.</i>, v, 17. "The necessary connexion <i>of the one with the other</i>."--<i>Blair's Rhet.</i>, p. 304. The latter phraseology, being definite and formal, is now seldom used, except the terms be separated by a verb or a preposition. It is a literal version of the French <i>l'un l'autre</i>, and in some instances to be preferred to <i>each other</i>; as,</p>
<pre>  "So fellest foes, whose plots have broke their sleep,
   To take <i>the one the other</i>, by some chance."--<i>Shak</i>.
</pre>
<p>OBS. 17.--The Greek term for the reciprocals <i>each other</i> and <i>one an</i> other<i>, is a certain plural derivative from [Greek: allos],</i> other<i>; and is</i> used in three cases, the genitive, [Greek: allælon], the dative, [Greek: allælois], the accusative, [Greek: allælous]: these being all the cases which the nature of the expression admits; and for all these we commonly use the <i>objective</i>;--that is, we put <i>each</i> or <i>one</i> before the objective <i>other</i>. Now these English terms, taken in a reciprocal sense, seldom, if ever, have any plural form; because the article in <i>one an other</i> admits of none; and <i>each other</i>, when applied to two persons or things, (as it almost always is,) does not require any. I have indeed seen, in some narrative, such an example as this: "The two men were ready to cut <i>each</i> others' throats<i>." But the meaning could not be, that each was ready to cut</i> "<i>others' throats</i>;" and since, between the two, there was but one throat for <i>each</i> to cut, it would doubtless be more correct to say, "<i>each</i> other's throat<i>." So Burns, in touching a gentler passion, has an</i> inaccurate elliptical expression:</p>
<pre>  "'Tis when a youthful, loving, modest pair,
   In <i>others'</i> arms, breathe out the tender tale."
       --<i>Cotter's Sat. Night</i>.
</pre>
<p>He meant, "In <i>each other's</i> arms;" the apostrophe being misplaced, and the metre improperly allowed to exclude a word which the sense requires. Now, as to the plural of <i>each other</i>, although we do not use the objective, and say of many, "They love <i>each others</i>," there appear to be some instances in which the possessive plural, <i>each others'</i>, would not be improper; as, "Sixteen ministers, who meet weekly at <i>each other's</i> houses."--<i>Johnson's</i> Life of Swift<i>. Here the singular is wrong, because the governing noun</i> implies a plurality of owners. "The citizens of different states should know <i>each others characters</i>."--<i>Webster's Essays</i>, p. 35. This also is wrong, because no possessive sign is used. Either write, "<i>each others'</i> characters<i>," or say, "</i>one an other's character<i>."</i></p>
<p>OBS. 18.--<i>One</i> and <i>other</i> are, in many instances, terms relative and partitive, rather than reciprocal; and, in this use, there seems to be an occasional demand for the plural form. In French, two parties are contrasted by <i>les uns--les autres</i>; a mode of expression seldom, if ever imitated in English. Thus: "Il les séparera <i>les uns</i> d'avec <i>les autres</i>." That is, "He shall separate them <i>some</i> from <i>others</i>;"--or, literally, "<i>the ones</i> from <i>the others</i>." Our version is: "He shall separate them <i>one from an other</i>."--<i>Matt.</i>, xxv, 32. Beza has it: "Separabit eos <i>alteros ab alteris</i>." The Vulgate: "Separabit eos <i>ab invicem</i>." The Greek: "[Greek: Aphoriei autous ap allælon]." To separate many "<i>one from</i> an other<i>," seems, literally, to leave none of them together; and this is</i> not, "as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats." To express such an idea with perfect propriety, in our language, therefore, we must resort to some other phraseology. In Campbell's version, we read: "And <i>out of them</i> he will separate <i>the good from the bad</i>, as a shepherd separateth <i>the</i> sheep from the goats." Better, perhaps, thus: "And he shall separate them, <i>the righteous from the wicked</i>, as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats."</p>
<p>OBS. 19.--Dr. Bullions says, "<i>One</i> and <i>other</i> refer to <i>the singular</i> only<i>."--</i>Eng. Gram.<i>, p. 98. Of</i> ones <i>and</i> others <i>he takes no notice;</i> nor is he sufficiently attentive to usage in respect to the roots. If there is any absurdity in giving a <i>plural</i> meaning to the singulars <i>one</i> and <i>other</i>, the following sentences need amendment: "<i>The one</i> preach Christ of contention; but <i>the other</i>, of love."--<i>Philippians</i>, i, 16. Here "<i>the</i> one<i>" is put for "the one</i> class<i>," and "</i>the other<i>" for "the other</i> <i>class</i>;" the ellipsis in the first instance not being a very proper one. "The confusion arises, when <i>the one</i> will put <i>their</i> sickle into <i>the</i> other's <i>harvest."--LESLEY:</i> in Joh. Dict. <i>This may be corrected by</i> saying, "<i>the one party</i>," or, "<i>the one nation</i>," in stead of "<i>the one</i>." "It is clear from Scripture, that Antichrist shall be permitted to work false miracles, and that they shall so counterfeit the true, that it will be hard to discern <i>the one</i> from <i>the other</i>."--<i>Barclay's Works</i>, iii, 93. If in any ease we may adopt the French construction above, "<i>the ones</i> from the <i>others</i>," it will be proper here. Again: "I have seen <i>children</i> at a table, who, whatever was there, never asked for any thing, but contentedly took what was given them: and, at an other place, I have seen <i>others</i> cry for every thing they saw; they must be served out of every dish, and that first too. What made this vast difference, but this: That <i>one was</i> accustomed to have what <i>they</i> called or cried for; <i>the other</i> to go without it?"--<i>Locke, on Education</i>, p. 55. Here, (with <i>were</i> for <i>was</i>,) the terms of contrast ought rather to have been, <i>the ones--the</i> others<i>;</i> the latter--the former<i>; or,</i> the importunate--the modest<i>.</i> "Those nice shades, by which <i>virtues and vices</i> approach <i>each one</i> another<i>."--</i>Murray's Gram.<i>, i, p. 350. This expression should be any</i> thing, rather than what it is. Say, "By which <i>virtue</i> and <i>vice</i> approach <i>each other</i>." Or: "By which certain virtues and vices <i>approximate--</i> blend--become difficult of distinction<i>."</i></p>
<p>OBS. 20.--"Most authors have given the name of <i>pronoun adjectives</i>, ['pronouns adjective,' or 'pronominal adjectives,'] to <i>my, mine; our,</i> ours; thy, thine; your, yours; his, her, hers; their, theirs<i>: perhaps</i> because they are followed by, or refer to, some substantive [expressed or understood after them]. But, were they adjectives, they must either express the quality of their substantive, or limit its extent: adjectives properly so called, do the first; definitive pronouns do the last. All adjectives [that are either singular or plural,] agree with their substantives in <i>number</i>; but I can say, 'They are <i>my books</i>:' <i>my</i> is singular, and <i>books</i> plural; therefore <i>my</i> is not an adjective. Besides, <i>my</i> does not express the <i>quality</i> of the books, but only ascertains the possessor, the same as the genitive or substantive does, to which it is similar. Examples: 'They are <i>my</i> books;'--'They are <i>John's</i> books;' &amp;c."--<i>Alex. Murray's</i> Gram.<i>, p. 108.</i></p>
<p>OBS. 21.--To the class of Participial Adjectives, should be referred all such words as the following: (1.) The simple participles made adjectives by position; as. "A <i>roaring</i> lion,"--"A <i>raging</i> bear,"--"A <i>brawling</i> woman,"--"A <i>flattering</i> mouth,"--"An <i>understanding</i> heart,"--"<i>Burning</i> coals,"--"The <i>hearing</i> ear, and the <i>seeing</i> eye."--<i>Bible</i>. "A <i>troubled</i> fountain,"--"A <i>wounded</i> spirit,"--"An <i>appointed</i> time."--<i>Ib.</i> (2.) Words of a participial appearance, formed from nouns by adding <i>ed</i>; as, "The eve thy <i>sainted</i> mother died."--<i>W. Scott</i>. "What you write of me, would make me more <i>conceited</i>, than what I scribble myself."--<i>Pope</i>. (3.) Participles, or participial adjectives, reversed in sense by the prefix <i>un</i>; as, <i>unaspiring, unavailing, unbelieving, unbattered, uninjured,</i> unbefriended<i>. (4.) Words of a participial form construed elliptically, as</i> if they were nouns; as, "Among the <i>dying</i> and the dead."--"The <i>called</i> of Jesus Christ."--<i>Rom.</i>, i, 6. "Dearly <i>beloved</i>, I beseech you."--<i>1 Pet.</i>, ii, 11. "The <i>redeemed</i> of the Lord shall return."--<i>Isaiah</i>, li, 11. "They talk, to the grief of thy <i>wounded</i>."--<i>Psalms</i>, lxix, 26: <i>Margin</i>.</p>
<p>OBS. 22.--In the text, Prov., vii, 26, "She hath cast down many wounded," <i>wounded</i> is a participle; because the meaning is, "<i>many men wounded</i>," and not, "<i>many wounded men</i>." Our Participial Adjectives are exceedingly numerous. It is not easy to ascertain how many there are of them; because almost any simple participle may be set before a noun, and thus become an adjective: as,</p>
<pre>  "Where <i>smiling</i> spring its earliest visit paid,
   And <i>parting</i> summer's <i>ling'ring</i> blooms delay'd."--<i>Goldsmith</i>.
</pre>
<p>OBS. 23.--Compound Adjectives, being formed at pleasure, are both numerous and various. In their formation, however, certain analogies may be traced: (1.) Many of them are formed by joining an adjective to its noun, and giving to the latter the participial termination <i>ed</i>; as, <i>able-bodied,</i> sharp-sighted, left-handed, full-faced, flat-nosed, thick-lipped, cloven-footed, high-heeled<i>. (2.) In some, two nouns are joined, the latter</i> assuming <i>ed</i>, as above; as, <i>bell-shaped, hawk-nosed, eagle-sighted,</i> lion-hearted, web-footed<i>. (3.) In some, the object of an active participle</i> is placed before it; as, <i>money-getting, time-serving, self-consuming,</i> cloud-compelling, fortune-hunting, sleep-disturbing<i>. (4.) Some, embracing</i> numerals, form a series, though it is seldom carried far; as, <i>one-legged,</i> two-legged, three-legged, four-legged<i>. So,</i> one-leaved, two-leaved, three-leaved, four-leaved<i>: or, perhaps better as Webster will have them,</i> <i>one-leafed, two-leafed, &amp;c</i>. But, upon the same principle, <i>short-lived</i>, should be <i>short-lifed</i>, and <i>long-lived, long-lifed</i>. (5.) In some, there is a combination of an adjective and a participle; as, <i>noble-looking,</i> high-sounding, slow-moving, thorough-going, hard-finished, free-born, heavy-laden, only-begotten<i>. (6.) In some, we find an adverb and a</i> participle united; as, <i>ever-living, ill-judging, well-pleasing,</i> far-shooting, forth-issuing, back-sliding, ill-trained, down-trodden, above-mentioned<i>. (7.) Some consist of a noun and a participle which might</i> be reversed with a preposition between them; as, <i>church-going,</i> care-crazed, travel-soiled, blood-bespotted, dew-sprinkled<i>. (8.) A few,</i> and those inelegant, terminate with a preposition; as, <i>unlooked-for,</i> long-looked-for, unthought-of, unheard-of<i>. (9.) Some are phrases of many</i> words, converted into one part of speech by the hyphen; as, "Where is the <i>ever-to-be-honoured</i> Chaucer?"--<i>Wordsworth</i>.</p>
<pre>  "And, with <i>God-only-knows-how-gotten</i> light,
   Informs the nation what is wrong or right."
       --<i>Snelling's Gift for Scribblers</i>, p. 49.
</pre>
<p>OBS. 24.--Nouns derived from compound adjectives, are generally disapproved by good writers; yet we sometimes meet with them: as, <i>hard-heartedness</i>, for hardness of heart, or cruelty; <i>quick-sightedness</i>, for quickness of sight, or perspicacity; <i>worldly-mindedness</i>, for devotion to the world, or love of gain; <i>heavenly-mindedness</i>, for the love of God, or true piety. In speaking of ancestors or descendants, we take the noun, <i>father, mother,</i> son, daughter<i>, or</i> child<i>; prefix the adjective</i> grand<i>; for the second</i> generation; <i>great</i>, for the, third; and then, sometimes, repeat the same, for degrees more remote: as, <i>father, grandfather, great-grandfather,</i> great-great-grandfather<i>. "What would my</i> great-grandmother <i>say, thought</i> I, could she know that thou art to be chopped up for fuel to warm the frigid fingers of her <i>great-great-great-granddaughters</i>!"--<i>T. H.</i> Bayley<i>.</i></p>
<p><br>
MODIFICATIONS.</p>
<p>Adjectives have, commonly, no modifications but the forms of <i>comparison</i>. Comparison is a variation of the adjective, to express quality in different degrees: as, <i>hard, harder, hardest; soft, softer, softest.</i></p>
<p>There are three degrees of comparison; the <i>positive</i>, the <i>comparative</i>, and the <i>superlative</i>.</p>
<p>The <i>positive degree</i> is that which is expressed by the adjective in its simple form: as, "An elephant is <i>large</i>; a mouse, <i>small</i>; a lion, <i>fierce, active, bold</i>, and <i>strong</i>."</p>
<p>The <i>comparative degree</i> is that which is <i>more</i> or <i>less</i> than something contrasted with it: as, "A whale is <i>larger</i> than an elephant; a mouse is a much <i>smaller</i> animal than a rat."</p>
<p>The <i>superlative degree</i> is that which is <i>most</i> or <i>least</i> of all included with it: as, "The whale is the <i>largest</i> of the animals that inhabit this globe; the mouse is the <i>smallest</i> of all beasts."--<i>Dr. Johnson.</i></p>
<p>Those adjectives whose signification does not admit of different degrees, cannot be compared; as, <i>two, second, all, every, immortal, infinite.</i></p>
<p>Those adjectives which may be varied in sense, but not in form, are compared by means of adverbs; as, fruitful, <i>more</i> fruitful, <i>most</i> fruitful--fruitful, <i>less</i> fruitful, <i>least</i> fruitful.</p>
<p><br>
OBSERVATIONS.</p>
<p>OBS. 1.--"Some scruple to call the positive a degree of comparison; on the ground, that it does not imply either comparison, or degree. But no quality can exist, without existing in some degree: and, though the positive is very frequently used without reference to any other degree; as it is <i>the</i> standard<i>, with which other degrees of the quality are compared, it is</i> certainly an essential object of the comparison. While these critics allow only two degrees, we might in fact with more propriety say, that there are five: 1, the quality in its standard state, or positive degree; as <i>wise</i>: 2, in a higher state, or the comparative ascending; <i>more wise</i>: 3, in a lower, or the comparative descending; <i>less wise</i>: 4, in the highest state, or superlative ascending; <i>most wise</i>: 5, in the lowest state, or superlative descending; <i>least wise.</i> All grammarians, however, agree about the things themselves, and the forms used to express them; though they differ about the names, by which these forms should be called: and as those names are practically best, which tend least to perplex the learner, I see no good reason here for deviating from what has been established by long custom."--<i>Churchill's Gram.</i>, p. 231.</p>
<p>OBS. 2.--Churchill here writes plausibly enough, but it will be seen, both from his explanation, and from the foregoing definitions of the degrees of comparison, that there are but three. The comparative and the superlative may each be distinguishable into the ascending and the descending, as often as we prefer the adverbial form to the regular variation of the adjective itself; but this imposes no necessity of classing and defining them otherwise than simply as the comparative and the superlative. The assumption of two comparatives and two superlatives, is not only contrary to the universal practice of the teachers of grammar; but there is this conclusive argument against it--that the regular method of comparison has no degrees of diminution, and the form which has such degrees, is <i>no</i> inflection <i>of the adjective. If there is any exception, it is in the</i> words, <i>small, smaller, smallest</i>, and <i>little, less, least</i>. But of the smallness or littleness, considered abstractly, these, like all others, are degrees of increase, and not of diminution. <i>Smaller</i> is as completely opposite to <i>less small</i>, as <i>wiser</i> is to <i>less wise</i>. <i>Less</i> itself is a comparative descending, only when it diminishes some <i>other</i> quality: <i>less</i> little<i>, if the phrase were proper, must needs be nearly equivalent to</i> <i>greater</i> or <i>more</i>. Churchill, however, may be quite right in the following remark: "The comparative ascending of an adjective, and the comparative descending of an adjective expressing the opposite quality, are often considered synonymous, by those who do not discriminate nicely between ideas. But <i>less imprudent</i> does not imply precisely the same thing as <i>more prudent</i>; or <i>more brave</i>, the same as <i>less cowardly</i>."--<i>New</i> Gram.<i>, p. 231.</i></p>
<p>OBS. 3.--The definitions which I have given of the three degrees of comparison, are new. In short, I know not whether any other grammarian has ever given what may justly be called a <i>definition</i>, of any one of them. Here, as in most other parts of grammar, loose <i>remarks</i>, ill-written and untrue assertions, have sufficed. The explanations found in many English grammars are the following: "The positive state expresses the quality of an object, without any increase or diminution; as, good, wise, great. The comparative degree increases or lessens the positive in signification; as, wiser, greater, less wise. The superlative degree increases or lessens the positive to the highest or [the] lowest degree; as, wisest, greatest, least wise. The simple word, or positive, becomes [the] comparative by adding <i>r</i> or <i>er</i>; and the superlative by adding <i>st</i> or <i>est</i>, to the end of it. And the adverbs <i>more</i> and <i>most</i>, placed before the adjective, have the same effect; as, wise, <i>more</i> wise, <i>most</i> wise."--<i>Murray's Grammar</i>, 2d Ed., 1796, p. 47. If a man wished to select some striking example of bad writing--of thoughts ill conceived, and not well expressed--he could not do better than take the foregoing: provided his auditors knew enough of grammar to answer the four simple questions here involved; namely, What is the positive degree? What is the comparative degree? What is the superlative degree? How are adjectives regularly compared? To these questions I shall furnish <i>direct answers</i>, which the reader may compare with such as he can derive from the foregoing citation: the last two sentences of which Murray ought to have credited to Dr. Lowth; for he copied them literally, except that he says, "the adverbs <i>more</i> AND <i>most</i>," for the Doctor's phrase, "the adverbs <i>more</i> OR <i>most</i>." See the whole also in <i>Kirkham's Grammar</i>, p. 72; in <i>Ingersoll's</i>, p. 35; in <i>Alger's</i>, p. 21; in <i>Bacon's</i>, p. 18; in <i>Russell's</i>, p. 14; in <i>Hamlin's</i>, p. 22; in <i>J. M. Putnam's</i>, p. 33; in <i>S. Putnam's</i>, p. 20; in <i>R. C. Smith's</i>, p. 51; in <i>Rev. T. Smith's</i>, p. 20.</p>
<p>OBS. 4.--In the five short sentences quoted above, there are more errors, than can possibly be enumerated in ten times the space. For example: (1.) If one should say of a piece of iron, "It grows cold or hot very rapidly," <i>cold</i> and <i>hot</i> could not be in the "<i>positive state</i>," as they define it: because, either the "quality" or the "object," (I know not which,) is represented by them as "without any increase or diminution;" and this would not, in the present case, be true of either; for iron changes in bulk, by a change of temperature. (2.) What, in the first sentence, is erroneously called "the positive <i>state</i>," in the second and the third, is called, "the positive <i>degree</i>;" and this again, in the fourth, is falsely identified with "the simple <i>word</i>." Now, if we suppose the meaning to be, that "the positive state," "the positive degree," or "the simple word," is "without any increase or diminution;" this is expressly contradicted by three sentences out of the five, and implicitly, by one of the others. (3.) Not one of these sentences is <i>true</i>, in the most obvious sense of the words, if in any other; and yet the doctrines they were designed to teach, may have been, in general, correctly gathered from the examples. (4.) The phrase, "<i>positive in signification</i>," is not intelligible in the sense intended, without a comma after <i>positive</i>; and yet, in an armful of different English grammars which contain the passage, I find not one that has a point in that place. (5.) It is not more correct to say, that the comparative or the superlative degree, "increases or lessens the positive," than it would be to aver, that the plural number increases or lessens the singular, or the feminine gender, the masculine. Nor does the superlative mean, what a certain learned Doctor understands by it--namely, "<i>the</i> greatest or least possible degree<i>." If it did, "the</i> thickest <i>parts of</i> his skull," for example, would imply small room for brains; "the <i>thinnest</i>," protect them ill, if there were any. (6.) It is improper to say, "<i>The simple word becomes</i> [the] <i>comparative by adding r or er</i>; and <i>the superlative by adding st or est</i>." The thought is wrong; and nearly all the words are misapplied; as, <i>simple</i> for <i>primitive, adding</i> for <i>assuming</i>, &amp;c. (7.) Nor is it very wise to say, "the adverbs <i>more</i> and <i>most</i>, placed before the adjective, <i>have the same effect</i>:" because it ought to be known, that the effect of the one is very different from that of the other! "<i>The same effect</i>," cannot here be taken for any effect previously described; unless we will have it to be, that these words, <i>more</i> and <i>most</i>, "become comparative by adding <i>r</i> or <i>er</i>; and the superlative by adding <i>st</i> or <i>est</i>, to the end of them:" all of which is grossly absurd. (8.) The repetition of the word <i>degree</i>, in saying, "The superlative <i>degree</i> increases or lessens the positive to the highest or lowest <i>degree</i>," is a disagreeable tautology. Besides, unless it involves the additional error of presenting the same word in different senses, it makes one degree swell or diminish an other <i>to itself</i>; whereas, in the very next sentence, this singular agency is forgotten, and a second equally strange takes its place: "The positive <i>becomes</i> the superlative by adding <i>st</i> or <i>est</i>, to the end of it;" i. e., to the end of <i>itself</i>. Nothing can be more ungrammatical, than is much of the language by which grammar itself is now professedly taught!</p>
<p>OBS. 5.--It has been almost universally assumed by grammarians, that the positive degree is <i>the only standard</i> to which the other degrees can refer; though many seem to think, that the superlative always implies or includes the comparative, and is consequently inapplicable when only two things are spoken of. Neither of these positions is involved in any of the definitions which I have given above. The reader may think what he will about these points, after observing the several ways in which each form may be used. In the phrases, "<i>greater</i> than Solomon,"--"<i>more</i> than a bushel,"--"<i>later</i> than one o'clock," it is not immediately obvious that the positives <i>great, much</i>, and <i>late</i>, are the real terms of contrast. And how is it in the Latin phrases, "<i>Dulcior melle</i>, sweeter than honey,"--"<i>Præstantior auro</i>, better than gold?" These authors will resolve all such phrases thus: "<i>greater</i>, than Solomon <i>was great</i>,"--"<i>more</i>, than a bushel <i>is much</i>," &amp;c. As the conjunction <i>than</i> never governs the objective case, it seems necessary to suppose an ellipsis of some verb after the noun which follows it as above; and possibly the foregoing solution, uncouth as it seems, may, for the English idiom, be the true one: as, "My Father is <i>greater than I</i>."--<i>John</i>, xiv, 28. That is, "My Father is greater <i>than I am</i>;"--or, perhaps, "than I am <i>great</i>." But if it appear that <i>some</i> degree of the same quality must always be contrasted with the comparative, there is still room to question whether this degree must always be that which we call the positive. Cicero, in exile, wrote to his wife: "Ego autem hoc <i>miserior</i> sum, quam tu, quæ es <i>miserrima</i>, quod ipsa calamitas communis est utriusque nostrùm, sed culpa mea propria est."--<i>Epist. ad Fam.</i>, xiv, 3. "But in this I am <i>more wretched</i>, than thou, who art <i>most wretched</i>, that the calamity itself is common to us both, but the fault is all my own."</p>
<p>OBS. 6.--In my Institutes and First Lines of English Grammar, I used the following brief definitions: "The <i>comparative degree</i> is that which exceeds the positive; as, <i>harder, softer, better</i>." "The <i>superlative</i> degree <i>is that which is not exceeded; as,</i> hardest, softest, best<i>." And</i> it is rather for the sake of suggesting to the learner the peculiar <i>application</i> of each of these degrees, than from any decided dissatisfaction with these expressions, that I now present others. The first, however, proceeds upon the common supposition, that the comparative degree of a quality, ascribed to any object, must needs be contrasted with the positive in some other, or with the positive in the same at an other time. This idea may be plausibly maintained, though it is certain that the positive term referred to, is seldom, if ever, allowed to appear. Besides, the comparative or the superlative <i>may</i> appear, and in such a manner as to be, or seem to be, in the point of contrast. Thus: "Objects near our view are apt to be thought <i>greater than those of a larger size</i>, that are more remote."--<i>Locke's Essay</i>, p. 186. Upon the principle above, the explanation here must be, that the meaning is--"<i>greater</i> than those of a larger size <i>are thought great.</i>" "The <i>poor</i> man that loveth Christ, is <i>richer than the richest man</i> in the world, that hates him."--<i>Bunyan's</i> Pilgrim's Progress<i>, p. 86. This must be "</i>richer <i>than the richest man</i> is rich<i>." The riches contemplated here, are of different sorts; and the</i> comparative or the superlative of one sort, may be exceeded by either of these degrees of an other sort, though the same epithet be used for both. So in the following instances: "He that is <i>higher than the highest</i> regardeth; and there be <i>higher than they</i>."--<i>Eccl.</i>, v, 8. That is, "He that is higher than the highest <i>earthly dignitaries</i>, regardeth; and there are higher <i>authorities</i> than <i>these.</i>" "<i>Fairer</i> than aught imagined else <i>fairest</i>."--<i>Pollok</i>. "<i>Sadder than saddest</i> night."--<i>Byron</i>. It is evident that the superlative degree is not, in general, that which <i>cannot</i> be <i>exceeded, but that which, in the actual state of the things included,</i> "<i>is</i> not exceeded." Again, as soon as any given comparative or superlative is, by a further elevation or intension of the quality, surpassed and exceeded, that particular degree, whatever it was, becomes merely positive; for the positive degree of a quality, though it commonly includes the very lowest measure, and is understood to exceed nothing, may at any time <i>equal</i> the very highest. There is no paradox in all this, which is not also in the following simple examples: "<i>Easier</i>, indeed, I was, but far from <i>easy</i>."--<i>Cowper's Life</i>, p. 50.</p>
<pre>  "Who canst the <i>wisest wiser</i> make,
   And babes <i>as wise</i> as they."--<i>Cowper's Poems</i>.
</pre>
<p>OBS. 7.--The relative nature of these degrees deserves to be further illustrated. (1.) It is plain, that the greatest degree of a quality in one thing, may be less than the least in an other; and, consequently, that the least degree in one thing, may be greater than the greatest in an other. Thus, the <i>heaviest</i> wood is <i>less heavy</i> than the <i>lightest</i> of the metals; and the <i>least valuable</i> of the metals is perhaps of <i>more value</i> than the <i>choicest</i> wood. (2.) The comparative degree may increase upon itself, and be repeated to show the gradation. Thus, a man may ascend into the air with a balloon, and rise <i>higher</i>, and <i>higher</i>, and <i>higher</i>, and <i>higher</i>, till he is out of sight. This is no uncommon form of expression, and the intension is from comparative to comparative. (3.) If a ladder be set up for use, one of its rounds will be <i>the highest</i>, and one other will be <i>the lowest</i>, or <i>least high.</i> And as that which is <i>highest</i>, is <i>higher</i> than all the rest, so every one will be <i>higher</i> than all below it. <i>The higher rounds</i>, if spoken of generally, and without definite contrast, will be those in the upper half; <i>the lower rounds</i>, referred to in like manner, will be those in the lower half, or those not far from the ground. <i>The highest rounds</i>, or <i>the lowest</i>, if we indulge such latitude of speech, will be those near the top or the bottom; there being, absolutely, or in <i>strictness</i> of language, but <i>one</i> of each. (4.) If <i>the</i> highest <i>round be removed, or left uncounted, the next becomes the</i> <i>highest</i>, though not <i>so high</i> as the former. For every one is <i>the</i> highest <i>of the number which it completes. All admit this, till we come to</i> <i>three</i>. And, as the third is <i>the highest of the three</i>, I see not why the second is not properly <i>the highest of the two</i>. Yet nearly all our grammarians condemn this phrase, and prefer "<i>the higher of the two</i>." But can they give a <i>reason</i> for their preference? That the comparative degree is implied between the positive and the superlative, so that there must needs be three terms before the latter is applicable, is a doctrine which I deny. And if the second is <i>the higher of the two</i>, because it is <i>higher</i> than the first<i>; is it not also</i> the highest of the two<i>, because it</i> <i>completes the number?</i> (5.) It is to be observed, too, that as our ordinal numeral <i>first</i>, denoting the one which begins a series, and having reference of course to more, is an adjective of the superlative degree, equivalent to <i>foremost</i>, of which it is perhaps a contraction; so <i>last</i> likewise, though no numeral, is a superlative also. (6.) These, like other superlatives, admit of a looser application, and may possibly include more than one thing at the beginning or at the end of a series: as, "<i>The last</i> years <i>of man are often helpless, like</i> the first<i>." (7.) With undoubted</i> propriety, we may speak of <i>the first two, the last two, the first three,</i> the last three<i>, &amp;c.; but to say,</i> the two first, the two last<i>, &amp;c., with</i> this meaning, is obviously and needlessly inaccurate. "<i>The two first men</i> in the nation," may, I admit, be good English; but it can properly be meant only of <i>the two most eminent.</i> In specifying any part of a <i>series</i>, we ought rather to place the cardinal number after the ordinal. (8.) Many of the foregoing positions apply generally, to almost all adjectives that are susceptible of comparison. Thus, it is a common saying, "Take <i>the best</i> first<i>, and</i> all <i>will be</i> best<i>." That is, remove that degree which is now</i> superlative, and the epithet will descend to an other, "<i>the next best.</i>"</p>
<p>OBS. 8.--It is a common assumption, maintained by almost all our grammarians, that the degrees which add to the adjective the terminations <i>er</i> and <i>est</i>, as well as those which are expressed by <i>more</i> and <i>most</i>, indicate an <i>increase</i>, or heightening, of the quality expressed by the positive. If such must needs be their import, it is certainly very improper, to apply them, as many do, to what can be only an approximation to the positive. Thus Dr. Blair: "Nothing that belongs to human nature, is <i>more universal</i> than the relish of beauty of one kind or other."--<i>Lectures</i>, p. 16. "In architecture, the Grecian models were long esteemed <i>the most perfect</i>."--<i>Ib.</i>, p. 20. Again: In his reprehension of Capernaum, the Saviour said, "It shall be <i>more tolerable</i> for the land of Sodom, in the day of judgement, than for thee."--<i>Matt.</i>, xi, 24. Now, although [Greek: anektoteron], <i>more tolerable</i>, is in itself a good comparative, who would dare infer from this text, that in the day of judgement Capernaum shall fare <i>tolerably</i>, and Sodom, <i>still better</i>? There is much reason to think, that the essential nature of these grammatical degrees has not been well understood by those who have heretofore pretended to explain them. If we except those few approximations to sensible qualities, which are signified by such words as <i>whitish,</i> greenish, &amp;c.<i>, there will be found no actual measure, or inherent degree</i> of any quality, to which the simple form of the adjective is not applicable; or which, by the help of intensive adverbs of a positive character, it may not be made to express; and that, too, without becoming either comparative or superlative, in the technical sense of those terms. Thus <i>very white, exceedingly white, perfectly white</i>, are terms quite as significant as <i>whiter</i> and <i>whitest</i>, if not more so. Some grammarians, observing this, and knowing that the Romans often used their superlative in a sense merely intensive, as <i>altissimus</i> for <i>very high</i>, have needlessly divided our English superlative into two, "<i>the definite</i>, and the <i>indefinite</i>;" giving the latter name to that degree which we mark by the adverb <i>very</i>, and the former to that which alone is properly called the superlative. Churchill does this: while, (as we have seen above,) in naming the degrees, he pretends to prefer "what has been established by long custom."--<i>New Gram.</i>, p. 231. By a strange oversight also, he failed to notice, that this doctrine interferes with his scheme of <i>five</i> degrees, and would clearly furnish him with <i>six</i>: to which if he had chosen to add the "<i>imperfect degree</i>" of Dr. Webster, (as <i>whitish, greenish, &amp;c.</i>,) which is recognized by Johnson, Murray, and others, he might have had <i>seven</i>. But I hope my readers will by-and-by believe there is <i>no need</i> of more than <i>three</i>.</p>
<p>OBS. 9.--The true nature of the Comparative degree is this: it denotes either some <i>excess</i> or some <i>relative deficiency</i> of the quality, when one thing or party is compared with an other, in respect to what is in both: as, "Because the foolishness of God is <i>wiser</i> than men; and the weakness of God is <i>stronger</i> than men."--<i>1 Cor.</i>, i, 25. "Few languages are, in fact, <i>more copious</i> than the English."--<i>Blair's Rhet.</i>, p. 87. "Our style is <i>less compact</i> than that of the ancients."--<i>Ib.</i>, p. 88. "They are counted to him <i>less</i> than nothing and vanity."--<i>Isaiah</i>, xl, 17. As the comparatives in a long <i>series</i> are necessarily many, and some of them <i>higher</i> than others, it may be asked, "How can the comparative degree, in this case, be merely 'that which exceeds the positive?'" Or, as our common grammarians prompt me here to say, "May not the comparative degree increase or lessen <i>the comparative</i>, in signification?" The latter form of the question they may answer for themselves; remembering that the comparative <i>may advance from the comparative</i>, step by step, from the second article in the series to the utmost. Thus, three is a higher or greater number than two; but four is higher than three; five, than four; and so on, <i>ad</i> infinitum<i>. My own form of the question I answer thus: "The</i> highest <i>of</i> the <i>higher</i> is not <i>higher</i> than the rest are <i>higher</i>, but simply <i>higher</i> than they are <i>high</i>."</p>
<p>OBS. 10.--The true nature of the Superlative degree is this: it denotes, in a quality, <i>some extreme</i> or <i>unsurpassed extent</i>. It may be used either absolutely, as being without bounds; or relatively, as being confined within any limits we choose to give it. It is equally applicable to that which is naturally unsurpassable, and to that which stands within the narrowest limits of comparison. The <i>heaviest</i> of <i>three feathers</i> would scarcely be thought a <i>heavy</i> thing, and yet the expression is proper; because the weight, whatever it is, is relatively <i>the greatest</i>. The <i>youngest</i> of three persons, may not be <i>very young</i>; nor need we suppose the <i>oldest</i> in a whole college to have arrived at <i>the greatest</i> conceivable age<i>. What then shall be thought of the explanations which our</i> grammarians have given of this degree of comparison? That of Murray I have already criticised. It is ascribed to him, not upon the supposition that he invented it; but because common sense continues to give place to the authority of his name in support of it. Comly, Russell, Alger, Ingersoll, Greenleaf, Fisk, Merchant, Kirkham, T. Smith, R. C. Smith, Hall, Hiley, and many others, have copied it into their grammars, as being better than any definition they could devise. Murray himself unquestionably took it from some obscure pedagogue among the old grammarians. Buchanan, who long preceded him, has nearly the same words: "The Superlative increases or diminishes the Positive in Signification, to the highest or [the] lowest Degree of all."--<i>English Syntax</i>, p. 28. If this is to be taken for a grammatical definition, what definition shall grammar itself bear?</p>
<p>OBS. 11.--Let us see whether our later authors have done better. "The <i>superlative</i> expresses a quality in the greatest or [the] least <i>possible</i> degree; as, <i>wisest, coldest, least wise</i>."--<i>Webster's Old Gram.</i>, p. 13. In his later speculations, this author conceives that the termination <i>ish</i> forms the <i>first</i> degree of comparison; as, "Imperfect, <i>dankish</i>," Pos. <i>dank</i>, Comp. <i>danker</i>, Superl. <i>dankest</i>. "There are therefore <i>four</i> degrees of comparison."--<i>Webster's Philosophical Gram.</i> p. 65. "The <i>fourth</i> denotes the utmost or [the] least degree of a quality; as, <i>bravest, wisest, poorest, smallest</i>. This is called the <i>superlative</i> degree."--<i>Ib.</i>; also his <i>Improved Gram.</i>, 1831, p. 47. "This degree is called the Superlative degree, from its raising the amount of the quality above that of all others."--<i>Webber's Gram.</i>, 1832, p. 26. It is not easy to quote, from any source, a worse sentence than this; if, indeed, so strange a jumble of words can be called a sentence. "<i>From its raising the</i> amount<i>," is in itself a vicious and untranslatable phrase, here put for</i> "<i>because it raises the amount</i>;" and who can conceive of the superlative degree, as "<i>raising the amount of the quality</i> above that of <i>all other</i> qualities<i>?" Or, if it be supposed to mean, "above the amount of all other</i> <i>degrees</i>," what is this amount? Is it that of one and one, the <i>positive</i> and the <i>comparative</i> added numerically? or is it the sum of all the quantities which these may indicate? Perhaps the author meant, "above the amount of all other <i>amounts</i>." If none of these absurdities is here taught, nothing is taught, and the words are nonsense. Again: "The <i>superlative degree</i> increases or diminishes the positive to the highest or [the] lowest degree <i>of which it is susceptible</i>."--<i>Bucke's Classical</i> Gram.<i>, p. 49. "The superlative degree is generally formed by adding</i> st or <i>est</i> to the positive; and denotes <i>the greatest excess</i>."--<i>Nutting's</i> Gram.<i>, p. 33. "The Superlative increases or diminishes the Signification</i> of the Positive or Adjective, to a <i>very high</i> or a <i>very low</i> Degree."--<i>British Gram.</i>, p. 97. What <i>excess</i> of skill, or what <i>very</i> high degree <i>of acuteness, have the</i> brightest <i>and</i> best <i>of these</i> grammarians exhibited? There must be some, if their definitions are <i>true</i>.</p>
<p>OBS. 12.--The common assertion of the grammarians, that the superlative degree is not applicable to two <i>objects</i>,[177] is not only unsupported by any reason in the nature of things, but it is contradicted in practice by almost every man who affirms it. Thus Maunder: "When only two persons or things are spoken of comparatively, to use the superlative is improper: as, 'Deborah, my dear, give those two boys a lump of sugar each; and let Dick's be the largest, because he spoke first.' This," says the critic, "should have been 'larger.'"--<i>Maunder's Gram.</i>, p. 4. It is true, the comparative <i>might</i> here have been used; but the superlative is clearer, and more agreeable to custom. And how can "<i>largest</i>" be wrong, if "<i>first</i>" is right? "Let Dick's be the <i>larger</i>, because he spoke <i>sooner</i>," borders too much upon a different idea, that of <i>proportion</i>; as when we say, "<i>The</i> sooner the better<i>,"--"</i>The more the merrier<i>." So Blair: "When only two</i> things are compared, the comparative degree should be used, and not the superlative."--<i>Practical Gram.</i>, p. 81. "A Trochee has the <i>first</i> syllable accented, and the <i>last</i> unaccented."--<i>Ib.</i>, p. 118. "An Iambus has the first syllable unaccented, and the <i>last</i> accented."--<i>Ibid.</i> These two examples are found also in <i>Jamieson's Rhetoric</i>, p. 305; <i>Murray's</i> Gram.<i>, p. 253;</i> Kirkham's<i>, 219;</i> Bullions's<i>, 169;</i> Guy's<i>, 120;</i> <i>Merchant's</i>, 166. So Hiley: "When <i>two</i> persons or things are compared, the <i>comparative</i> degree must be employed. When <i>three or more</i> persons or things are compared, the <i>superlative</i> must be used."--<i>Treatise on English</i> Gram.<i>, p. 78. Contradiction in practice: "Thomas is</i> wiser <i>than his</i> brothers."--<i>Ib.</i>, p. 79. Are not "<i>three or more persons</i>" here compared by "the comparative" <i>wiser</i>? "In an <i>Iambus</i> the <i>first</i> syllable is unaccented."--<i>Ib.</i>, p. 123. An iambus has but <i>two</i> syllables; and this author expressly teaches that "<i>first</i>" is "superlative."--<i>Ib.</i>, p. 21. So Sanborn: "The <i>positive</i> degree denotes the <i>simple</i> form of an adjective <i>without</i> any variation of meaning. The <i>comparative</i> degree increases or lessens the meaning <i>of the positive</i>, and denotes a comparison <i>between</i> two <i>persons or things. The</i> superlative <i>degree increases or lessens the</i> positive <i>to the greatest extent</i>, and denotes a comparison <i>between more</i> than two <i>persons or things."--</i>Analytical Gram.<i>, p. 30 and p. 86. These</i> pretended definitions of the degrees of comparison embrace not only the absurdities which I have already censured in those of our common grammars, but several new ones peculiar to this author. Of the inconsistency of his doctrine and practice, take the following examples: "Which of two bodies, that move with the same velocity, will exercise the <i>greatest</i> power?"--<i>Ib.</i>, p. 93; and again, p. 203, "'I was offered a <i>dollar</i>;'--'A <i>dollar</i> was offered (to) <i>me</i>.' The <i>first</i> form should always be avoided."--<i>Ib.</i>, p. 127. "Nouns in apposition generally annex the sign of the possessive case to the <i>last</i>; as, 'For David my <i>servant's</i> sake.'--'John the <i>Baptist's</i> head.' <i>Bible</i>."--<i>Ib.</i>, p. 197.</p>
<p>OBS. 13.--So Murray: "We commonly say, 'This is the <i>weaker of the two</i>;' or, 'The <i>weakest</i> of the two;'[178] but the former is the regular mode of expression, because there are <i>only two</i> things compared."--<i>Octavo Gram.</i>, i, 167. What then of the following example: "Which of <i>those two persons</i> has <i>most</i> distinguished himself?"--<i>Ib., Key</i>, ii, 187. Again, in treating of the adjectives <i>this</i> and <i>that</i>, the same hand writes thus: "<i>This</i> refers to the <i>nearest</i> person or thing, and <i>that</i> to the <i>most distant</i>: as, '<i>This</i> man is <i>more intelligent</i> than <i>that</i>.' <i>This</i> indicates the <i>latter</i>, or <i>last</i> mentioned; <i>that</i>, the <i>former</i>, or <i>first</i> mentioned: as, 'Both wealth and poverty are temptations; <i>that</i> tends to excite pride, <i>this</i>, discontent.'"--<i>Murray's Gram.</i>, i, 56. In the former part of this example, the superlative is twice applied where only two things are spoken of; and, in the latter, it is twice made equivalent to the comparative, with a like reference. The following example shows the same equivalence: "<i>This</i> refers to the <i>last</i> mentioned or <i>nearer</i> thing, <i>that</i> to the <i>first</i> mentioned or <i>more</i> distant thing."--<i>Webber's Gram.</i>, p. 31. So Churchill: "The superlative should not be used, when only two persons or things are compared."--<i>New Gram.</i>, p. 80. "In the <i>first</i> of these two sentences."--<i>Ib.</i>, p. 162; <i>Lowth</i>, p. 120. According to the rule, it should have been, "In the <i>former</i> of these two sentences;" but this would be here ambiguous, because <i>former</i> might mean <i>maker</i>. "When our sentence consists of two members, the <i>longest</i> should, generally, be the concluding one."--<i>Blair's Rhet.</i>, p. 117: and <i>Jamieson's</i>, p. 99. "The <i>shortest</i> member being placed <i>first</i>, we carry it <i>more readily</i> in our memory as we proceed to the second."--<i>Ib.</i>, &amp; <i>Ib.</i> "Pray consider us, in this respect, as the <i>weakest</i> sex."--<i>Spect.</i>, No. 533. In this last sentence, the comparative, <i>weaker</i>, would perhaps have been better; because, not an absolute, but merely a comparative weakness is meant. So Latham and Child: "It is better, in speaking of only two objects, to use the comparative degree rather than the superlative, even, where we use the article <i>the</i>. <i>This is the better of the two</i>, is preferable to <i>this is</i> the best of the two<i>."--</i>Elementary Gram.<i>, p. 155. Such is their rule; but</i> very soon they forget it, and write thus: "In this case the relative refers to the <i>last</i> of the two."--<i>Ib.</i>, p. 163.</p>
<p>OBS. 14.--Hyperboles are very commonly expressed by comparatives or superlatives; as, "My <i>little finger</i> shall be <i>thicker</i> than my <i>father's</i> loins<i>."--</i>1 Kings<i>, xii, 10. "Unto me, who am</i> less than the least <i>of all</i> saints, is this grace given."--<i>Ephesians</i>, iii, 8. Sometimes, in thus heightening or lowering the object of his conception, the writer falls into a catachresis, solecism, or abuse of the grammatical degrees; as, "Mustard-seed--which is <i>less than all the seeds</i> that be in the earth."--<i>Mark</i>, iv, 31. This expression is objectionable, because mustard-seed is a seed, and cannot be less than itself; though that which is here spoken of, may perhaps have been "<i>the least of all seeds</i>:" and it is the same Greek phrase, that is thus rendered in Matt, xiii, 32. Murray has inserted in his Exercises, among "unintelligible and inconsistent words and phrases," the following example from Milton:</p>
<pre>  "And, in the lowest deep, a lower deep
   Still threat'ning to devour me, opens wide."--<i>Exercises</i>, p. 122.
</pre>
<p>For this supposed inconsistency, ho proposes in his Key the following amendment:</p>
<pre>  "And, in the <i>lower</i> deep, <i>another</i> deep
   Still threat'ning to devour me, opens wide."--<i>Key</i>, p. 254.
</pre>
<p>But, in an other part of his book, he copies from Dr. Blair the same passage, with commendation: saying, "The following sentiments of <i>Satan in</i> Milton<i>, as strongly as they are described,</i> contain nothing <i>but what is</i> <i>natural and proper</i>:</p>
<pre>   'Me miserable! which way shall I fly
   Infinite wrath, and infinite despair?
   Which way I fly is Hell; myself am Hell;
   And in the lowest <i>depth</i>, a lower deep,
   Still threat'ning to devour me, opens wide,
   To which the Hell I suffer seems a Heaven.' <i>P. Lost</i>, B. iv, l. 73."
        <i>Blair's Lectures</i>, p. 153; <i>Murray's Grammar</i>, p. 352.
</pre>
<p>OBS. 15.--Milton's word, in the fourth line above, is <i>deep</i>, and not <i>depth</i>, as these authors here give it: nor was it very polite in them, to use a phraseology which comes so near to saying, the devil was in the poet. Alas for grammar! accuracy in its teachers has become the most rare of all qualifications. As for Murray's correction above, I see not how it can please any one who chooses to think Hell a place of great depth. A descent into his "<i>lower</i> deep" and "<i>other</i> deep," might be a plunge less horrible than two or three successive slides in one of our western caverns! But Milton supposes the arch-fiend might descend to the lowest <i>imaginable</i> depth of Hell, and there be liable to a still further fall of more tremendous extent. Fall whither? Into the horrid and inconceivable profundity of the <i>bottomless pit</i>! What signifies it, to object to his language as "<i>unintelligible</i>" if it conveys his idea better than any other could? In no human conception of what is infinite, can there be any real exaggeration. To amplify beyond the truth, is here impossible. Nor is there any superlation which can fix a limit to the idea of more and more in infinitude. Whatever literal absurdity there may be in it, the duplication seems greatly to augment what was even our greatest conception of the thing. Homer, with a like figure, though expressed in the positive degree, makes Jupiter threaten any rebel god, that he shall be thrown down from Olympus, to suffer the burning pains of the Tartarean gulf; not in the centre, but,</p>
<pre>  "As <i>deep</i> beneath th' infernal centre hurl'd,
   As from that centre to th' ethereal world."
       --<i>Pope's Iliad</i>, B. viii, l. 19.
</pre>
<p><br>
REGULAR COMPARISON.</p>
<p>Adjectives are regularly compared, when the comparative degree is expressed by adding <i>er</i>, and the superlative, by adding <i>est</i> to them: as, Pos., <i>great</i>, Comp., <i>greater</i>, Superl., <i>greatest</i>; Pos., <i>mild</i>, Comp., <i>milder</i>, Superl., <i>mildest</i>.</p>
<p>In the variation of adjectives, final consonants are doubled, final <i>e</i> is omitted, and final <i>y</i> is changed to <i>i</i>, agreeably to the rules for spelling: as, <i>hot, hotter, hottest; wide, wider, widest; happy, happier,</i> happiest<i>.</i></p>
<p>The regular method of comparison belongs almost exclusively to monosyllables, with dissyllables ending in <i>w</i> or <i>y</i>, and such others as receive it and still have but one syllable after the accent: as, <i>fierce,</i> fiercer, fiercest; narrow, narrower, narrowest; gloomy, gloomier, gloomiest; serene, serener, serenest; noble, nobler, noblest; gentle, gentler, gentlest<i>.</i></p>
<p><br>
COMPARISON BY ADVERBS.</p>
<p>The two degrees of superiority may also be expressed with precisely the same import as above, by prefixing to the adjective the adverbs <i>more</i> and <i>most</i>: as, <i>wise, more wise, most wise; famous, more famous, most famous;</i> amiable, more amiable, most amiable<i>.</i></p>
<p>The degrees of inferiority are expressed, in like manner, by the adverbs <i>less</i> and <i>least</i>: as, <i>wise, less wise, least wise; famous, less famous,</i> least famous; amiable, less amiable, least amiable<i>. The regular method of</i> comparison has, properly speaking, no degrees of this kind.</p>
<p>Nearly all adjectives that admit of different degrees, may be compared by means of the adverbs; but, for short words, the regular method is generally preferable: as, <i>quick, quicker, quickest</i>; rather than, <i>quick, more</i> quick, most quick<i>.</i></p>
<p><br>
OBSERVATIONS.</p>
<p>OBS. 1.--The genius of our language is particularly averse to the lengthening of long words by additional syllables; and, in the comparison of adjectives, <i>er</i> and <i>est</i> always add a syllable to the word, except it end in <i>le</i> after a mute. Thus, <i>free, freer, freest</i>, increases syllabically; but <i>ample, ampler, amplest</i>, does not. Whether any particular adjective admits of comparison or not, is a matter of reasoning from the sense of the term; by which method it shall be compared, is in some degree a matter of taste; though custom has decided that long words shall not be inflected, and for the shorter, there is generally an obvious bias in favour of one form rather than the other. Dr. Johnson says, "The comparison of adjectives is very uncertain; and being much regulated by commodiousness of utterance, or agreeableness of sound, is not easily reduced to rules. Monosyllables are commonly compared. Polysyllables, or words of more than two syllables, are seldom compared otherwise than by <i>more</i> and <i>most</i>. Dissyllables are seldom compared if they terminate in <i>full, less, ing, ous, ed, id, at, ent, ain, or ive</i>."--<i>Gram. of the</i> English Tongue<i>, p. 6. "When the positive contains but one syllable, the</i> degrees are usually formed by adding <i>er</i> or <i>est</i>. When the positive contains two syllables, it is matter of taste which method you shall use in forming the degrees. The ear is, in this case, the best guide. But, when the positive contains more than two syllables, the degrees must be formed by the use of <i>more</i> and <i>most</i>. We may say, <i>tenderer</i> and <i>tenderest,</i> pleasanter <i>and</i> pleasantest, prettier <i>and</i> prettiest<i>; but who could</i> endure <i>delicater</i> and <i>delicatest</i>?"--<i>Cobbett's E. Gram.</i>, p. 81. <i>Quiet,</i> bitter, clever, sober<i>, and perhaps some others like them, are still</i> regularly compared; but such words as <i>secretest, famousest, virtuousest,</i> powerfullest<i>, which were used by Milton, have gone out of fashion. The</i> following, though not very commonly used, are perhaps allowable. "Yet these are the two <i>commonest</i> occupations of mankind."--<i>Philological Museum</i>, i, 431. "Their <i>pleasantest</i> walks throughout life must be guarded by armed men."--<i>Ib.</i>, i, 437. "Franklin possessed the rare talent of drawing useful lessons from the <i>commonest</i> occurrences."--<i>Murray's Sequel</i>, p. 323. "Unbidden guests are often <i>welcomest</i> when they are gone."--SHAK.: <i>in</i> Joh. Dict.</p>
<pre>  "There was a lad, th' <i>unluckiest</i> of his crew,
   Was still contriving something bad, but new."--KING: <i>ib.</i>
</pre>
<p>OBS. 2.--I make a distinction between the regular comparison by <i>er</i> and <i>est</i>, and the comparison by adverbs; because, in a grammatical point of view, these two methods are totally different: the meaning, though the same, being expressed in the one case, by an inflection of the adjective; and in the other, by a phrase consisting of two different parts of speech. If the placing of an adverb before an adjective is to be called a grammatical modification or variation of the latter word, we shall have many other degrees than those which are enumerated above. The words may with much more propriety be parsed separately, the degree being ascribed to the adverb--or, if you please, to both words, for both are varied in sense by the inflection of the former. The degrees in which qualities may exist in nature, are infinitely various; but the only degrees with which the grammarian is concerned, are those which our variation of the adjective or adverb enables us to express--including, as of course we must, the state or sense of the primitive word, as one. The reasoning which would make the positive degree to be no degree, would also make the nominative case, or the <i>casus rectus</i> of the Latins, to be no case.</p>
<p>OBS. 3.--Whenever the adjective itself denotes these degrees, and is duly varied in form to express them, they properly belong to it; as, <i>worthy,</i> worthier, worthiest<i>. (Though no apology can be made for the frequent error</i> of confounding the <i>degree of a quality</i>, with the <i>verbal sign</i> which expresses it.) If an adverb is employed for this purpose, that also is compared, and the two degrees thus formed or expressed, are properly its own; as, worthy, <i>more</i> worthy, <i>most</i> worthy. But these same degrees may be yet otherwise expressed; as, worthy, <i>in a higher degree</i> worthy, <i>in</i> the highest degree <i>worthy. Here also the adjective</i> worthy <i>is virtually</i> compared, as before; but only the adjective <i>high</i> is grammatically modified. Again, we may form three degrees with several adverbs to each, thus: Pos., <i>very truly</i> worthy; Comp., <i>much more truly</i> worthy; Sup., <i>much the most truly</i> worthy. There are also other adverbs, which, though not varied in themselves like <i>much, more, most</i>, may nevertheless have nearly the same effect upon the adjective; as, worthy, <i>comparatively</i> worthy, <i>superlatively</i> worthy. I make these remarks, because many grammarians have erroneously parsed the adverbs <i>more</i> and <i>most, less</i> and <i>least</i>, as parts of the adjective.</p>
<p>OBS. 4.--Harris, in his Hermes, or Philosophical Inquiry concerning Universal Grammar, has very unceremoniously pronounced the doctrine of three degrees of comparison, to be <i>absurd</i>; and the author of the British Grammar, as he emotes the whole passage without offering any defence of that doctrine, seems to second the allegation. "Mr. Harris observes, that, 'There cannot well be more than two degrees; one to denote simple excess, and one to denote superlative. Were we indeed to introduce more degrees, we ought perhaps to introduce infinite, which is absurd. For why stop at a limited number, when in all subjects, susceptible of intension, the intermediate excesses are in a manner infinite? There are infinite degrees of <i>more white</i> between the first simple <i>white</i> and the superlative <i>whitest</i>; the same may be said of <i>more great, more strong, more minute</i>, &amp;c. The doctrine of grammarians about <i>three</i> such degrees, which they call the Positive, the Comparative, and the Superlative, must needs be absurd; both because in their Positive there is no comparison at all, and because their Superlative is a Comparative as much as their Comparative itself.' <i>Hermes</i>, p. 197."--<i>Brit. Gram.</i>, p. 98. This objection is rashly urged. No comparison can be imagined without bringing together as many as two terms, and if the positive is one of these, it is a degree of comparison; though neither this nor the superlative is, for that reason, "<i>a</i> Comparative<i>." Why we stop at three degrees, I have already shown: we have</i> three <i>forms</i>, and only three.</p>
<p>OBS. 5.--"The termination <i>ish</i> may be accounted in some sort a degree of comparison, by which the signification is diminished below the positive, as <i>black, blackish</i>, or tending to blackness; <i>salt, saltish</i>, or having a little taste of salt:[179] they therefore admit of no comparison. This termination is seldom added but to words expressing sensible qualities, nor often to words of above one syllable, and is scarcely used in the solemn or sublime style."--<i>Dr. Johnson's Gram.</i> "The <i>first</i> [degree] denotes a slight degree of the quality, and is expressed by the termination <i>ish</i>; as, <i>reddish, brownish, yellowish</i>. This may be denominated the <i>imperfect</i> degree of the attribute."--<i>Dr. Webster's Improved Gram.</i>, p. 47. I doubt the correctness of the view taken above by Johnson, and dissent entirely from Webster, about his "<i>first degree</i> of comparison." Of adjectives in <i>ish</i> we have perhaps a hundred; but nine out of ten of them are derived clearly from <i>nouns</i>, as, <i>boyish, girlish</i>; and who can prove that <i>blackish, saltish, reddish, brownish</i>, and <i>yellowish</i>, are not also from the <i>nouns, black, salt, red, brown</i>, and <i>yellow</i>? or that "a <i>more</i> reddish <i>tinge,"--"a</i> more saltish <i>taste," are not correct phrases? There</i> is, I am persuaded, no good reason for noticing this termination as constituting a degree of comparison. All "double comparisons" are said to be ungrammatical; but, if <i>ish</i> forms a degree, it is such a degree as may be compared again: as,</p>
<pre>  "And seem <i>more learnedish</i> than those
   That at a greater charge compose."--<i>Butler</i>.
</pre>
<p>OBS. 6.--Among the degrees of comparison, some have enumerated that of <i>equality</i>; as when we say, "It is <i>as sweet as</i> honey." Here is indeed a comparison, but it is altogether in the <i>positive</i> degree, and needs no other name. This again refutes Harris; who says, that in the positive there is no comparison at all. But further: it is plain, that in this degree there may be comparisons of <i>inequality</i> also; as, "Molasses is <i>not so</i> sweet <i>as honey."--"Civility is</i> not so slight <i>a matter as it is commonly</i> thought."--<i>Art of Thinking</i>, p. 92. Nay, such comparisons may equal any superlative. Thus it is said, I think, in the Life of Robert Hall: "Probably no human being ever before suffered <i>so much</i> bodily pain." What a preëminence is here! and yet the form of the adjective is only that of the positive degree. "Nothing <i>so uncertain</i> as general reputation."--<i>Art</i> of Thinking<i>, p. 50. "Nothing</i> so nauseous <i>as undistinguishing</i> civility."--<i>Ib.</i>, p. 88. These, likewise, would be strong expressions, if they were correct English. But, to my apprehension, every such comparison of equality involves a solecism, when, as it here happens, the former term includes the latter. The word <i>nothing</i> is a general negative, and <i>reputation</i> is a particular affirmative. The comparison of equality between them, is therefore certainly improper: because <i>nothing</i> cannot be equal to <i>something</i>; and, reputation being something, and of course equal to itself, the proposition is evidently untrue. It ought to be, "Nothing <i>is more uncertain than</i> general reputation." This is the same as to say, "General reputation is <i>as uncertain as any thing</i> that can be named." Or else the former term should exempt the latter; as. "<i>Nothing else</i>"--or, "No <i>other</i> thing, is <i>so uncertain</i> as" <i>this popular honour, public</i> esteem<i>, or "</i>general reputation<i>." And so of all similar examples.</i></p>
<p>OBS. 7.--In all comparisons, care must be taken to adapt the terms to the degree which is expressed by the adjective or adverb. The superlative degree requires that the object to which it relates, be one of those with which it is compared; as, "<i>Eve</i> was <i>the fairest</i> of women." The comparative degree, on the contrary, requires that the object spoken of be not included among those with which it is compared; as, "<i>Eve</i> was <i>fairer</i> than any of <i>her daughters</i>." To take the inclusive term here, and say, "<i>Eve</i> was <i>fairer</i> than any <i>woman</i>," would be no less absurd, than Milton's assertion, that "Eve was <i>the fairest</i> of <i>her daughters</i>:" the former supposes that she was <i>not a woman</i>; the latter, that she was <i>one</i> of her own daughters<i>. But Milton's solecism is double; he makes Adam</i> one of his own sons<i>:--</i></p>
<pre>  "Adam the goodliest man of men since born
   His sons, the fairest of her daughters Eve."--<i>P. Lost</i>, B. iv, l. 324.
</pre>
<p>OBS. 8.--"Such adjectives," says Churchill, "as have in themselves a superlative signification, or express qualities not susceptible of degrees, do not properly admit either the comparative or [the] superlative form. Under this rule may be included <i>all adjectives with a negative</i> prefix<i>."--</i>New Gram.<i>, p. 80. Again: "As</i> immediate <i>signifies instant,</i> present with regard to time, Prior should not have written '<i>more</i> immediate.' <i>Dr. Johnson</i>."--<i>Ib.</i>, p. 233. "Hooker has <i>unaptest</i>; Locke, <i>more uncorrupted</i>; Holder, <i>more undeceivable</i>: for these the proper expressions would have been the opposite signs without the negation: <i>least</i> apt, less corrupted, less deceivable<i>. Watts speaks of 'a</i> most unpassable barrier.' If he had simply said 'an unpassable barrier,' we should have understood it at once in the strongest sense, as a barrier impossible to be surmounted: but, by attempting to express something more, he gives an idea of something less; we perceive, that his <i>unpassable</i> means <i>difficult to</i> pass<i>. This is the mischief of the propensity to exaggeration; which,</i> striving after strength, sinks into weakness."--<i>Ib.</i>, p. 234.</p>
<p>OBS. 9.--The foregoing remarks from Churchill appear <i>in general</i> to have been dictated by good sense; but, if his own practice is right, there must be some exceptions to his rule respecting the comparison of adjectives with a negative prefix; for, in the phrase "<i>less imprudent</i>," which, according to a passage quoted before, he will have to be different from "<i>more</i> prudent<i>," he himself furnishes an example of such comparison. In fact,</i> very many words of that class are compared by good writers: as, "Nothing is <i>more unnecessary</i>."--<i>Lowth's Gram., Pref.</i>, p. v. "What is yet <i>more</i> unaccountable<i>."--ROGERS:</i> in Joh. Dict. <i>"It is hard to determine which is</i> <i>most uneligible</i>."--<i>Id., ib.</i> "Where it appears the <i>most unbecoming</i> and <i>unnatural</i>."--ADDISON: <i>ib.</i> "Men of the best sense and of the <i>most</i> unblemished <i>lives."--</i>Id., ib. <i>"March and September are the</i> most unsettled <i>and</i> unequable <i>of seasons."--BENTLEY:</i> ib. <i>"Barcelona was</i> taken by a <i>most unexpected</i> accident."--SWIFT: <i>ib.</i> "The <i>most barren</i> and <i>unpleasant</i>."--WOODWARD: <i>ib.</i> "O good, but <i>most unwise</i> patricians!"--SHAK.: <i>ib.</i> "<i>More unconstant</i> than the wind."--<i>Id., ib.</i> "We may say <i>more</i> or <i>less imperfect</i>."--<i>Murray's Gram.</i>, p. 168. "Some of those [passions] which act with the <i>most irresistible</i> energy upon the hearts of mankind, are altogether omitted in the catalogue of Aristotle."--<i>Adams's Rhet.</i>, i, 380. "The wrong of him who presumes to talk of owning me, is <i>too unmeasured</i> to be softened by kindness."--<i>Channing, on Emancipation</i>, p. 52. "Which, we are sensible, are <i>more inconclusive</i> than the rest."--<i>Blair's Rhet.</i>, p. 319.</p>
<pre>  "Ere yet the salt of <i>most unrighteous</i> tears
   Had left the flushing in her galled eyes."--<i>Shak.</i>
</pre>
<p>OBS. 10.--Comparison must not be considered a general property of adjectives. It belongs chiefly to the class which I call common adjectives, and is by no means applicable to all of these. <i>Common adjectives</i>, or epithets denoting quality, are perhaps more numerous than all the other classes put together. Many of these, and a few that are pronominal, may be varied by comparison; and some <i>participial</i> adjectives may be compared by means of the adverbs. But adjectives formed from <i>proper names</i>, all the numerals, and most of the compounds, are in no way susceptible of comparison. All nouns used adjectively, as an <i>iron</i> bar, an <i>evening</i> school, a <i>mahogany</i> chair, a <i>South-Sea</i> dream, are also incapable of comparison. In the title of "His <i>Most Christian</i> Majesty," the superlative adverb is applied to a <i>proper adjective</i>; but who will pretend that we ought to understand by it "<i>the highest degree</i>" of Christian attainment? It might seem uncourtly to suggest that this is "an abuse of the king's English," I shall therefore say no such thing. Pope compares the word Christian, in the following couplet:--</p>
<pre>  "Go, purified by flames ascend the sky,
   My better and <i>more Christian</i> progeny."--<i>Dunciad</i>, B. i, l. 227.

IRREGULAR COMPARISON.</p>
<p>The following adjectives are compared irregularly: <i>good, better, best;</i> bad, evil<i>, or</i> ill, worse, worst; little, less, least; much, more, most; many, more, most<i>.</i></p>
<p>OBSERVATIONS.</p>
<p>OBS. 1.--In <i>English</i>, and also in <i>Latin</i>, most adjectives that denote <i>place</i> or <i>situation</i>, not only form the superlative irregularly, but are also either defective or redundant in comparison. Thus:</p>
<p>I. The following nine have more than one superlative: <i>far, farther,</i> farthest, farmost<i>, or</i> farthermost; near, nearer, nearest <i>or</i> next; fore, former, foremost <i>or</i> first; hind, hinder, hindmost <i>or</i> hindermost; in, inner, inmost <i>or</i> innermost; out, outer<i>, or</i> utter, outmost <i>or</i> utmost, outermost <i>or</i> uttermost; up, upper, upmost <i>or</i> uppermost; low, lower, lowest <i>or</i> lowermost; late, later <i>or</i> latter, latest <i>or</i> last<i>.</i></p>
<p>II. The following five want the positive: [<i>aft</i>, adv.,] <i>after, aftmost</i> or <i>aftermost</i>; [<i>forth</i>, adv., formerly <i>furth</i>,[180]] <i>further, furthest</i> or <i>furthermost; hither, hithermost; nether, nethermost; under, undermost</i>.</p>
<p>III. The following want the comparative: <i>front, frontmost; rear, rearmost;</i> head, headmost; end, endmost; top, topmost; bottom, bottommost; mid <i>or</i> <i>middle, midst,[181] midmost</i> or <i>middlemost; north, northmost; south,</i> southmost; east, eastmost; west, westmost; northern, northernmost; southern, southernmost; eastern, easternmost; western, westernmost<i>.</i></p>
<p>OBS. 2.--Many of these irregular words are not always used as adjectives, but oftener as nouns, adverbs, or prepositions. The sense in which they are employed, will show to what class they belong. The terms <i>fore</i> and <i>hind,</i> front <i>and</i> rear, right <i>and</i> left, in <i>and</i> out, high <i>and</i> low, top <i>and</i> <i>bottom, up</i> and <i>down, upper</i> and <i>under, mid</i> and <i>after</i>, all but the last pair, are in direct contrast with each other. Many of them are often joined in composition with other words; and some, when used as adjectives of place, are rarely separated from their nouns: as, <i>in</i>land, <i>out</i>house, <i>mid</i>-sea, <i>after</i>-ages. Practice is here so capricious, I find it difficult to determine whether the compounding of these terms is proper or not. It is a case about which he that inquires most, may perhaps be most in doubt. If the joining of the words prevents the possibility of mistaking the adjective for a preposition, it prevents also the separate classification of the adjective and the noun, and thus in some sense destroys the former by making the whole a noun. Dr. Webster writes thus: "FRONTROOM, <i>n.</i> A room or apartment in the <i>forepart</i> of a house. BACKROOM, <i>n.</i> A room behind the <i>front room</i>, or in the <i>back part</i> of the house."--<i>Octavo Dict.</i> So of many phrases by which people tell of turning things, or changing the position of their parts; as, <i>in</i>side out, <i>out</i>side <i>in; up</i>side <i>down, down</i>side <i>up</i>; <i>wrong</i> end <i>foremost,</i> but<i>-end</i> foremost<i>;</i> fore<i>-part</i> back, fore<i>-end</i> aft<i>;</i> hind <i>side</i> <i>before, back</i>side <i>before</i>. Here all these contrasted particles seem to be adjectives of place or situation. What grammarians in general would choose to call them, it is hard to say; probably, many would satisfy themselves with calling the whole "<i>an adverbial phrase</i>,"--the common way of disposing of every thing which it is difficult to analyze. These, and the following examples from Scott, are a fair specimen of the uncertainty of present usage:</p>
<pre>  "The herds without a keeper strayed,
   The plough was in <i>mid-furrow</i> staid."--<i>Lady of the Lake</i>.
</pre>
<pre>   "The eager huntsman knew his bound,
   And in <i>mid chase</i> called off his hound."--<i>Ibidem</i>.
</pre>
<p>OBS. 3.--For the chief points of the compass, we have so many adjectives, and so many modes of varying or comparing them, that it is difficult to tell their number, or to know which to choose in practice. (1.) <i>North,</i> south, east<i>, and</i> west<i>, are familiarly used both as nouns and as</i> adjectives. From these it seems not improper to form superlatives, as above, by adding <i>most</i>; as, "From Aroar to Nebo, and the wild of <i>southmost</i> Abarim."--<i>Milton</i>. "There are no rivulets or springs in the island of Feror, the <i>westmost</i> of the Canaries."--<i>White's Nat. Hist.</i> (2.) These primitive terms may also be compared, in all three of the degrees, by the adverbs <i>farther</i> and <i>farthest</i>, or <i>further</i> and <i>furthest</i>; as, "Which is yet <i>farther west</i>."--<i>Bacon</i>. (3.) Though we never employ as separate words the comparatives <i>norther, souther, easter,</i> wester<i>, we have</i> northerly, southerly, easterly<i>, and</i> westerly<i>, which</i> seem to have been formed from such comparatives, by adding <i>ly</i>; and these four may be compared by the adverbs <i>more</i> and <i>most</i>, or <i>less</i> and <i>least</i>: as, "These hills give us a view of the <i>most easterly, southerly</i>, and <i>westerly</i> parts of England."--GRAUNT: <i>in Joh. Dict.</i> (4.) From these supposed comparatives likewise, some authors form the superlatives <i>northermost, southermost, eastermost</i>, and <i>westermost</i>; as, "From the <i>westermost</i> part of Oyster bay."--<i>Dr. Webster's Hist. U. S.</i>, p. 126. "And three miles southward of the <i>southermost</i> part of said bay."--<i>Trumbull's Hist. of Amer.</i>, Vol. i, p. 88. "Pockanocket was on the <i>westermost</i> line of Plymouth Colony."--<i>Ib.</i>, p. 44. "As far as the <i>northermost</i> branch of the said bay or river."--<i>Ib.</i>, p. 127. The propriety of these is at least questionable; and, as they are neither very necessary to the language, nor recognized by any of our lexicographers, I forbear to approve them. (5.) From the four primitives we have also a third series of positives, ending in <i>ern</i>; as, <i>northern, southern, eastern,</i> western<i>. These, though they have no comparatives of their own, not only</i> form superlatives by assuming the termination <i>most</i>, but are sometimes compared, perhaps in both degrees, by a separate use of the adverbs: as, "<i>Southernmost, a</i>. Furthest towards the south."--<i>Webster's Dict.</i> "Until it shall intersect the <i>northernmost</i> part of the thirty-first degree of north latitude."--<i>Articles of Peace</i>. "To the <i>north-westernmost</i> head of Connecticut river."--<i>Ib.</i> "Thence through the said lake to the <i>most</i> north-western <i>point thereof."--</i>Ib.</p>
<p>OBS. 4.--It may be remarked of the comparatives <i>former</i> and <i>latter</i> or <i>hinder, upper</i> and <i>under</i> or <i>nether, inner</i> and <i>outer</i> or <i>utter,</i> after <i>and</i> hither<i>; as well as of the Latin</i> superior <i>and</i> inferior, anterior <i>and</i> posterior, interior <i>and</i> exterior, prior <i>and</i> ulterior, senior <i>and</i> junior, major <i>and</i> minor<i>; that they cannot, like other</i> comparatives, be construed with the conjunction <i>than</i>. After all genuine English comparatives, this conjunction may occur, because it is the only fit word for introducing the latter term of comparison; but we never say one thing is <i>former</i> or <i>latter, superior</i> or <i>inferior, than</i> an other. And so of all the rest here named. Again, no real comparative or superlative can ever need an other superadded to it; but <i>inferior</i> and <i>superior</i> convey ideas that do not always preclude the additional conception of <i>more</i> or <i>less</i>: as, "With respect to high and low notes, pronunciation is still <i>more inferior</i> to singing."--<i>Kames, Elements of</i> Criticism<i>, Vol. ii, p. 73. "The mistakes which the</i> most superior understanding is apt to fall into."--<i>West's Letters to a Young Lady</i>, p. 117.</p>
<p>OBS. 5.--Double comparatives and double superlatives, being in general awkward and unfashionable, as well as tautological, ought to be avoided. Examples: "The Duke of Milan, and his <i>more braver</i> daughter, could control thee."--<i>Shak., Tempest</i>. Say, "his <i>more gallant</i> daughter." "What in me was purchased, falls upon thee in a <i>more fairer</i> sort."--<i>Id., Henry IV</i>. Say, "<i>fairer</i>," or, "<i>more honest</i>;" for "<i>purchased</i>" here means <i>stolen</i>. "Changed to a <i>worser</i> shape thou canst not be."--<i>Id., Hen. VI</i>. Say, "a <i>worse</i> shape"--or, "an <i>uglier</i> shape." "After the <i>most</i> straitest <i>sect of our religion, I lived a Pharisee."--</i>Acts<i>, xxvi, 5.</i> Say, "the <i>strictest</i> sect." "Some say he's mad; others, that <i>lesser</i> hate him, do call it valiant fury."--<i>Shak</i>. Say, "others, that hate him <i>less</i>." In this last example, <i>lesser</i> is used adverbially; in which construction it is certainly incorrect. But against <i>lesser</i> as an adjective, some grammarians have spoken with more severity, than comports with a proper respect for authority. Dr. Johnson says, "LESSER, <i>adj</i>. A barbarous corruption of <i>less</i>, formed by the vulgar from the habit of terminating comparatives in <i>er; afterward adopted by poets, and then by</i> writers of prose, till it has all the authority which a mode originally erroneous can derive from custom<i>."--</i>Quarto Dict. <i>With no great fairness,</i> Churchill quotes this passage as far as the semicolon, and there stops. The position thus taken, he further endeavours to strengthen, by saying, "<i>Worser</i>, though <i>not more barbarous</i>, offends the ear in a much greater degree, because it has not been so frequently used."--<i>New Gram.</i>, p. 232. Example: "And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the <i>lesser</i> light to rule the night."--<i>Gen.</i>, i, 16. Kirkham, after making an <i>imitation</i> of this passage, remarks upon it: "<i>Lesser</i> is <i>as</i> incorrect <i>as</i> badder, gooder, worser<i>."--</i>Gram.<i>, p. 77. The judgement of</i> any critic who is ignorant enough to say this, is worthy only of contempt. <i>Lesser</i> is still frequently used by the most tasteful authors, both in verse and prose: as, "It is the glowing style of a man who is negligent of <i>lesser</i> graces."--<i>Blair's Rhet.</i>, p. 189.</p>
<pre>  "Athos, Olympus, Ætna, Atlas, made
   These hills seem things of <i>lesser</i> dignity."--<i>Byron</i>.
</pre>
<p>OBS. 6.--The adjective <i>little</i> is used in different senses; for it contrasts sometimes with <i>great</i>, and sometimes with <i>much</i>. <i>Lesser</i> appears to refer only to size. Hence <i>less</i> and <i>lesser</i> are not always equivalent terms. <i>Lesser</i> means <i>smaller</i>, and contrasts only with <i>greater</i>. <i>Less</i> contrasts sometimes with <i>greater</i>, but oftener with <i>more</i>, the comparative of <i>much</i>; for, though it may mean <i>not so large</i>, its most common meaning is <i>not so much</i>. It ought to be observed, likewise, that <i>less</i> is not an adjective of <i>number</i>,[182] though not unfrequently used as such. It does not mean <i>fewer</i>, and is therefore not properly employed in sentences like the following: "In all verbs, there are no <i>less</i> than three things implied at once."--<i>Blair's Rhet.</i>, p. 81. "<i>Smaller</i> things than three," is nonsense; and so, in reality, is what the Doctor here says. <i>Less</i> is not the proper opposite to <i>more</i>, when <i>more</i> is the comparative of <i>many: few, fewer, fewest</i>, are the only words which contrast regularly with <i>many, more, most</i>. In the following text, these comparatives are rightly employed: "And to the <i>more</i> ye shall give the <i>more</i> inheritance, and to the <i>fewer</i> ye shall give the <i>less</i> inheritance."--<i>Numbers</i>, xxxiii, 54. But if writers will continue to use <i>less</i> for <i>fewer</i>, so that "<i>less cattle</i>," for instance, may mean "<i>fewer</i> cattle<i>;" we shall be under a sort of</i> necessity <i>to retain</i> lesser<i>, in</i> order to speak intelligibly: as, "It shall be for the sending-forth of oxen, and for the treading of <i>lesser</i> cattle."--<i>Isaiah</i>, vii, 25. I have no partiality for the word <i>lesser</i>, neither will I make myself ridiculous by flouting at its rudeness. "This word," says Webster, "is a corruption, but [it is] too well established to be discarded. Authors always write the <i>Lesser</i> Asia."--<i>Octavo Dict.</i> "By the same reason, may a man punish the <i>lesser</i> breaches of that law."--<i>Locke</i>. "When we speak of the <i>lesser</i> differences among the tastes of men."--<i>Blair's Rhet.</i>, p. 20. "In greater or <i>lesser</i> degrees of complexity."--<i>Burke, on Sublime</i>, p. 94. "The greater ought not to succumb to the <i>lesser</i>."--<i>Dillwyn's Reflections</i>, p. 128. "To such productions, <i>lesser</i> composers must resort for ideas."--<i>Gardiner's Music of Nature</i>, p. 413.</p>
<pre>  "The larger here, and there the <i>lesser</i> lambs,
   The new-fall'n young herd bleating for their dams."--<i>Pope</i>.
</pre>
<p>OBS. 7.--Our grammarians deny the comparison of many adjectives, from a false notion that they are already superlatives. Thus W. Allen: "Adjectives compounded with the Latin preposition <i>per</i>, are already superlative: as, <i>perfect, perennial, permanent</i>, &amp;c."--<i>Elements of E. Gram.</i>, p. 52. In reply to this, I would say, that nothing is really superlative, in English, but what has the form and construction of the superlative; as, "The <i>most</i> permanent <i>of all dyes." No word beginning with</i> per<i>, is superlative by</i> virtue of this Latin prefix. "Separate spirits, which are beings that have <i>perfecter</i> knowledge and greater happiness than we, must needs have also a <i>perfecter</i> way of communicating their thoughts than we have."--<i>Locke's</i> Essay<i>, B. ii, Ch. 24, §36, This mode of comparison is not now good, but it</i> shows that <i>perfect</i> is no superlative. Thus Kirkham: "The <i>following</i> adjectives, and <i>many others</i>, are <i>always in the superlative degree</i>; because, by expressing a quality <i>in the highest degree</i>, they carry in themselves a superlative signification: <i>chief, extreme, perfect, right,</i> wrong, honest, just, true, correct, sincere, vast, immense, ceaseless, infinite, endless, unparalleled, universal, supreme, unlimited, omnipotent, all-wise, eternal<i>." [183]--</i>Gram.<i>, p. 73. So the Rev. David Blair: "The</i> words <i>perfect, certain, infinite, universal, chief, supreme, right, true,</i> extreme, superior<i>, and some others, which express a perfect and</i> superlative sense in themselves, do not admit of comparison."--<i>English</i> Gram.<i>, p. 81. Now, according to Murray's definition, which Kirkham adopts,</i> none of these words can be at all in the superlative degree. On the contrary, there are several among them, from which true superlatives are frequently and correctly formed. Where are the positives which are here supposed to be "<i>increased to the highest degree</i>?" Every real superlative in our language, except <i>best</i> and <i>worst, most</i> and <i>least, first</i> and <i>last</i>, with the still more irregular word <i>next</i>, is a derivative, formed from some other English word, by adding <i>est</i> or <i>most</i>; as, <i>truest,</i> hindmost<i>. The propriety or impropriety of comparing the foregoing words,</i> or any of the "<i>many others</i>" of which this author speaks, is to be determined according to their meaning, and according to the usage of good writers, and not by the dictation of a feeble pedant, or upon the supposition that if compared they would form "<i>double superlatives</i>."</p>
<p>OBS. 8.--<i>Chief</i> is from the French word <i>chef</i>, the <i>head: chiefest</i> is therefore no more a double superlative than <i>headmost</i>: "But when the <i>headmost</i> foes appeared."--<i>Scott</i>. Nor are <i>chief</i> and <i>chiefest</i> equivalent terms: "Doeg an Edomite, the <i>chiefest</i> of the herdsmen."--<i>1</i> Samuel<i>, xxi, 7. "The</i> chief <i>of the herdsmen," would convey a different</i> meaning; it would be either the <i>leader</i> of the herdsmen, or the <i>principal</i> part <i>of them.</i> Chiefest<i>, however, has often been used where</i> chief <i>would</i> have been better; as, "He sometimes denied admission to the <i>chiefest</i> officers of the army."--<i>Clarendon</i>, let us look further at Kirkham's list of <i>absolute</i> "<i>superlatives</i>."</p>
<p>OBS. 9.--<i>Extreme</i> is from the Latin superlative <i>extremus</i>, and of course its literal signification is not really susceptible of increase. Yet <i>extremest</i> has been used, and is still used, by some of the very best writers; as, "They thought it the <i>extremest</i> of evils."--<i>Bacon</i>. "That on the sea's <i>extremest</i> border stood."--<i>Addison</i>. "How, to <i>extremest</i> thrill of agony."--<i>Pollok</i>, B. viii, l. 270. "I go th' <i>extremest</i> remedy to prove."--<i>Dryden</i>. "In <i>extremest</i> poverty."--<i>Swift</i>. "The hairy fool stood on th' <i>extremest</i> verge of the swift brook, augmenting it with tears."--<i>Shak</i>. "While the <i>extremest</i> parts of the earth were meditating submission."--<i>Atterbury</i>. "His writings are poetical to the <i>extremest</i> boundaries of poetry."--<i>Adams's Rhetoric</i>, i, 87. In prose, this superlative is not now very common; but the poets still occasionally use it, for the sake of their measure; and it ought to be noticed that the simple adjective is <i>not partitive</i>. If we say, for the first example, "the <i>extreme</i> of evils;" we make the word a <i>noun</i>, and do not convey exactly the same idea that is there expressed.</p>
<p>OBS. 10.--<i>Perfect</i>, if taken in its strictest sense, must not be compared; but this word, like many others which mean most in the positive, is often used with a certain latitude of meaning, which renders its comparison by the adverbs not altogether inadmissible; nor is it destitute of authority, as I have already shown. (See Obs. 8th, p. 280.) "From the first rough sketches, to the <i>more</i> perfect <i>draughts."--</i>Bolingbroke, on Hist.<i>, p. 152. "The</i> most perfect<i>."--</i>Adams's Lect. on Rhet.<i>, i, 99 and 136; ii, 17 and 57:</i> <i>Blair's Lect.</i>, pp. 20 and 399. "The most <i>beautiful and perfect</i> example of analysis."--<i>Lowth's Gram., Pref.</i>, p. 10. "The plainest, <i>most</i> perfect<i>, and most useful manual."--</i>Bullions's E. Gram., Rev.<i>, p. 7. "Our</i> sight is the <i>most perfect</i>, and the most delightful, of all our senses."--<i>Addison, Spect.</i>, No. 411; <i>Blair's Lect.</i>, pp. 115 and 194; <i>Murray's Gram.</i>, i, 322. Here Murray anonymously copied Blair. "And to render natives <i>more perfect</i> in the knowledge of it."--<i>Campbell's Rhet.</i>, p. 171; <i>Murray's Gram.</i>, p. 366. Here Murray copied Campbell, the most accurate of all his masters. Whom did he copy when he said, "The phrases, <i>more perfect</i>, and <i>most perfect</i>, are improper?"--<i>Octavo Gram.</i>, p. 168. But if these are wrong, so is the following sentence: "No poet has ever attained a <i>greater perfection</i> than Horace."--<i>Blair's Lect.</i>, p. 398. And also this: "Why are we brought into the world <i>less perfect</i> in respect to our nature?"--<i>West's Letters to a Young Lady</i>, p. 220.</p>
<p>OBS. 11.--<i>Right</i> and <i>wrong</i> are not often compared by good writers; though we sometimes see such phrases as <i>more right</i> and <i>more wrong</i>, and such words as <i>rightest</i> and <i>wrongest</i>: "'Tis always in the <i>wrongest</i> sense."--<i>Butler</i>. "A method of attaining the <i>rightest</i> and greatest happiness."--PRICE: <i>Priestley's Gram.</i>, p. 78. "It is no <i>more right</i> to steal apples, than it is to steal money."--<i>Webster's New Spelling-Book</i>, p. 118. There are equivalent expressions which seem preferable; as, <i>more</i> proper, more erroneous, most proper, most erroneous<i>.</i></p>
<p>OBS. 12.--<i>Honest, just, true, correct, sincere</i>, and <i>vast</i>, may all be compared at pleasure. Pope's Essay on Criticism is <i>more correct</i> than any thing this modest pretender can write; and in it, he may find the comparative <i>juster</i>, the superlatives <i>justest, truest, sincerest</i>, and the phrases, "<i>So vast</i> a throng,"--"<i>So vast</i> is art:" all of which are contrary to his teaching. "<i>Unjuster</i> dealing is used in buying than in selling."--<i>Butler's Poems</i>, p. 163. "<i>Iniquissimam</i> pacem <i>justissimo</i> bello antefero."--<i>Cicero</i>. "I prefer the <i>unjustest</i> peace before the <i>justest</i> war."--<i>Walker's English Particles</i>, p. 68. The poet Cowley used the word <i>honestest</i>; which is not now very common. So Swift: "What <i>honester</i> folks never durst for their ears."--<i>The Yahoo's Overthrow</i>. So Jucius: "The <i>honestest</i> and ablest men."--<i>Letter XVIII</i>. "The sentence would be <i>more correct</i> in the following form."--<i>Murray's Gram.</i>, i, p. 223. "Elegance is chiefly gained by studying the <i>correctest</i> writers."--<i>Holmes's Rhetoric</i>, p. 27. <i>Honest</i> and <i>correct</i>, for the sake of euphony, require the adverbs; as, <i>more honest</i>, "<i>most</i> correct<i>."--</i>Lowth's Gram., Pref.<i>, p. iv.</i> Vast, vaster, vastest<i>, are</i> words as smooth, as <i>fast, faster, fastest</i>; and <i>more vast</i> is certainly as good English as <i>more just</i>: "Shall mortal man be <i>more just</i> than God?"--<i>Job</i>, iv, 17. "Wilt thou condemn him that is <i>most just</i>?"--<i>Ib.</i>, xxxiv, 17. "More wise, more learn'd, <i>more just</i>, more-everything."--<i>Pope.</i> Universal <i>is often compared by the adverbs, but certainly with no</i> reënforcement of meaning: as, "One of the <i>most universal</i> precepts, is, that the orator himself should feel the passion."--<i>Adams's Rhet.</i>, i, 379. "Though not <i>so universal</i>."--<i>Ib.</i>, ii, 311. "This experience is general, though not <i>so universal</i>, as the absence of memory in childhood."--<i>Ib.</i>, ii, 362. "We can suppose no motive which would <i>more universally</i> operate."--<i>Dr. Blair's Rhet.</i>, p. 55. "Music is known to have been <i>more</i> universally <i>studied."--</i>Ib.<i>, p. 123. "We shall not wonder, that his</i> grammar has been <i>so universally</i> applauded."--<i>Walker's Recommendation in</i> Murray's Gram.<i>, ii, 306. "The pronoun</i> it <i>is the</i> most universal <i>of all</i> the pronouns."--<i>Cutler's Gram.</i>, p. 66. Thus much for one half of this critic's twenty-two "<i>superlatives</i>." The rest are simply adjectives that are not susceptible of comparison: they are not "superlatives" at all. A man might just as well teach, that <i>good</i> is a superlative, and not susceptible of comparison, because "<i>there is none good but one</i>."</p>
<p>OBS. 13.--Pronominal adjectives, when their nouns are expressed, simply relate to them, and have no modifications: except <i>this</i> and <i>that</i>, which form the plurals <i>these</i> and <i>those</i>; and <i>much, many</i>, and a few others, which are compared. Examples: "Whence hath <i>this</i> man <i>this</i> wisdom, and <i>these</i> mighty works?"--<i>Matt.</i>, xiii, 54. "But <i>some</i> man will say, How are the dead raised up? and with <i>what</i> body do they come?"--<i>1 Cor.</i>, xv, 35. "The <i>first</i> man Adam was made a living soul; the <i>last</i> Adam was made a quickening spirit."--<i>Ib.</i>, 45. So, when one pronominal adjective "precedes an other, the former <i>must be taken</i> simply as an adjective;" as,</p>
<pre>  "Those suns are set. O rise <i>some other</i> such!"
       --<i>Cowper's Task</i>, B. ii, l. 252.
</pre>
<p>OBS. 14.--Pronominal adjectives, when their nouns are not expressed, may be parsed as representing them in <i>person, number, gender</i>, and <i>case</i>; but those who prefer it, may supply the ellipsis, and parse the adjective, <i>simply as an adjective</i>. Example: "He threatens <i>many</i>, who injures <i>one</i>."--<i>Kames</i>. Here it may be said, "<i>Many</i> is a pronominal adjective, meaning <i>many persons</i>; of the third person, plural number, masculine gender, and objective case." Or those who will take the word simply as an adjective, may say, "<i>Many</i> is a pronominal adjective, of the positive degree, compared <i>many, more, most</i>, and relating to <i>persons</i> understood." And so of "<i>one</i>," which represents, or relates to, <i>person</i> understood. Either say, "<i>One</i> is a pronominal adjective, not compared," and give the <i>three definitions</i> accordingly; or else say, "One is a pronominal adjective, relating to <i>person</i> understood; of the third person, singular number, masculine gender, and objective case," and give the <i>six</i> definitions <i>accordingly.</i></p>
<p>OBS. 15.--<i>Elder</i> for <i>older</i>, and <i>eldest</i> for <i>oldest</i>, are still frequently used; though the ancient positive, <i>eld</i> for <i>old</i>, is now obsolete. Hence some have represented <i>old</i> as having a two-fold comparison; and have placed it, not very properly, among the irregular adjectives. The comparatives <i>elder</i> and <i>better</i>, are often used as <i>nouns</i>; so are the Latin comparatives <i>superior</i> and <i>inferior, interior</i> and <i>exterior, senior</i> and <i>junior, major</i> and <i>minor</i>: as, The <i>elder's</i> advice,--One of the <i>elders</i>,--His <i>betters</i>,--Our <i>superiors</i>,--The <i>interior</i> of the country,--A handsome <i>exterior</i>,--Your <i>seniors</i>,--My <i>juniors</i>,--A <i>major</i> in the army,--He is yet a <i>minor</i>. The word <i>other</i>, which has something of the nature of a comparative, likewise takes the form of a noun, as before suggested; and, in that form, the reader, if he will, may call it a noun: as, "What do ye more than <i>others</i>?"--<i>Bible</i>. "God in thus much is bounded, that the evil hath he left unto <i>an other</i>; and <i>that</i> Dark Other <i>hath usurped the evil which Omnipotence laid down."--</i>Tupper's Book of Thoughts<i>, p. 45. Some call it a pronoun. But it seems to be</i> pronominal, merely by ellipsis of the noun after it; although, unlike a mere adjective, it assumes the ending of the noun, to mark that ellipsis. Perhaps therefore, the best explanation of it would be this: "'<i>Others</i> is a pronominal adjective, having the form of a noun, and put for <i>other men</i>; in the third person, plural number, masculine gender, and nominative case." The gender of this word varies, according to that of the contrasted term; and the case, according to the relation it bears to other words. In the following example, it is neuter and objective: "The fibres of this muscle act as those of <i>others</i>."--<i>Cheyne</i>. Here, "as <i>those of others</i>," means, "as <i>the fibres</i> of <i>other muscles</i>."</p>
<p>OBS. 16.--"Comparatives and superlatives seem sometimes to part with their relative nature, and only to retain their <i>intensive</i>, especially those which are formed by the superlative adverb <i>most</i>; as, 'A <i>most learned</i> man,'--'A <i>most brave</i> man:' i. e. not the bravest or the most learned man that ever was, but a man possessing bravery or learning in a very eminent degree."--See <i>Alexander Murray's Gram.</i>, p. 110. This use of the terms of comparison is thought by some not to be very grammatical.</p>
<p>OBS. 17.--Contractions of the superlative termination <i>est</i>, as <i>high'st</i> for <i>highest, bigg'st for biggest</i>, though sometimes used by the poets, are always inelegant, and may justly be considered grammatically improper. They occur most frequently in doggerel verse, like that of <i>Hudibras</i>; the author of which work, wrote, in his droll fashion, not only the foregoing monosyllables, but <i>learned'st</i> for <i>most learned, activ'st</i> for <i>most</i> active, desperat'st <i>for</i> most desperate, epidemical'st <i>for</i> most epidemical<i>, &amp;c.</i></p>
<pre>  "And <i>th' activ'st</i> fancies share as loose alloys,
   For want of equal weight to counterpoise."--<i>Butler's Poems</i>.

<pre>   "Who therefore finds the <i>artificial'st</i> fools
   Have not been chang'd <i>i th'</i> cradle, but the schools."--<i>Ib.</i>, p. 143.
</pre>
<p>OBS. 18.--Nouns used adjectively are not varied in number to agree with the nouns to which they relate, but what is singular or plural when used substantively, is without number when taken as an adjective: as, "One of the nine <i>sister</i> goddesses."--<i>Webster's Dict., w. Muse</i>. "He has money in a <i>savings</i> bank." The latter mode of expression is uncommon, and the term <i>savings-bank</i> is sometimes compounded, but the hyphen does not really affect the nature of the former word. It is doubtful, however, whether a plural noun can ever properly assume the character of an adjective; because, if it is not then really the same as the possessive case, it will always be liable to be thought a false form of that case. What Johnson wrote "<i>fullers earth</i>" and "<i>fullers thistle</i>;" Chalmers has "<i>fullers</i> earth<i>" and "</i>fuller's thistle<i>;" Webster, "</i>fuller's-earth<i>" and</i> "<i>fuller's-thistle</i>;" Ainsworth, "<i>fuller's earth</i>" and "<i>fuller's</i> thistle<i>;" Walker has only "</i>fullers-earth<i>;" Worcester,</i> "<i>fuller's-earth</i>;" Cobb, "<i>fullers earth</i>;" the Treasury of Knowledge, "<i>fullers'-earth</i>." So unsettled is this part of our grammar, that in many such cases it is difficult cult to say whether we ought to use the apostrophe, or the hyphen, or both, or neither. To insert neither, unless we make a close compound, is to use a plural noun adjectively; which form, I think, is the most objectionable of all. See "<i>All souls</i> day<i>,"--"</i>All-fools-day<i>,"--"</i>All-saints'-day<i>," &amp;c., in the dictionaries.</i> These may well be written "<i>All Souls' Day</i>" &amp;c.</p>

<p>ERRORS OF ADJECTIVES.</p>
<p>LESSON I.--DEGREES.</p>
<p>"I have the real excuse of the honestest sort of bankrupts."--<i>Cowley's</i> Preface<i>, p. viii.</i></p>
<p>[FORMULE.--Not proper, because the adjective <i>honestest</i> is harshly compared by <i>est</i>. But, according to a principle stated on page 283d concerning the regular degrees, "This method of comparison is to be applied only to monosyllables, and to dissyllables of a smooth termination, or such as receive it and still have but one syllable after the accent." Therefore, <i>honestest</i> should be <i>most honest</i>; thus, "I have real excuse of the <i>most</i> honest <i>sort of bankrupts."]</i></p>
<p>"The honourablest part of talk, is, to give the occasion."--<i>Bacon's</i> Essays<i>, p. 90. "To give him one of his own modestest proverbs."--</i> <i>Barclay's Works</i>, iii, 340.

LESSON II.--MIXED.</p>
<p>"During the three or four first years of its existence."--<i>Taylor's District School</i>, p. 27.</p>
<p>[FORMULE.--Not proper, because the cardinal numbers, <i>three</i> and <i>four</i> are put before the ordinal <i>first</i>. But, according to the 7th part of Obs. 7th, page 280th, "In specifying any part of a series, we ought to place the cardinal number after the ordinal." Therefore the words <i>three</i> and <i>four</i> should be placed after <i>first</i>; thus, "During the <i>first three</i> or <i>four</i> years of its existence."]</p>

LESSON III.--MIXED.</p>
<p>"Brutus engaged with Aruns; and so fierce was the attack, that they pierced one another at the same time."--<i>Lempriere's Dict.</i></p>
<p>[FORMULE.--Not proper, because the phrase <i>one another</i> is here applied to two persons only, the words <i>an</i> and <i>other</i> being needlessly compounded. But, according to Observation 15th, on the Classes of Adjectives, <i>each</i> other <i>must be applied to two persons or things, and</i> one an other <i>to more</i> than two. Therefore <i>one another</i> should here be <i>each other</i>; thus, "Brutus engaged with Aruns; and so fierce was the attack, that they pierced <i>each other</i> at the same time."]</p>

"When several verbs connected by conjunctions, succeed each other in a sentence, the auxiliary is usually omitted except with the first."--<i>Frost's Gram.</i>, p. 91. "Two or more verbs, having the same nominative case, and immediately following one another, are also separated by commas." [186]--<i>Murray's Gram.</i>, p. 270; <i>C. Adams's</i>, 126; <i>Russell's</i>, 113; and others. "Two or more adverbs immediately succeeding each other, must be separated by commas."--<i>Same</i> Grammars<i>. "If, however, the members succeeding each other, are very</i> closely connected, the comma is unnecessary."--<i>Murray's Gram.</i>, p. 273; <i>Comly's</i>, 152; <i>and others</i>. "Gratitude, when exerted towards one another, naturally produces a very pleasing sensation in the mind of a grateful man."--<i>Mur.</i>, p. 287.

CHAPTER V.--PRONOUNS.</p>
<p>A Pronoun is a word used in stead of a noun: as, The boy loves <i>his</i> book; <i>he</i> has long lessons, and <i>he</i> learns <i>them</i> well.</p>
<p>The pronouns in our language are twenty-four; and their variations are thirty-two: so that the number of <i>words</i> of this class, is fifty-six.</p>
<p>OBSERVATIONS.</p>
<p>OBS. 1.--The word for which a pronoun stands, is called its <i>antecedent</i>, because it usually precedes the pronoun. But some have limited the term <i>antecedent</i> to the word represented by a <i>relative</i> pronoun. There can be no propriety in this, unless we will have every pronoun to be a relative, when it stands for a noun which precedes it; and, if so, it should be called something else, when the noun is to be found elsewhere. In the example above, <i>his</i> and <i>he</i> represent <i>boy</i>, and <i>them</i> represents <i>lessons</i>; and these nouns are as truly the antecedents to the pronouns, as any can be. Yet <i>his, he</i>, and <i>them</i>, in our most approved grammars, are not called relative pronouns, but personal.</p>
<p>OBS. 2.--Every pronoun may be explained as standing for the <i>name</i> of something, for the <i>thing itself</i> unnamed, or for a <i>former pronoun</i>; and, with the noun, pronoun, or thing, for which it stands, every pronoun must agree in person, number, and gender. The exceptions to this, whether apparent or real, are very few; and, as their occurrence is unfrequent, there will be little occasion to notice them till we come to syntax. But if the student will observe the use and import of pronouns, he may easily see, that some of them are put <i>substantively</i>, for nouns not previously introduced; some, <i>relatively</i>, for nouns or pronouns going before; some, <i>adjectively</i>, for nouns that must follow them in any explanation which can be made of the sense. These three modes of substitution, are very different, each from the others. Yet they do not serve for an accurate division of the pronouns; because it often happens, that a substitute which commonly represents the noun in one of these ways, will sometimes represent it in an other.</p>
<p>OBS. 3.--The pronouns <i>I</i> and <i>thou</i>, in their different modifications, stand immediately for persons that are, in general, sufficiently known without being named; (<i>I</i> meaning <i>the speaker</i>, and <i>thou, the hearer</i>;) their antecedents, or nouns, are therefore generally <i>understood</i>. The other personal pronouns, also, are sometimes taken in a general and demonstrative sense, to denote persons or things not previously mentioned; as, "<i>He</i> that hath knowledge, spareth his words."--<i>Bible</i>. Here <i>he</i> is equivalent to <i>the man</i>, or <i>the person</i>. "The care of posterity is most in <i>them</i> that have no posterity."--<i>Bacon</i>. Here <i>them</i> is equivalent to <i>those persons</i>. "How far do you call <i>it</i> to such a place?"--<i>Priestley's</i> Gram.<i>, p. 85. Here</i> it<i>, according to Priestley, is put for</i> the distance<i>. "For the priest's lips should keep knowledge, and</i> they <i>should</i> seek the law at his mouth."--<i>Malachi</i>, ii, 7. Here <i>they</i> is put indefinitely for <i>men</i> or <i>people</i>. So <i>who</i> and <i>which</i>, though called relatives, do not always relate to a noun or pronoun going before them; for <i>who</i> may be a direct substitute for <i>what person</i>; and <i>which</i> may mean <i>which person</i>, or <i>which thing</i>: as, "And he that was healed, wist not <i>who</i> it was."--<i>John</i>, v, 13. That is, "<i>The man who</i> was healed, knew not <i>what person</i> it was." "I care not <i>which</i> you take; they are so much alike, one cannot tell <i>which</i> is <i>which</i>."</p>
<p>OBS. 4.--A pronoun with which a question is asked, usually stands for some person or thing unknown to the speaker; the noun, therefore, cannot occur before it, but may be used after it or in place of it. Examples: "In the grave, <i>who</i> shall give thee thanks?"--<i>Ps.</i>, vi, 5. Here the word <i>who</i> is equivalent to <i>what person</i>, taken interrogatively. "Which of you convinceth me of sin?"--<i>John</i>, viii, 46. That is, "<i>Which man</i> of you?" "Master, <i>what</i> shall we do?"--<i>Luke</i>, iii, 12. That is, "<i>What act</i>, or <i>thing</i>?" These solutions, however, convert <i>which</i> and <i>what</i> into <i>adjectives</i>: and, in fact, as they have no inflections for the numbers and cases, there is reason to think them at all times essentially such. We call them pronouns, to avoid the inconvenience of supposing and supplying an infinite multitude of ellipses. But <i>who</i>, though often equivalent (as above) to an adjective and a noun, is never itself used adjectively; it is always a pronoun.</p>
<p>OBS. 5.--In respect to <i>who</i> or <i>whom</i>, it sometimes makes little or no difference to the sense, whether we take it as a demonstrative pronoun equivalent to <i>what person</i>, or suppose it to relate to an antecedent understood before it: as, "Even so the Son quickeneth <i>whom</i> he will."--<i>John</i>, v, 21. That is--"<i>what persons</i> he will," or, "<i>those</i> persons <i>whom he will;" for the Greek word for</i> whom<i>, is, in this</i> instance, plural. The former is a shorter explanation of the meaning, but the latter I take to be the true account of the construction; for, by the other, we make <i>whom</i> a double relative, and the object of two governing words at once. So, perhaps, of the following example, which Dr. Johnson cites under the word <i>who</i>, to show what he calls its "<i>disjunctive</i> sense:"--</p>
<pre>  "There thou tellst <i>of</i> kings, and <i>who</i> aspire;
   <i>Who</i> fall, <i>who</i> rise, <i>who</i> triumph, <i>who</i> do moan."--<i>Daniel</i>.
</pre>
<p>OBS. 6.--It sometimes happens that the real antecedent, or the term which in the order of the sense must stand before the pronoun, is not placed antecedently to it, in the order given to the words: as, "It is written, To <i>whom</i> he was not spoken of, <i>they</i> shall see; and they that have not heard, shall understand."--<i>Romans</i>, xv, 21. Here the sense is, "<i>They</i> to <i>whom</i> he was not spoken of, shall see." Whoever takes the passage otherwise, totally misunderstands it. And yet the same order of the words might be used to signify, "They shall see <i>to whom</i> (that is, <i>to what</i> persons<i>) he was not spoken of." Transpositions of this kind, as well as of</i> every other, occur most frequently in poetry. The following example is from an Essay on Satire, printed with Pope's Works, but written by one of his friends:--</p>
<pre>  "<i>Whose</i> is the crime, the scandal too be <i>theirs</i>;
   The knave and fool are their own libellers."--<i>J. Brown.</i>
</pre>
<p>OBS. 7.--The personal and the interrogative pronouns often stand in construction as the antecedents to other pronouns: as, "<i>He</i> also <i>that</i> is slothful in his work, is brother to <i>him that</i> is a great waster."--<i>Prov.</i>, xviii. 9. Here <i>he</i> and <i>him</i> are each equivalent to <i>the man</i>, and each is taken as the antecedent to the relative which follows it. "For both <i>he that</i> sanctifieth, and <i>they who</i> are sanctified, are all of one: for which cause, <i>he</i> is not ashamed to call <i>them</i> brethren."--<i>Heb.</i>, ii, 11. Here <i>he</i> and <i>they</i> may be considered the antecedents to <i>that</i> and <i>who</i>, of the first clause, and also to <i>he</i> and <i>them</i>, of the second. So the interrogative <i>who</i> may be the antecedent to the relative <i>that</i>; as, "<i>Who that</i> has any moral sense, dares tell lies?" Here <i>who</i>, being equivalent to <i>what person</i>, is the term with which the other pronoun agrees. Nay, an interrogative pronoun, (or the noun which is implied in it,) may be the antecedent to a <i>personal</i> pronoun; as, "<i>Who</i> hath first given to Him, and it shall be recompensed to <i>him</i> again?"--<i>Romans</i>, xi, 35. Here the idea is, "<i>What person</i> hath first given <i>any thing</i> to <i>the Lord</i>, so that it ought to be repaid <i>him</i>?" that is, "so that <i>the gift</i> ought to be recompensed from Heaven to <i>the</i> giver<i>?" In the following example, the first pronoun is the antecedent to</i> all the rest:--</p>
<pre>  "And <i>he that</i> never doubted of <i>his</i> state,
   <i>He</i> may perhaps--perhaps <i>he</i> may--too late."--<i>Cowper</i>.
</pre>
<p>OBS. 8.--So the personal pronouns of the <i>possessive</i> case, (which some call adjectives,) are sometimes represented by relatives, though less frequently than their primitives: as, "How different, O Ortogrul, is <i>thy</i> condition, <i>who</i> art doomed to the perpetual torments of unsatisfied desire!"--<i>Dr. Johnson</i>. Here <i>who</i> is of the second person, singular, masculine; and represents the antecedent pronoun <i>thy</i>: for <i>thy</i> is a pronoun, and not (as some writers will have it) an adjective. Examples like this, disprove the doctrine of those grammarians who say that <i>my, thy,</i> his, her, its<i>, and their plurals,</i> our, your, their<i>, are adjectives. For,</i> if they were mere adjectives, they could not thus be made antecedents. Examples of this construction are sufficiently common, and sufficiently clear, to settle that point, unless they can be better explained in some other way. Take an instance or two more: "And they are written for <i>our</i> admonition, upon <i>whom</i> the ends of the world are come."--<i>1 Cor.</i>, x, 11.</p>
<pre>  "Be thou the first true merit to befriend;
   <i>His</i> praise is lost, <i>who</i> stays till all commend."--<i>Pope</i>.
</pre>
<p><br>
CLASSES.</p>
<p>Pronouns are divided into three classes; <i>personal, relative</i>, and <i>interrogative</i>.</p>
<p>I. A <i>personal pronoun</i> is a pronoun that shows, by its form, of what person it is; as, "Whether <i>it</i>[187] were <i>I</i> or <i>they</i>, so <i>we</i> preach, and so <i>ye</i> believed."--<i>1 Cor.</i>, xv, 11.</p>
<p>The simple personal pronouns are five: namely, <i>I</i>, of the first person; <i>thou</i>, of the second person; <i>he, she</i>, and <i>it</i>, of the third person.</p>
<p>The compound personal pronouns are also five: namely, <i>myself</i>, of the first person; <i>thyself</i>, of the second person; <i>himself, herself</i>, and <i>itself</i>, of the third person.</p>
<p>II. A <i>relative pronoun</i> is a pronoun that represents an antecedent word or phrase, and connects different clauses of a sentence; as, "No people can be great, <i>who</i> have ceased to be virtuous."--<i>Dr. Johnson.</i></p>
<p>The relative pronouns are <i>who, which, what, that, as</i>, and the compounds <i>whoever</i> or <i>whosoever, whichever</i> or <i>whichsoever, whatever</i> or <i>whatsoever</i>.[188]</p>
<p><i>What</i> is a kind of <i>double relative</i>, equivalent to <i>that which</i> or <i>those</i> which<i>; and is to be parsed, first as antecedent, and then as relative: as,</i> "This is <i>what</i> I wanted; that is to say, <i>the thing which</i> I wanted."--<i>L.</i> Murray<i>. III. An</i> interrogative pronoun <i>is a pronoun with which a question</i> is asked; as, "<i>Who</i> touched my clothes?"--<i>Mark</i>, v, 30.</p>
<p>The interrogative pronouns are <i>who, which</i>, and <i>what</i>; being the same in form as relatives.</p>
<p><i>Who</i> demands a person's name; <i>which</i>, that a person or thing be distinguished from others; <i>what</i>, the name of a thing, or a person's occupation and character.</p>
<p><br>
OBSERVATIONS.</p>
<p>OBS. 1.--The pronouns <i>I</i> and <i>myself, thou</i> and <i>thyself</i>, with their inflections, are literally applicable to persons only; but, <i>figuratively</i>, they represent brutes, or whatever else the human imagination invests with speech and reason. The latter use of them, though literal perhaps in every thing <i>but person</i>, constitutes the purest kind of personification. For example: "The <i>trees</i> went forth on a time to anoint a king over them: and they said unto the <i>olive-tree</i>, 'Reign <i>thou</i> over <i>us</i>.' But the <i>olive-tree</i> said unto them, 'Should <i>I</i> leave <i>my</i> fatness, wherewith by <i>me</i> they honour God and man, and go to be promoted over the trees?'" See <i>Judges</i>, ix, from 8 to 16.</p>
<p>OBS. 2.--The pronouns <i>he</i> and <i>himself, she</i> and <i>herself</i>, with their inflections, are literally applicable to persons and to brutes, and to these only; if applied to lifeless objects, they animate them, and are figurative <i>in gender</i>, though literal perhaps in every other respect. For example: "A <i>diamond</i> of beauty and lustre, observing at <i>his</i> side in the same cabinet, not only many other gems, but even a <i>loadstone</i>, began to question the latter how <i>he</i> came there--<i>he, who</i> appeared to be no better than a mere flint, a sorry rusty-looking pebble, without the least shining quality to advance <i>him</i> to such honour; and concluded with desiring <i>him</i> to keep <i>his</i> distance, and to pay a proper respect to <i>his</i> superiors."--<i>Kames's Art of Thinking</i>, p. 226.</p>
<p>OBS. 3.--The pronoun <i>it</i>, as it carries in itself no such idea as that of personality, or sex, or life, is chiefly used with reference to things inanimate; yet the word is, in a certain way, applicable to animals, or even to persons; though it does not, in itself, present them as such. Thus we say, "<i>It</i> is <i>I</i>;"--"<i>It</i> was <i>they</i>;"--"<i>It</i> was <i>you</i>;"--"<i>It</i> was your <i>agent</i>;"--"<i>It</i> is your <i>bull</i> that has killed one of my oxen." In examples of this kind, the word <i>it</i> is simply demonstrative; meaning, <i>the</i> thing or subject spoken of<i>. That subject, whatever it be in itself, may be</i> introduced again after the verb, in any person, number, or gender, that suits it. But, as the verb agrees with the pronoun <i>it</i>, the word which follows, can in no sense be made, as Dr. Priestley will have it to be, the <i>antecedent</i> to that pronoun. Besides, it is contrary to the nature of what is primarily demonstrative, to represent a preceding word of any kind. The Doctor absurdly says, "Not only things, but persons, may be the <i>antecedent</i> to this pronoun; as, <i>Who is it</i>? <i>Is it not Thomas</i>? i. e. <i>Who is the person</i>? <i>Is not he Thomas?</i>"--<i>Priestley's Gram.</i>, p. 85. In these examples, the terms are transposed by interrogation; but that circumstance, though it may have helped to deceive this author and his copiers, affects not my assertion.</p>
<p>OBS. 4.--The pronoun <i>who</i> is usually applied only to persons. Its application to brutes or to things is improper, unless we mean to personify them. But <i>whose</i>, the possessive case of this relative, is sometimes used to supply the place of the possessive case, otherwise wanting, to the relative <i>which</i>. Examples: "The mutes are those consonants <i>whose</i> sounds cannot be protracted."--<i>Murray's Gram.</i>, p. 9. "Philosophy, <i>whose</i> end is, to instruct us in the knowledge of nature."--<i>Ib.</i>, p. 54; <i>Campbell's</i> Rhet.<i>, 421. "Those adverbs are compared</i> whose <i>primitives are</i> obsolete."--<i>Adam's Latin Gram.</i>, p. 150. "After a sentence <i>whose</i> sense is complete in itself, a period is used."--<i>Nutting's Gram.</i>, p. 124. "We remember best those things <i>whose</i> parts are methodically disposed, and mutually connected."--<i>Beattie's Moral Science</i>, i, 59. "Is there any other doctrine <i>whose</i> followers are punished?"--ADDISON: <i>Murray's Gram.</i>, p. 54; <i>Lowth's</i>, p. 25.</p>
<pre>  "The question, <i>whose</i> solution I require,
   Is, what the sex of women most desire."--DRYDEN: <i>Lowth</i>, p. 25.
</pre>
<p>OBS. 5.--Buchanan, as well as Lowth, condemns the foregoing use of <i>whose</i>, except in grave poetry: saying, "This manner of <i>personification</i> adds an air of dignity to the higher and more solemn kind of poetry, but it is highly improper in the lower kind, or in prose."--<i>Buchanan's English</i> Syntax<i>, p. 73. And, of the last two examples above quoted, he says, "It</i> ought to be <i>of which</i>, in both places: i. e. The followers <i>of which</i>; the solution <i>of which</i>."--<i>Ib.</i>, p. 73. The truth is, that no personification is here intended. Hence it may be better to avoid, if we can, this use of <i>whose</i>, as seeming to imply what we do not mean. But Buchanan himself (stealing the text of an older author) has furnished at least one example as objectionable as any of the foregoing: "Prepositions are naturally placed betwixt the Words <i>whose</i> Relation and Dependence each of them is to express."--<i>English Syntax</i>, p. 90; <i>British Gram.</i>, p. 201. I dislike this construction, and yet sometimes adopt it, for want of another as good. It is too much, to say with Churchill, that "this practice is now discountenanced by all correct writers."--<i>New Gram.</i>, p. 226. Grammarians would perhaps differ less, if they would read more. Dr. Campbell commends the use of <i>whose</i> for <i>of which</i>, as an improvement suggested by good taste, and established by abundant authority. See <i>Philosophy of Rhetoric</i>, p. 420. "WHOSE, the possessive or genitive case of <i>who</i> or <i>which</i>; applied to persons or things."--<i>Webster's Octavo Dict.</i> "<i>Whose</i> is well authorized by good usage, as the possessive of <i>which</i>."--<i>Sanborn's</i> Gram.<i>, p. 69. "Nor is any language complete,</i> whose <i>verbs have not</i> tenses."--<i>Harris's Hermes</i>.</p>
<pre>  "--------'Past and future, are the wings
   On <i>whose</i> support, harmoniously conjoined,
   Moves the great spirit of human knowledge.'--MS."
          <i>Wordsworth's Preface to his Poems</i>, p. xviii.
</pre>
<p>OBS. 6.--The relative <i>which</i>, though formerly applied to persons and made equivalent to <i>who</i>, is now confined to brute animals and inanimate things. Thus, "Our Father <i>which</i> art in heaven," is not now reckoned good English; it should be, "Our Father <i>who</i> art in heaven." In this, as well as in many other things, the custom of speech has changed; so that what was once right, is now ungrammatical. The use of <i>which</i> for <i>who</i> is very common in the Bible, and in other books of the seventeenth century; but all good writers now avoid the construction. It occurs seventy-five times in the third chapter of Luke; as, "Joseph, <i>which</i> was the son of Heli, <i>which</i> was the son of Matthat," etc. etc. After a personal term taken by metonymy for a thing, <i>which</i> is not improper; as, "Of the particular <i>author which</i> he is studying."--<i>Gallaudet</i>. And as an interrogative or a demonstrative pronoun or adjective, the word <i>which</i> is still applicable to persons, as formerly; as, "<i>Which</i> of you all?"--"<i>Which</i> man of you all?"--"There arose a reasoning among them, <i>which</i> of them should be the greatest."--<i>Luke</i>, ix, 46. "Two fair twins--the puzzled Strangers, <i>which</i> is <i>which</i>, inquire."--<i>Tickell</i>.</p>
<p>OBS. 7.--If <i>which</i>, as a direct relative, is inapplicable to persons, <i>who</i> ought to be preferred to it in all personifications: as,</p>
<pre>  "The seal is set. Now welcome thou dread power,
   Nameless, yet thus omnipotent, <i>which</i> here
   Walk'st in the shadow of the midnight hour."
       BYRON: <i>Childe Harold's Pilgrimage</i>, Cant, iv, st. 138.
</pre>
<p>What sort of personage is here imagined and addressed, I will not pretend to say; but it should seem, that <i>who</i> would be more proper than <i>which</i>, though less agreeable in sound before the word <i>here</i>. In one of his notes on this word, Churchill has fallen into a strange error. He will have <i>who</i> to represent a <i>horse!</i> and that, in such a sense, as would require <i>which</i> and not <i>who</i>, even for a person. As he prints the masculine pronoun in Italics, perhaps he thought, with Murray and Webster, that <i>which</i> must needs be "of the <i>neuter gender</i>." [189] He says, "In the following passage, <i>which</i> seems to be used <i>instead</i> of <i>who</i>:--</p>
<pre>   'Between two horses, <i>which</i> doth bear him best;
   I have, perhaps, some shallow spirit of judgment'
                  SHAKS., 1 Hen. VI."--<i>Churchill's Gram.</i>, p. 226.
</pre>
<p>OBS. 8.--The pronoun <i>what</i> is usually applied to things only. It has a twofold relation, and is often used (by ellipsis of the noun) both as antecedent and as relative, in the form of a single word; being equivalent to <i>that which</i>, or <i>the thing which,--those which</i>, or <i>the things which</i>. In this double relation, <i>what</i> represents two cases at the same time: as, "He is ashamed of <i>what</i> he has done;" that is, "of what [<i>thing</i> or <i>action</i>] he has done;"--or, "of <i>that</i> [thing or action] <i>which</i> he has done." Here are two objectives. The two cases are sometimes alike, sometimes different; for either of them may be the nominative, and either, the objective. Examples: "The dread of censure ought not to prevail <i>over</i> what is <i>proper."--</i>Kames, El. of Crit.<i>, Vol. i, p. 252. "The public ear</i> will not easily <i>bear what is</i> slovenly and incorrect."--<i>Blair's Rhet.</i>, p. 12. "He who buys <i>what</i> he does not need, will often need <i>what</i> he cannot buy."--<i>Student's Manual</i>, p. 290. "<i>What</i> is just, is honest; and again, <i>what</i> is honest, is just."--<i>Cicero</i>. "He that hath an ear, let him hear <i>what</i> the Spirit saith unto the churches."--<i>Rev.</i>, ii, 7, 11, 17, 29; iii, 6, 13, 22.</p>
<p>OBS. 9.--This pronoun, <i>what</i>, is usually of the singular number, though sometimes plural: as, "I must turn to the faults, or <i>what appear</i> such to me."--<i>Byron</i>. "All distortions and mimicries, as such, are <i>what raise</i> aversion instead of pleasure."--<i>Steele</i>. "Purified indeed from <i>what</i> appear <i>to be its real defects."--</i>Wordsworth's Pref.<i>, p. xix. "Every</i> single impression, made even by the same object, is distinguishable from <i>what</i> have gone before, and from <i>what</i> succeed."--<i>Kames, El. of Crit.</i>, Vol. i, p. 107. "Sensible people express no thoughts but <i>what</i> make some figure."--<i>Ib.</i>, Vol. i, p. 399. The following example, which makes <i>what</i> both singular and plural at once, is a manifest solecism: "<i>What has</i> since followed <i>are</i> but natural consequences."--J. C. CALHOUN, <i>Speech in U. S.</i> Senate<i>, March 4, 1850. Here</i> has <i>should be</i> have<i>; or else the form</i> should be this: "What has since followed, <i>is</i> but <i>a</i> natural <i>consequence</i>."</p>
<p>OBS. 10.--The common import of this remarkable pronoun, <i>what</i>, is, as we see in the foregoing examples, twofold; but some instances occur, in which it does not appear to have this double construction, but to be simply declaratory; and many, in which the word is simply an adjective: as, "<i>What</i> a strange run of luck I have had to-day!"--<i>Columbian Orator</i>, p. 293. Here <i>what</i> is a mere adjective; and, in the following examples, a pronoun indefinite:--</p>
<pre>  "I tell thee <i>what</i>, corporal, I could tear her."--<i>Shak.</i>
</pre>
<pre>   "He knows <i>what's what</i>, and that's as high
   As metaphysic wit can fly."--<i>Hudibras</i>.
</pre>
<p>OBS. 11.--<i>What</i> is sometimes used both as an adjective and as a relative at the same time, and is placed before the noun which it represents; being equivalent to the adjective <i>any</i> or <i>all</i>, and the simple relative <i>who,</i> which<i>[190] or</i> that<i>: as, "</i>What <i>money we had, was taken away." That is,</i> "<i>All the</i> money <i>that</i> we had, was taken away." "<i>What</i> man but enters, dies." That is, "<i>Any</i> man <i>who</i> enters, dies." "It was agreed that <i>what</i> goods were aboard his vessels, should be landed."--<i>Mickle's India</i>, p. 89. "<i>What</i> appearances of worth afterwards succeeded, were drawn from thence."--<i>Internal Policy of Great Britain</i>, p. 196. That is, "<i>All the</i> appearances of worth, <i>which</i> afterwards succeeded."--<i>Priestley's Gram.</i>, p. 93. Indeed, this pronoun does not admit of being construed after a noun, as a simple relative: none but the most illiterate ever seriously use it so. <i>What</i> put for <i>who</i> or <i>which</i>, is therefore a ludicrous vulgarism; as, "The aspiring youth <i>what</i> fired the Ephesian dome."--<i>Jester</i>. The word used as above, however, does not always preclude the introduction of a personal pronoun before the subsequent verb; as,[191]</p>
<pre>  "<i>What</i> god but enters yon forbidden field,
   Who yields assistance, or but wills to yield,
   Back to the skies with shame <i>he</i> shall be driven,
   Gash'd with dishonest wounds, the scorn of heaven."--<i>Pope's Homer</i>.
</pre>
<p>OBS. 12.--The compound <i>whatever</i> or <i>whatsoever</i> has the same peculiarities of construction as has the simpler word <i>what</i>: as, "Whatever word expresses an affirmation, or assertion, is a verb; or thus, <i>Whatever</i> word, with a noun or pronoun before or after it, makes full sense, is a verb."--<i>Adam's Latin Gram.</i>, p. 78. That is, "<i>Any</i> word <i>which</i> expresses," &amp;c. "We will certainly do <i>whatsoever</i> thing goeth forth out of our own mouth."--<i>Jeremiah</i>, xliv, 17. That is--"<i>any</i> thing, or <i>every</i> thing, <i>which</i>." "<i>Whatever</i> sounds are difficult in pronunciation, are, in the same proportion, harsh and painful to the ear."--<i>Blair's Rhet.</i>, p. 121; <i>Murray's Gram.</i>, p. 325. "<i>Whatsoever</i> things were written aforetime, were written for our learning."--<i>Romans</i>, xv, 4. In all these examples, the word <i>whatever</i> or <i>whatsoever</i> appears to be used both adjectively and relatively. There are instances, however, in which the relation of this term is not twofold, but simple: as, "<i>Whatever</i> useful or engaging endowments we possess, virtue is requisite in order to their shining with proper lustre."--<i>English Reader</i>, p. 23. Here <i>whatever</i> is simply an adjective. "The declarations contained in them [the Scriptures] rest on the authority of God <i>himself</i>; and there can be no appeal from them to any other authority <i>whatsoever</i>."--<i>London Epistle</i>, 1836. Here <i>whatsoever</i> may be parsed either as an adjective relating to <i>authority</i>, or as an emphatic pronoun in apposition with its noun, like <i>himself</i> in the preceding clause. In this general explanatory sense, <i>whatsoever</i> may be applied to persons as well as to things; as, "I should be sorry if it entered into the imagination <i>of any person whatsoever</i>, that I was preferred to all other patrons."--<i>Duncan's Cicero</i>, p. 11. Here the word <i>whomsoever</i> might have been used.</p>
<p>OBS. 13.--But there is an other construction to be here explained, in which <i>whatever</i> or <i>whatsoever</i> appears to be a <i>double relative</i>, or a term which includes both antecedent and relative; as, "<i>Whatever</i> purifies, fortifies also the heart."--<i>English Reader</i>, p. 23. That is. "<i>All that</i> purifies<i>--or,</i> Everything which <i>purifies--fortifies also the heart."</i> "<i>Whatsoever</i> he doeth, shall prosper."--<i>Psal.</i>, i, 3. That is, "<i>All</i> that <i>he doeth--or,</i> All the things which he doeth<i>--shall prosper." This</i> construction, however, may be supposed elliptical. The Latin expression is, "<i>Omnia quæcumque faciet prosperabuntur</i>."--<i>Vulgate</i>. The Greek is similar: [Greek: "Kai panta hosa an poiæi kateuodothæsetai."]-- <i>Septuagint</i>. It is doubtless by some sort of ellipsis which familiarity of use inclines us to overlook, that <i>what, whatever</i>, and <i>whatsoever</i>, which are essentially adjectives, have become susceptible of this double construction as pronouns. But it is questionable what particular ellipsis we ought here to suppose, or whether any; and certainly, we ought always to avoid the supposing of an ellipsis, if we can.[192] Now if we say the meaning is, "Whatsoever <i>things</i> he doeth, shall prosper;" this, though analogous to other expressions, does not simplify the construction. If we will have it to be, "Whatsoever <i>things</i> he doeth, <i>they</i> shall prosper;" the pronoun <i>they</i> appears to be pleonastic. So is the word <i>it</i>, in the text, "<i>Whatsoever</i> he saith unto you, do <i>it</i>."--<i>John</i>, ii, 5. If we say the full phrase is, "<i>All things</i> whatsoever he doeth, shall prosper;" this presents, to an English ear, a still more obvious pleonasm. It may be, too, <i>a borrowed idiom</i>, found nowhere but in translations; as, "<i>All things</i> whatsoever <i>ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye shall receive."--</i>Matt.<i>,</i> xxi, 22. From these views, there seems to be some objection to any and every method of parsing the above-mentioned construction as <i>elliptical</i>. The learner may therefore say, in such instances, that <i>whatever</i> or <i>whatsoever</i> is a double relative, including both antecedent and relative; and parse it, first as antecedent, in connexion with the latter verb, and then as relative, in connexion with the former. But let him observe that the order of the verbs may be the reverse of the foregoing; as, "Ye are my friends, if ye <i>do</i> whatsoever I <i>command</i> you."--<i>John</i>, xv, 14. That is, according to the Greek, "If ye do whatsoever I command <i>to</i> you;" Though it would be better English to say, "If ye do whatsoever I command you <i>to</i> do<i>." In the following example, however, it seems proper to recognize an</i> ellipsis; nay, the omissions in the construction of the last line, are as many as three or four;--</p>
<pre>  "Expatiate with glad step, and choose at will
   Whate'er bright spoils the florid earth contains,
   Whate'er the waters, or the liquid air."--<i>Akenside</i>.
</pre>
<p>OBS. 14.--As the simple word <i>who</i> differs from <i>which</i> and <i>what</i>, in being always a declinable pronoun; so its compounds differ from theirs, in being incapable of either of the double constructions above described. Yet <i>whoever</i> and <i>whoso</i> or <i>whosoever</i>, as well as <i>whichever</i> and <i>whichsoever, whatever</i> and <i>whatsoever</i>, derive, from the affix which is added, or from the peculiarity of their syntax, an unlimited signification--or a signification which is limited only by the following verb; and, as some general term, such as <i>any person</i>, or <i>all persons</i>, is implied as the antecedent, they are commonly connected with other words as if they stood for two cases at once: as, "<i>Whoever</i> seeks, shall find." That is, "<i>Any person who</i> seeks, shall find." But as the case of this compound, like that of the simple word <i>who, whose</i>, or <i>whom</i>, is known and determined by its form, it is necessary, in parsing, to treat this phraseology as being elliptical. The compounds of <i>who</i> do not, therefore, actually stand for two cases, though some grammarians affirm that they do.[193] Example: "The soldiers made proclamation, that they would sell the empire to <i>whoever</i> would purchase it at the highest price."--<i>Goldsmith's</i> Rome<i>, p. 231. That is--"to</i> any man who <i>would purchase it." The affix</i> <i>ever</i> or <i>soever</i> becomes unnecessary when the ellipsis is supplied; and this fact, it must be confessed, is a plausible argument against the supposition of an ellipsis. But the supposing of an antecedent understood, is here unavoidable; because the preposition <i>to</i> cannot govern the nominative case, and the word <i>whoever</i> cannot be an objective. And so in all other instances in which the two cases are different: as, "He bids <i>whoever</i> is athirst, to come."--<i>Jenks's Devotions</i>, p. 151. "Elizabeth publicly threatened, that she would have the head of <i>whoever</i> had advised it."--HUME: <i>in Priestley's Gram.</i>, p. 104.</p>
<p>OBS. 15.--If it is necessary in parsing to supply the antecedent to <i>whoever</i> or <i>whosoever</i>, when two <i>different</i> cases are represented, it is but analogous and reasonable to supply it also when two similar cases occur: as, "<i>Whoever</i> borrows money, <i>is bound</i> in conscience to repay it."--<i>Paley</i>. "<i>Whoever</i> is eager to find excuses for vice and folly, <i>will find</i> his own backwardness to practise them much diminished."-- <i>Chapone</i>. "<i>Whoever</i> examines his own imperfections, <i>will cease</i> to be fastidious; <i>whoever</i> restrains humour and caprice, <i>will cease</i> to be squeamish."--<i>Crabb's Synonymes</i>. In all these examples, we have the word in the third person, singular number, masculine gender, and nominative case. And here it is most commonly found. It is always of the third person; and, though its number <i>may</i> be plural; its gender, feminine; its case, possessive or objective; we do not often use it in any of these ways. In some instances, the latter verb is attended with an other pronoun, which represents the same person or persons; as, "And <i>whosoever</i> will, let <i>him</i> take of the water of life freely."--<i>Rev.</i>, xxii, 17. The case of this compound relative always depends upon what follows it, and not upon what precedes; as, "Or ask of <i>whomsoever</i> he has taught."--<i>Cowper</i>. That is--"of <i>any person whom</i> he has taught." In the following text, we have the possessive plural: "<i>Whosesoever</i> sins ye remit, they are remitted unto <i>them</i>."--<i>John</i>, xx, 23. That is, "<i>Whatever persons'</i> sins."</p>
<p>OBS. 16.--In such phraseology as the following, there is a stiffness which ought to be avoided: "For <i>whomever</i> God loves, he loves <i>them</i> in Christ, and no otherways."--<i>Barclay's Works</i>, Vol. iii, p. 215. Better: "For <i>all</i> whom <i>God loves, he loves in Christ, and no</i> otherwise<i>." "When the Father</i> draws, <i>whomever</i> he draws, may come."--<i>Penington</i>. Better: "When the Father draws, <i>all whom</i> he draws, (or, <i>every one whom</i> he draws.) may come." A modern critic of immense promise cites the following clause as being found in the Bible: "But he loveth <i>whomsoever</i> followeth after righteousness."--<i>O. B. Peirce's Gram.</i>, p. 72. It is lamentable to see the unfaithfulness of this gentleman's quotations. About half of them are spurious; and I am confident that this one is neither Scripture nor good English. The compound relative, being the subject of <i>followeth</i>, should be in the nominative case; for the object of the verb <i>loveth</i> is the antecedent <i>every one</i>, understood. But the idea may be better expressed, without any ellipsis, thus: "He loveth <i>every one who</i> followeth after righteousness." The following example from the same hand is also wrong, and the author's rule and reasoning connected with it, are utterly fallacious: "I will give the reward to <i>whomsoever</i> will apprehend the rogue."--<i>Ib.</i>, p. 256. Much better say, "<i>to any one who</i>;" but, if you choose the compound word, by all analogy, and all good authority, it must here be <i>whoever</i> or <i>whosoever</i>. The shorter compound <i>whoso</i>, which occurs very frequently in the Bible, is now almost obsolete in prose, but still sometimes used by the poets. It has the same meaning as <i>whosoever</i>, but appears to have been confined to the nominative singular; and <i>whatso</i> is still more rare: as, "<i>Whoso</i> diggeth a pit, shall fall therein."--<i>Prov.</i>, xxvi, 27.</p>
<pre>  "Which <i>whoso</i> tastes, can be enslaved no more."--<i>Cowper</i>.
</pre>
<pre>   "On their intended journey to proceed,
   And over night <i>whatso</i> thereto did need."--<i>Hubbard</i>.
</pre>
<p>OBS. 17.--The relative <i>that</i> is applied indifferently to persons, to brute animals, and to inanimate things. But the word <i>that</i> is not always a relative pronoun. It is sometimes a pronoun, sometimes an adjective, and sometimes a conjunction. I call it not a demonstrative pronoun and also a relative; because, in the sense in which Murray and others have styled it a "demonstrative adjective <i>pronoun</i>," it is a pronominal <i>adjective</i>, and it is better to call it so. (1.) It is a <i>relative pronoun</i> whenever it is equivalent to <i>who, whom</i>, or <i>which</i>: as, "There is not a <i>just man</i> upon earth, <i>that</i> doeth good, and sinneth not"--<i>Eccl.</i>, vii, 20. "It was diverse from all the <i>beasts that</i> were before it."--<i>Dan.</i>, vii, 7. "And he had a <i>name</i> written, <i>that</i> no man knew but he himself."--<i>Rev.</i>, xix, 12. (2.) It is a <i>pronominal adjective</i> whenever it relates to a noun expressed or understood after it: as, "Thus with violence shall <i>that</i> great <i>city</i>, Babylon, be thrown down."--<i>Rev.</i>, xviii, 21. "Behold <i>that</i> [thing] which I have seen."--<i>Eccl.</i>, v, 18. "And they said, 'What is <i>that</i>[194] [matter] to us? See thou to <i>that'</i> [matter]."--<i>Matt.</i>, xxvii, 4. (3.) In its other uses, it is a <i>conjunction</i>, and, as such, it most commonly makes what follows it, the purpose, object, or final cause, of what precedes it: as, "I read <i>that</i> I may learn."--<i>Dr. Adam.</i> "Ye men of Athens, I perceive <i>that</i> in all things ye are too superstitious."--<i>St.</i> Paul. <i>"Live well,</i> that <i>you may die well."--</i>Anon. <i>"Take heed</i> that thou speak not to Jacob."--<i>Genesis.</i> "Judge not, <i>that</i> ye be not judged."--<i>Matthew.</i></p>
<p>OBS. 18.--The word <i>that</i>, or indeed any other word, should never be so used as to leave the part of speech uncertain; as, "For in the day <i>that</i> thou eatest thereof, thou shalt surely die."--<i>Gen.</i>, ii, 17. Here <i>that</i> seems to be a relative <i>pronoun</i>, representing <i>day</i>, in the third person, singular, neuter; yet, in other respects, it seems to be a <i>conjunction</i>, because there is nothing to determine its case. Better: "For in the day <i>on</i> which <i>thou eatest thereof, thou shalt surely die." This mongrel</i> construction of the word <i>that</i>, were its justification possible, is common enough in our language to be made good English. But it must needs be condemned, because it renders the character of the term ambiguous, and is such a grammatical difficulty as puts the parser at a dead nonplus. Examples: (1.) "But <i>at the same time</i> THAT men are giving their orders, God on his part is likewise giving his."--<i>Rollin's Hist.</i>, ii, 106. Here the phrase, "<i>at the same time that</i>," is only equivalent to the adverb <i>while</i>; and yet it is incomplete, because it means, "<i>at the same time at</i> which<i>," or, "</i>at the very time at which.<i>" (2.) "The author of this work,</i> <i>at the same time</i> THAT he has endeavoured to avoid a plan, <i>which may be</i> too concise or too extensive, defective in its parts or irregular in the disposition of them, has studied to render his <i>subject</i> sufficiently easy, intelligible, and <i>comprehensive.</i>"--<i>Murray's Gram., Introd.</i>, p. 1. This sentence, which is no unfair specimen of its author's original style, needs three corrections: 1. For "<i>at the same time that</i>," say <i>while</i>: 2. Drop the phrase, "<i>which may be</i>," because it is at least useless: 3. For "<i>subject</i>," read <i>treatise</i>, or <i>compilation.</i> You will thus have tolerable diction. Again: (3.) "The participles of active verbs <i>act upon</i> objects <i>and govern them in the objective case, in the same manner</i> that the verbs <i>do</i>, from which they are derived. <i>A participle</i> in the nature of an adjective, belongs or refers to <i>nouns</i> or <i>pronouns</i> in the same manner <i>that</i> adjectives do; and <i>when it will admit</i> the degrees of comparison, <i>it is called</i> a participial <i>adjective</i>."--<i>Sanborn's Gram.</i>, p. 38. This is the style of a gentleman of no ordinary pretensions, one who thinks he has produced the best grammar that has ever appeared in our language. To me, however, his work suggests an abundance of questions like these; each of which would palpably involve him in a dilemma: What is here meant by "<i>objects</i>," the <i>words</i>, or the <i>things?</i> if the former, how are they acted upon? if the latter, how are they governed? If "a <i>participle</i> is called an <i>adjective</i>," which is it, an adjective, or a participle? If "<i>a</i> participle refers to <i>nouns</i> or <i>pronouns</i>," <i>how many</i> of these are required by the relation? When does a <i>participle</i> "admit the degrees of comparison?" How shall we parse the word <i>that</i> in the foregoing sentences?</p>
<p>OBS. 19.--The word <i>as</i>, though usually a conjunction or an adverb, has sometimes the construction of a relative pronoun, especially after <i>such,</i> so many<i>, or</i> as many<i>; and, whatever the antecedent</i> noun <i>may be, this is</i> the <i>only fit relative</i> to follow any of these terms in a restrictive sense. Examples: "We have been accustomed to repose on its veracity with <i>such</i> humble confidence <i>as</i> suppresses curiosity."--<i>Johnson's Life of</i> Cowley. <i>"The malcontents made</i> such <i>demands</i> as <i>none but a tyrant could</i> refuse."--<i>Bolingbroke, on Hist.</i>, Let. 7. "The Lord added to the church daily <i>such</i> [persons] <i>as</i> should be saved."--<i>Acts</i>, ii, 47. "And <i>as</i> many as <i>were ordained to eternal life, believed."--</i>Acts<i>, xiii, 48. "</i>As many as <i>I love, I rebuke and chasten."--</i>Rev.<i>, iii, 19. "Know ye not,</i> that <i>so many</i> of us <i>as</i> were baptized into Jesus Christ, were baptized into his death?"--<i>Rom.</i>, vi, 3. "For <i>as many</i> of you <i>as</i> have been baptized into Christ, have put on Christ."--<i>Gal.</i>, iii, 27. "A syllable is <i>so many</i> letters <i>as</i> are spoken with one motion of the voice."--<i>Perley's</i> Gram.<i>, p. 8. "The compound tenses are</i> such as <i>cannot be formed without</i> an auxiliary verb."--<i>Murray's Gram.</i>, p. 91. "Send him <i>such</i> books <i>as</i> will please him."--<i>Webster's Improved Gram.</i>, p. 37. "In referring to <i>such</i> a division of the day <i>as</i> is past, we use the imperfect."-- <i>Murray's Gram.</i>, p. 70. "Participles have <i>the same</i> government <i>as</i> the verbs from which they are derived."--<i>Ib.</i>, Rule xiv. "Participles have <i>the same</i> government <i>as</i> the verbs <i>have</i> from which they are derived."-- <i>Sanborn's Gram.</i>, p. 94. In some of these examples, <i>as</i> is in the nominative case, and in others, in the objective; in some, it is of the masculine gender, and in others, it is neuter; in some, it is of the plural number, and in others, it is singular: but in all, it is of the third person; and in all, its person, number, gender, and case, are as obvious as those of any invariable pronoun can be.</p>
<p>OBS. 20.--Some writers--(the most popular are Webster, Bullions, Wells, and Chandler--) imagine that <i>as</i>, in such sentences as the foregoing, can be made a conjunction, and not a pronoun, if we will allow them to consider the phraseology elliptical. Of the example for which I am indebted to him, Dr. Webster says, "<i>As</i> must be considered as the nominative to <i>will please</i>, or we must suppose an ellipsis of several words: as, 'Send him such books as <i>the books which</i> will please him, or as <i>those which</i> will please him.'"--<i>Improved Gram.</i>, p. 37. This pretended explanation must be rejected as an absurdity. In either form of it, <i>two</i> nominatives are idly imagined between <i>as</i> and its verb; and, I ask, of what is the first one the subject? If you say, "Of <i>are</i> understood," making the phrase, "such books <i>as the books are</i>;" does not <i>as</i> bear the same relation to this new verb <i>are</i>, that is found in the pronoun <i>who</i>, when one says, "Tell him <i>who</i> you <i>are?</i>" If so, <i>as</i> is a pronoun still; so that, thus far, you gain nothing. And if you will have the whole explanation to be, "Send him such books <i>as the books are books which</i> will please him;" you multiply words, and finally arrive at nothing, but tautology and nonsense. Wells, not condescending to show his pupils what he would supply after this <i>as</i>, thinks it sufficient to say, the word is "followed by an ellipsis of one or more words required to complete the construction; as, 'He was the father of all such as [] handle the harp and organ.'--<i>Gen.</i> 4: 21."--<i>Wells's School</i> Gram.<i>, 1st Ed., p. 164; 3d Ed., p. 172.</i></p>
<p>OBS. 21.--Chandler exhibits the sentence, "<i>These are not such as are</i> worn<i>;" and, in parsing it, expounds the words</i> as <i>and</i> are<i>, thus; the</i> crotchets being his, not mine: "<i>as</i>.... is an <i>adverb, connecting</i> the two sentences in comparing them, [<i>It is a fault</i> of some, that they make <i>as</i> a pronoun, when, in a comparative sentence, it corresponds with <i>such</i>, and is immediately followed by a verb, as in the sentence now given. This is probably done <i>from an ignorance</i> of the real nominative to the verb. The sentence <i>should stand thus</i>: 'These (<i>perhaps</i> bonnets) are not such (bonnets) <i>as</i> (those bonnets) are (which are) worn.' Then] <i>are</i> .... is the substantive verb, third person, plural number, indicative mood, present tense, and agrees with the noun <i>bonnets</i>, understood."--<i>Chandler's Common</i> School Gram.<i>, p. 162. All this bears the marks of shallow flippancy. No</i> part of it is accurate. "<i>Are worn</i>," which the critic unwarrantably divides by his misplaced curves and uncouth impletions, is a passive verb, agreeing with the pronoun <i>as</i>. But the text itself is faulty, being unintelligible through lack of a noun; for, of things that <i>may be</i> "<i>worn</i>," there are a thousand different sorts. Is it not ridiculous, for a great grammarian to offer, as a model for parsing, what he himself, "<i>from</i> an ignorance <i>of the real nominative," can only interpret with a</i> "<i>perhaps?</i>" But the noun which this author supplies, the meaning which he guesses that he had, he here very improperly stows away within a pair of <i>crotchets</i>. Nor is it true, that "the sentence <i>should stand</i>" as above exhibited; for the tautological correction not only has the very extreme of awkwardness, but still makes <i>as</i> a pronoun, a nominative, belonging after <i>are</i>: so that the phrase, "<i>as are worn</i>," is only encumbered and perverted by the verbose addition made. So of an other example given by this expounder, in which <i>as</i> is an objective: "He is exactly such a man <i>as</i> I saw."--<i>Chandler's Com. Sch. Gram.</i>, p. 163. Here <i>as</i> is the object of <i>saw</i>. But the author says, "The sentence, however, <i>should stand</i> thus: 'He is exactly such a man <i>as</i> that person <i>was</i> whom I saw.'"--<i>Ibid.</i> This inelegant alteration makes <i>as</i> a nominative dependent on <i>was.</i></p>
<p>OBS. 22.--The use of <i>as</i> for a relative pronoun, is almost entirely confined to those connexions in which no other relative would be proper; hence few instances occur, of its absolute equivalence to <i>who, which</i>, or <i>that</i>, by which to establish its claim to the same rank. Examples like the following, however, go far to prove it, if proof be necessary; because <i>who</i> and <i>which</i> are here employed, where <i>as</i> is certainly now required by all good usage: "It is not only convenient, but absolutely needful, that there be certain meetings at certain places and times, <i>as</i> may best suit the convenience of <i>such, who</i> may be most particularly concerned in them."--<i>Barclay's Works</i>, Vol. i, p. 495. "Which, no doubt, will be found obligatory upon all <i>such, who</i> have a sense and feeling of the mind of the Spirit."--<i>Ib.</i>, i, p. 578. "Condemning or removing <i>such</i> things, <i>which</i> in themselves are evil."--<i>Ib.</i>, i, p. 511. In these citations, not only are <i>who</i> and <i>which</i> improperly used for <i>as</i>, but the <i>commas</i> before them are also improper, because the relatives are intended to be taken in a restrictive sense. "If there be <i>such that</i> walk disorderly now."--<i>Ib.</i>, i, p. 488. Here <i>that</i> ought to be <i>as</i>; or else <i>such</i> ought to be <i>persons</i>, or <i>those.</i> "When such virtues, <i>as which</i> still accompany the truth, are necessarily supposed to be wanting."--<i>Ib.</i>, i, p. 502. Here <i>which</i>, and the comma before <i>as</i>, should both be expunged. "I shall raise in their minds the same course of thought <i>as</i> has taken possession of my own."--<i>Duncan's Logic</i>, p. 61. "The pronoun must be in the same case <i>as</i> the antecedent would be <i>in</i>, if substituted for it."--<i>Murray's Gram.</i>, p. 181. "The verb must therefore have the same construction <i>as</i> it has in the following sentence."--<i>Murray's Key</i>, p. 190. Here <i>as</i> is exactly equivalent to the relative <i>that</i>, and either may be used with equal propriety. We cannot avoid the conclusion, therefore, that, as the latter word is sometimes a conjunction and sometimes a pronoun, so is the former.</p>
<p>OBS. 23.--The relatives <i>that</i> and <i>as</i> have this peculiarity; that, unlike <i>whom</i> and <i>which</i>, they never follow the word on which their case depends; nor indeed can any simple relative be so placed, except it be governed by a preposition or an infinitive. Thus, it is said, (John, xiii, 29th,) "Buy those things <i>that</i> we have need <i>of</i>;" so we may say, "Buy such things <i>as</i> we have need of." But we cannot say, "Buy those things <i>of that</i> we have need;" or, "Buy such things <i>of as</i> we have need." Though we may say, "Buy those things <i>of which</i> we have need," as well as, "Buy those things <i>which</i> we have need <i>of</i>;" or, "Admit those persons of whom we have need," as well as, "Admit those persons <i>whom</i> we have need <i>of.</i>" By this it appears that <i>that</i> and <i>as</i> have a closer connexion with their antecedents than the other relatives require: a circumstance worthy to have been better remembered by some critics. "Again, <i>that</i> and <i>as</i> are used rather differently. When <i>that</i> is used, the verb must be repeated; as, 'Participles <i>require</i> the same government, <i>that</i> their verbs <i>require</i>.'--'James <i>showed</i> the same credulity, <i>that</i> his minister <i>showed</i>.' But when <i>as</i> is used, the verb generally may, or may not be repeated; as, 'Participles <i>require</i> the same government <i>as</i> their verbs;' or, '<i>as</i> their verbs <i>require</i>.'--'James <i>showed</i> the same credulity as his minister;' or, '<i>as</i> his minister <i>showed</i>:' the second nominative <i>minister</i> being parsed as the nominative to the same verb <i>showed</i> understood."--<i>Nixon's Parser</i>, p. 140.[195]</p>
<p>OBS. 24.--The terminating of a sentence with a preposition, or other small particle, is in general undignified, though perhaps not otherwise improper. Hence the above-named inflexibility in the construction of <i>that</i> and <i>as</i>, sometimes induces an ellipsis of the governing word designed; and is occasionally attended with some difficulty respecting the choice of our terms. Examples: "The answer is always in the same case <i>that</i> the interrogative word <i>is</i>."--<i>Sanborn's Gram.</i>, p. 70. Here is a faulty termination; and with it a more faulty ellipsis. In stead of ending the sentence with <i>is in</i>, say, "The answer always <i>agrees in case with</i> the interrogative word." Again: "The relative is of the same person <i>with</i> the antecedent."--<i>Lowth's Gram.</i>, p. 101. This sentence is wrong, because the person of the relative is not really <i>identical with</i> the antecedent. "The relative is of the same person <i>as</i> the antecedent."--<i>Murray's Gram.</i>, p. 154. Here the writer means--"<i>as</i> the antecedent <i>is of</i>." "A neuter verb becomes active, when followed by a noun of the same signification <i>with</i> its own."--<i>Sanborn's Gram.</i>, p. 127. Here same is wrong, or else the last three words are useless. It would therefore be improper to say--"of <i>the</i> same <i>signification</i> as <i>its own." The expression ought to be--"of a</i> signification <i>similar to</i> its own." "Ode is, <i>in Greek</i>, the same <i>with</i> song or hymn."--<i>Blair's Rhet.</i>, p. 396. <i>Song</i> being no Greek word, I cannot think the foregoing expression accurate, though one might say, "Ode is <i>identical with</i> song or hymn." Would it not be better to say, "Ode is the same <i>as</i> song or hymn?" That is, "Ode is, <i>literally</i>, the same <i>thing</i> that <i>song or hymn</i> is<i>?" "Treatises of philosophy, ought not to be</i> composed in the same style <i>with</i> orations."--<i>Blair's Rhet.</i>, p. 175. Here neither <i>with</i> nor <i>as</i> can be proper; because <i>orations</i> are not <i>a</i> style<i>. Expunge</i> same<i>; and say--"in the style</i> of <i>orations."</i></p>
<p>OBS. 25.--Few writers are sufficiently careful in their choice and management of relatives. In the following instance, Murray and others violate a special rule of their own grammars, by using <i>whom</i> for <i>that</i> "after an adjective of the superlative degree:" "Modifying them according to the genius of that tongue, and the established practice of <i>the best</i> speakers and writers <i>by whom</i> it is used."--<i>Octavo Gram.</i>, p. 1; <i>Fisk's</i>, p. 11; <i>et al.</i> According to Priestley and himself, the great Compiler is here in an error. The rule is perhaps too stringent; but whoever teaches it, should keep it. If he did not like to say, "<i>the best</i> speakers and writers <i>that</i> it is used <i>by</i>;" he ought to have said, "<i>the</i> best <i>speakers and writers</i> that use it<i>." Or, rather, he ought to have</i> said <i>nothing</i> after the word "writers;" because the whole relative clause is here weak and useless. Yet how many of the amenders of this grammar have not had perspicacity enough, either to omit the expression, or to correct it according to the author's own rule!</p>
<p>OBS. 26.--Relative pronouns are capable of being taken in two very different senses: the one, restrictive of the general idea suggested by the antecedent; the other, <i>resumptive</i> of that idea, in the full import of the term--or, in whatever extent the previous definitives allow. The distinction between these two senses, important as it is, is frequently made to depend solely upon the insertion or the omission of <i>a comma</i>. Thus, if I say, "Men who grasp after riches, are never satisfied;" the relative <i>who</i> is taken restrictively, and I am understood to speak <i>only</i> of the avaricious<i>. But, if I say, "Men, who grasp after riches, are never</i> satisfied;" by separating the terms <i>men</i> and <i>who</i>, I declare <i>all men</i> to be covetous and unsatisfied. For the former sense, the relative <i>that</i> is preferable to <i>who</i>; and I shall presently show why. This example, in the latter form, is found in Sanborn's Grammar, page 142d; but whether the author meant what he says, or not, I doubt. Like many other unskillful writers, he has paid little regard to the above-mentioned distinction; and, in some instances, his meaning cannot have been what his words declare: as, "A prism is a solid, whose sides are all parallelograms."--<i>Analytical</i> Gram.<i>, p. 142. This, as it stands, is no definition of a prism, but an</i> assertion of two things; that a prism is a solid, and that all the sides of a solid are parallelograms. Erase the comma, and the words will describe the prism as a peculiar kind of solid; because <i>whose</i> will then be taken in the restrictive sense. This sense, however, may be conveyed even with a comma before the relative; as, "Some fictitious histories yet remain, <i>that</i> were composed during the decline of the Roman empire."--<i>Blair's</i> Rhet.<i>, p. 374. This does not suggest that there are no other fictitious</i> histories now extant, than such as were composed during the decline of the Roman empire; but I submit it to the reader, whether the word <i>which</i>, if here put for <i>that</i>, would not convey this idea.</p>
<p>OBS. 27.--Upon this point, many philologists are open to criticism; and none more so, than the recent author above cited. By his own plain showing, this grammarian has no conception of the difference of meaning, upon which the foregoing distinction is founded. What marvel, then, that he falls into errors, both of doctrine and of practice? But, if no such difference exists, or none that is worthy of a critic's notice; then the error is mine, and it is vain to distinguish between the restrictive and the resumptive sense of relative pronouns. For example: "The boy that desires to assist his companions, deserves respect."--<i>G. Brown.</i> "That boy, who desires to assist his companions, deserves respect."--<i>D. H. Sanborn.</i> According to my notion, these two sentences clearly convey two very different meanings; the relative, in the former, being restrictive, but, in the latter, resumptive of the sense of the antecedent. But of the latter example this author says, "The clause, 'who desires to assist his companions,' with the relative who at its head, <i>explains or tells what boy</i> deserves respect<i>; and, like a conjunction, connects this clause to the</i> noun <i>boy</i>."--<i>Analytical Gram.</i>, p. 69. He therefore takes it in a restrictive sense, as if this sentence were exactly equivalent to the former. But he adds, "A relative pronoun is resolvable into a personal pronoun and a conjunction. The sentence would then read, 'That boy desires to assist his companions, <i>and</i> he deserves respect.' The relative pronoun governs the nearer verb, and the antecedent the more distant one."--<i>Ib.</i>, p. 69. Now, concerning the restrictive relative, this doctrine of equivalence does not hold good; and, besides, the explanation here given, not only contradicts his former declaration of the sense he intended, but, with other seeming contradiction, joins the antecedent to the nearer verb, and the substituted pronoun to the more distant.</p>
<p>OBS. 28.--Again, the following principles of this author's punctuation are no less indicative of his false views of this matter: "RULE xiv.--Relative pronouns in the nominative or [<i>the</i>] objective case, are preceded by commas, when the clause which the relative <i>connects</i> [,] ends a sentence; as, 'Sweetness of temper is a quality, which reflects a lustre on every accomplishment'--B. Greenleaf.' Self [-] denial is the sacrifice [,] which virtue must make.' [<i>--L. Murray.</i>] The comma is omitted before the relative, when the verb which the antecedent governs, follows the relative clause; as, 'He that suffers by imposture, has too often his virtue more impaired than his fortune.'--<i>Johnson</i>." See <i>Sanborn's Analytical Gram.</i>, p. 269. Such are some of our author's principles--"the essence of modern improvements." His practice, though often wrong, is none the worse for contradicting these doctrines. Nay, his proudest boast is ungrammatical, though peradventure not the less believed: "<i>No</i> [other] <i>grammar in the</i> language <i>probably contains so great a quantity of</i> condensed and <i>useful</i> matter with so little superfluity."--<i>Sanborn's Preface</i>, p. v.</p>
<p>OBS. 29.--Murray's rule for the punctuation of relatives, (a rule which he chiefly copied from Lowth,) recognizes virtually the distinction which I have made above; but, in assuming that relatives "<i>generally</i>" require a comma before them, it erroneously suggests that the resumptive sense is more common than the restrictive. Churchill, on the contrary, as wrongly makes it an essential characteristic of <i>all</i> relatives, "to limit or explain the words to which they refer." See his <i>New Gram.</i>, p. 74. The fact is, that relatives are so generally restrictive, that not one half of them are thus pointed; though some that do restrict their antecedent, nevertheless admit the point. This may be seen by the first example given us by Murray: "Relative pronouns are connective words, and <i>generally</i> admit <i>a comma before them: as, 'He preaches sublimely, who lives a sober,</i> righteous, and pious life.' But when two members, or <i>phrases</i>, [say <i>clauses</i>,] are closely connected by a relative, restraining the general notion of the antecedent to a particular sense, <i>the comma should be</i> omitted<i>: as, <b>Self-denial</b></i> <b>is the <i>sacrifice which</i> virtue must make;' 'A</b> <i>man who</i> is of a detracting spirit, will misconstrue the most innocent <i>words that</i> can be put together.' In the latter example, the assertion is not of 'a man in general,' but of 'a man who is of a detracting spirit;' and therefore <i>they</i> [say <i>the pronoun and its antecedent</i>] should not be separated."--<i>Murray's Gram., Octavo</i>, p. 273; <i>Ingersoll's</i>, 285; <i>Comly's</i>, 152. This reasoning, strictly applied, would exclude the comma before <i>who</i> in the first example above; but, as the pronoun does not "closely" or immediately follow its antecedent, the comma is allowed, though it is not much needed. Not so, when the sense is resumptive: as, "The <i>additions, which</i> are very considerable, are chiefly <i>such as</i> are calculated to obviate objections." See <i>Murray's Gram.</i>, p. ix. Here the comma is essential to the meaning. Without it, <i>which</i> would be equivalent to <i>that</i>; with it, which is equivalent to <i>and they</i>. But this latter meaning, as I imagine, cannot be expressed by the relative <i>that</i>.</p>
<p>OBS. 30.--Into the unfortunate example which Sanborn took from Murray, I have inserted the comma for him; not because it is necessary or right, but because his rule requires it: "<i>Self-denial</i> is the <i>sacrifice</i>," &amp;c. The author of "a complete system of grammar," might better contradict even Murray, than himself. But why was this text admired? and why have <i>Greene,</i> Bullions, Hiley, Hart<i>, and others, also copied it? A</i> sacrifice <i>is</i> something devoted and lost, for the sake of a greater good; and, <i>if Virtue</i> sacrifice self-denial<i>, what will she do, but run into indulgence? The</i> great sacrifice which she demands of men, is rather that of their <i>self-love</i>. Wm. E. Russell has it, "<i>Self defence</i> is the sacrifice which virtue must make!"--<i>Russell's Abridgement of Murray's Gram.</i>, p. 116. Bishop Butler tells us, "It is indeed <i>ridiculous</i> to assert, that <i>self-denial is essential to virtue and piety</i>; but it would have been nearer the truth, though not strictly the truth itself, to have said, that it is essential to discipline and improvement."--<i>Analogy of Religion</i>, p. 123.</p>
<p>OBS. 31.--The relative <i>that</i>, though usually reckoned equivalent to <i>who</i> or <i>which</i>, evidently differs from both, in being more generally, and perhaps more appropriately, taken in the restrictive sense. It ought therefore, for distinction's sake, to be preferred to <i>who</i> or <i>which</i>, whenever an antecedent not otherwise limited, is to be restricted by the relative clause; as, "<i>Men that</i> grasp after riches, are never satisfied."--"I love <i>wisdom that</i> is gay and civilized."--<i>Art of</i> Thinking<i>, p. 34. This phraseology leaves not the limitation of the meaning</i> to depend solely upon the absence of a pause after the antecedent; because the relative <i>that</i> is seldom, if ever, used by good writers in any other than a restrictive sense. Again: "A man of a polite imagination is let into a great many pleasures <i>that</i> the vulgar are not capable of receiving."--<i>Addison, Spect.</i>, No. 411. Here, too, according to my notion, <i>that</i> is obviously preferable to <i>which</i>; though a great critic, very widely known, has taken some pains to establish a different opinion. The "many pleasures" here spoken of, are no otherwise defined, than as being such as "the vulgar are not capable of receiving." The writer did not mean to deny that the vulgar are capable of receiving a great many pleasures; but, certainly, if <i>that</i> were changed to <i>which</i>, this would be the meaning conveyed, unless the reader were very careful to avoid a pause where he would be apt to make one. I therefore prefer Addison's expression to that which Dr. Blair would substitute.</p>
<p>OBS. 32.--The style of Addison is more than once censured by Dr. Blair, for the frequency with which the relative <i>that</i> occurs in it, where the learned lecturer would have used which. The reasons assigned by the critic are these: "<i>Which</i> is a much more definitive word than that, being never employed in any other way than as a relative; whereas <i>that</i> is a word of many senses; sometimes a demonstrative pronoun, often a conjunction. In some cases we are indeed obliged to use <i>that</i> for a relative, in order to avoid the ungraceful repetition of <i>which</i> in the same sentence. But when we are laid under no necessity of this kind, <i>which</i> is always the preferable word, and certainly was so in this sentence: '<i>Pleasures which</i> the vulgar are not capable of receiving,' is much better than <b>pleasures</b> that <i>the vulgar are not capable of receiving.'"--</i>Blair's Rhetoric<i>, Lect.</i> xx, p. 200. Now the facts are these: (1.) That <i>that</i> is the more definitive or restrictive word of the two. (2.) That the word <i>which</i> has as many different senses and uses as the word <i>that</i>. (3.) That not the repetition of <i>which</i> or <i>who</i> in a series of clauses, but a <i>needless</i> change <i>of the relative, is ungraceful. (4.) That the necessity of using</i> <i>that</i> rather than <i>which</i> or <i>who</i>, depends, not upon what is here supposed, but upon the different senses which these words usually convey. (5.) That as there is always some reason of choice, <i>that</i> is sometimes to be preferred; <i>which</i>, sometimes; and <i>who</i>, sometimes: as, "It is not the man <i>who</i> has merely taught, or <i>who</i> has taught long, or <i>who</i> is able to point out defects in authors, <i>that</i> is capable of enlightening the world in the respective sciences <i>which</i> have engaged his attention; but the man <i>who</i> has taught well."--<i>Kirkham's Elocution</i>, p. 7.</p>
<p>OBS. 33.--Blair's Rhetoric consists of forty-seven lectures; four of which are devoted to a critical examination of the style of Addison, as exhibited in four successive papers of the Spectator. The remarks of the professor are in general judicious; but, seeing his work is made a common textbook for students of "Belles Lettres," it is a pity to find it so liable to reprehension on the score of inaccuracy. Among the passages which are criticised in the twenty-first lecture, there is one in which the essayist speaks of the effects of <i>novelty</i> as follows:</p>
<p>'It is this <i>which</i> bestows charms on a monster, and makes even the imperfections of nature please us. It is this <i>that</i> recommends variety, where the mind is every instant called off to something new, and the attention not suffered to dwell too long and waste itself on any particular object. It is this, likewise, <i>that</i> improves what is great or beautiful, and makes it afford the mind a double entertainment.'--<i>Spectator</i>, No. 412.</p>
<p>This passage is deservedly praised by the critic, for its "perspicuity, grace, and harmony;" but, in using different relatives under like circumstances, the writer has hardly done justice to his own good taste. Blair's remark is this: "His frequent use of <i>that</i>, instead of <i>which</i>, is another peculiarity of his style; but, on this occasion in particular, [it] cannot be much commended, as, 'It is this <i>which</i>,' seems, in every view, to be better than, 'It is this <i>that</i>,' three times repeated."--<i>Lect.</i> xxi, p. 207. What is here meant by "<i>every view</i>," may, I suppose, be seen in the corresponding criticism which is noticed in my last observation above; and I am greatly deceived, if, in this instance also, the relative <i>that</i> is not better than <i>which</i>, and more agreeable to polite usage. The direct relative which corresponds to the introductory pronoun <i>it</i> and <i>an</i> other antecedent<i>, should, I think, be</i> that<i>, and not</i> who <i>or</i> which<i>:</i> as, "It is not ye <i>that</i> speak."--<i>Matt.</i>, x, 20. "It is thou, Lord, <i>who</i> hast the hearts of all men in thy hands, <i>that</i> turnest the hearts of any to show me favour."--<i>Jenks's Prayers</i>, p. 278. Here <i>who</i> has reference to <i>thou</i> or <i>Lord</i> only; but <i>that</i> has some respect to the pronoun <i>it</i>, though it agrees in person and gender with <i>thou</i>. A similar example is cited at the close of the preceding observation; and I submit it to the reader, whether the word <i>that</i>, as it there occurs, is not the <i>only fit</i> word for the place it occupies. So in the following examples: "There are <i>Words, which</i> are <i>not Verbs, that</i> signify actions and passions, and even things transient."--<i>Brightland's Gram.</i>, p. 100. "It is the universal taste of mankind, which is subject to no such changing modes, <i>that</i> alone is entitled to possess any authority."--<i>Blair's Rhetoric</i>, p. 286.</p>
<p>OBS. 34.--Sometimes the broad import of an antecedent is <i>doubly</i> restricted<i>, first by one relative clause, and then by an other; as, "And</i> all <i>that dwell upon the earth</i>, shall worship him, <i>whose names are not</i> written in the book of life<i>."--</i>Rev.<i>, xiii, 8. "And then, like true</i> Thames-Watermen, they abuse every man <i>that</i> passes by, <i>who</i> is better dressed than themselves."--<i>Brown's Estimate</i>, Vol. ii, p. 10. Here <i>and</i>, or <i>if he</i>, would be as good as "<i>who</i>;" for the connective only serves to carry the restriction into narrower limits. Sometimes the limit fixed by one clause is <i>extended</i> by an other; as, "There is no evil <i>that you may</i> suffer<i>, or</i> that you may expect to suffer, which <i>prayer is not the</i> appointed means to alleviate."--<i>Bickersteth, on Prayer</i>, p. 16. Here <i>which</i> resumes the idea of "<i>evil</i>," in the extent last determined; or rather, in that which is fixed by either clause, since the limits of both are embraced in the assertion. And, in the two limiting clauses, the same pronoun was requisite, on account of their joint relation; but the clause which assumes a different relation, is rightly introduced by a different pronoun. This is also the case in the following examples: "For there is no condemnation to those <i>that</i> are in Christ Jesus, <i>who</i> walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit."--<i>Barclay's Works</i>, Vol. i, p. 432. "I will tell thee the mystery of the woman, and of the beast <i>that</i> carrieth her, <i>which</i> hath the seven heads and ten horns."--<i>Rev.</i>, xvii, 7. Here the restrictive sense is well expressed by one relative, and the resumptive by an other. When neither of these senses is intended by the writer, <i>any</i> form of the relative must needs be improper: as, "The greatest genius <i>which runs</i> through the arts and sciences, takes a kind of tincture from them, and falls unavoidably into imitation."--<i>Addison, Spect.</i>, No. 160. Here, as I suppose, <i>which runs</i> should be <i>in running</i>. What else can the author have meant?</p>
<p>OBS. 35.--Having now, as I imagine, clearly shown the difference between the restrictive and the resumptive sense of a relative pronoun, and the absolute necessity of making such a choice of words as will express that sense only which we intend; I hope the learner will see, by these observations, not merely that clearness requires the occasional use of each of our five relatives, <i>who, which, what, that</i>, and <i>as</i>; but that this distinction in the meaning, is a very common principle by which to determine what is, and what is not, good English. Thus <i>that</i> and <i>as</i> are appropriately our <i>restrictive</i> relatives, though <i>who</i> and <i>which</i> are sometimes used restrictively; but, in a <i>resumptive</i> sense, <i>who</i> or <i>which</i> is required, and required even after those terms which usually demand <i>that</i> or <i>as</i>: thus, "We are vexed at the unlucky chance, and go away dissatisfied. <i>Such</i> impressions, <i>which</i> ought not to be cherished, are a sufficient reason for excluding stories of that kind from the theatre."--<i>Kames, El. of Crit.</i>, ii, 279. Here <i>which</i> is proper to the sense intended; but <i>such</i> requires <i>as</i>, when the latter term limits the meaning of the former. In sentences like the following, <i>who</i> or <i>which</i> may be used in lieu of <i>that</i>; whether with any advantage or not, the reader may judge: "You seize the critical moment <i>that</i> is favorable to emotion."--<i>Bair's Rhet.</i>, p. 321. "<i>An</i> historian <i>that</i> would instruct us, must know when to be concise."--<i>Ib.</i>, p. 359. "Seneca has been censured for the affectation <i>that</i> appears in his style."--<i>Ib.</i>, p. 367. "Such as the prodigies <i>that</i> attended the death of Julius Cæsar."--<i>Ib.</i>, p. 401. "By unfolding those principles <i>that</i> ought to govern the taste of every individual."--<i>Kames's Dedication to El. of Crit.</i> "But I am sure he has that <i>that</i> is better than an estate."--<i>Spect.</i>, No. 475. "There are two properties, <i>that</i> characterize and essentially distinguish relative pronouns."--<i>Churchill's Gram.</i>, p. 74. By these examples, it may be seen, that Dr. Blair often forgot or disregarded his own doctrine respecting the use of this relative; though he was oftener led, by the error of that doctrine, to substitute <i>which</i> for <i>that</i> improperly.</p>
<p>OBS. 36.--<i>Whether</i> was formerly used as an interrogative pronoun, in which sense it always referred to one of two things; as, "Ye fools and blind! for <i>whether</i> is greater, the gold, or the temple that sanctifieth the gold?"--<i>Matt.</i>, xxiii, 17. This usage is now obsolete; and, in stead of it, we say, "<i>Which</i> is greater?" But as a disjunctive conjunction, corresponding to <i>or</i>, the word <i>whether</i> is still in good repute; as, "Resolve <i>whether</i> you will go <i>or</i> not."--<i>Webster's Dict.</i> In this sense of the term, some choose to call <i>whether</i> an <i>adverb</i>.</p>
<p>OBS. 37.--In the view of some writers, interrogative pronouns differ from relatives chiefly in this; that, as the subject referred to is unknown to the speaker, they do not relate to a <i>preceding</i> noun, but to something which is to be expressed in the answer to the question. It is certain that their <i>person, number</i>, and <i>gender</i>, are not regulated by an antecedent noun; but by what the speaker supposes or knows of a subject which may, or may not, agree with them in these respects: as, "<i>What</i> lies there?" Answer, "Two <i>men</i> asleep." Here <i>what</i>, standing for <i>what thing</i>, is of the third person, singular number, and neuter gender; but <i>men</i>, which is the term that answers to it, is of the third person, plural, masculine. There is therefore no necessary agreement between the question and the answer, in any of those properties in which a pronoun usually agrees with its noun. Yet some grammarians will have interrogatives to agree with these "<i>subsequents</i>," as relatives agree with their <i>antecedents</i>. The answer, it must be granted, commonly contains a noun, corresponding in some respects to the interrogative pronoun, and agreeing with it <i>in case</i>; but this noun cannot be supposed to control the interrogation, nor is it, in any sense, the word for which the pronoun stands. For every pronoun must needs stand for something that is uttered or conceived by the same speaker; nor can any question be answered, until its meaning is understood. Interrogative pronouns must therefore be explained as direct substitutes for such other terms as one might use in stead of them. Thus <i>who</i> means <i>what person</i>?</p>
<pre>  "<i>Who</i> taught that heav'n-directed spire to rise?
   <i>The Man of Ross</i>, each lisping babe replies."--<i>Pope</i>.
</pre>
<p>OBS. 38.--In the classification of the pronouns, and indeed in the whole treatment of them, almost all our English grammars are miserably faulty, as well as greatly at variance. In some forty or fifty, which I have examined on this point, the few words which constitute this part of speech, have more than twenty different modes of distribution. (1.) Cardell says, "There is but one kind of pronouns"--<i>Elements of Gram.</i>, p. 30. (2.) D. Adam's, Greenleaf, Nutting, and Weld, will have two kinds; "<i>personal</i> and <i>relative</i>." (3.) Dr. Webster's "Substitutes, or pronouns, are of two kinds:" the one, "called <i>personal</i>;" the other, without name or number. See his <i>Improved Gram.</i>, p. 24. (4.) Many have fixed upon three sorts; "<i>personal, relative</i>, and <i>adjective</i>;" with a subdivision of the last. Of these is Lindley Murray, in his late editions, with his amenders, Ainsworth, Alger, Bacon, Bullions, Fisk, A. Flint, Frost, Guy, Hall, Kirkham, Lennie, Merchant, Picket, Pond, and S. Putnam. (5.) Kirkham, however, changes the order of the classes; thus, "<i>personal, adjective</i>, and <i>relative</i>;" and, with ridiculous absurdity, makes <i>mine, thine, hers,</i> ours, yours<i>, and</i> theirs <i>to be "</i>compounds<i>." (6.) Churchill adopts the</i> plan of "<i>personal, relative</i>, and <i>adjective</i> pronouns;" and then destroys it by a valid argument. (7.) Comly, Wilcox, Wells, and Perley, have these three classes; "<i>personal, relative</i>, and <i>interrogative</i>:" and this division is right. (8.) Sanborn makes the following bull: "The <i>general</i> divisions of pronouns are <i>into personal, relative, interrogative</i>, and <i>several sub-divisions</i>."--<i>Analytical Gram.</i>, p. 91. (9.) Jaudon has these three kinds; "<i>personal, relative</i>, and <i>distributive</i>." (10.) Robbins, these; "<i>simple, conjunctive</i>, and <i>interrogative</i>." (11.) Lindley Murray, in his early editions, had these four; "<i>personal, possessive, relative</i>, and <i>adjective</i>." (12.) Bucke has these; "<i>personal, relative,</i> interrogative<i>, and</i> adjective<i>." (13.) Ingersoll, these; "</i>personal, adjective, relative<i>, and</i> interrogative<i>." (14.) Buchanan; "</i>personal, demonstrative, relative<i>, and</i> interrogative<i>." (15.) Coar; "</i>personal, possessive <i>or</i> pronominal adjectives, demonstrative<i>, and</i> relative<i>."</i> (16.) Bicknell; "<i>personal, possessive, relative</i>, and <i>demonstrative</i>." (17.) Cobbett; "<i>personal, relative, demonstrative</i>, and <i>indefinite</i>." (18) M'Culloch; "<i>personal, possessive, relative</i>, and <i>reciprocal</i>." (19.) Staniford has five; "<i>personal, relative, interrogative, definitive</i>, and <i>distributive</i>." (20.) Alexander, six; "<i>personal, relative, demonstrative,</i> interrogative, definitive<i>, and</i> adjective<i>." (21.) Cooper, in 1828, had</i> five; "<i>personal, relative, possessive, definite</i>, and <i>indefinite</i>." (22.) Cooper, in 1831, six; "<i>personal, relative, definite, indefinite,</i> possessive<i>, and</i> possessive pronominal adjectives<i>." (23.) Dr. Crombie</i> says: "Pronouns may be divided into <i>Substantive</i>, and <i>Adjective;</i> Personal<i>, and</i> Impersonal; Relative<i>, and</i> Interrogative<i>." (24.) Alden</i> has seven sorts; "<i>personal, possessive, relative, interrogative,</i> distributive, demonstrative<i>, and</i> indefinite<i>." (25.) R. C. Smith has many</i> kinds, and treats them so badly that nobody can count them. In respect to definitions, too, most of these writers are shamefully inaccurate, or deficient. Hence the filling up of their classes is often as bad as the arrangement. For instance, four and twenty of them will have interrogative pronouns to be relatives; but who that knows what a relative pronoun is, can coincide with them in opinion? Dr. Crombie thinks, "that interrogatives are strictly relatives;" and yet divides the two classes with his own hand!</p>
<p><br>
MODIFICATIONS.</p>
<p>Pronouns have the same modifications as nouns; namely, <i>Persons, Numbers,</i> Genders<i>, and</i> Cases<i>. Definitions universally applicable have already been</i> given of all these things; it is therefore unnecessary to define them again in this place.</p>
<p><br>
OBSERVATIONS.</p>
<p>OBS. 1.--In the personal pronouns, most of these properties are distinguished by the words themselves; in the relative and the interrogative pronouns, they are ascertained chiefly by means of the antecedent and the verb. Interrogative pronouns, however, as well as the relatives <i>which, what, as</i>, and all the compounds of <i>who, which</i>, and <i>what</i>, are always of the third person. Even in etymological parsing, some regard must be had to the syntactical relations of words. By <i>modifications</i>, we commonly mean actual changes in the forms of words, by which their grammatical properties are inherently distinguished; but, in all languages, the distinguishable properties of words are somewhat more numerous than their actual variations of form; there being certain principles of universal grammar, which cause the person, number, gender, or case, of some words, to be inferred from their relation to others; or, what is nearly the same thing, from the sense which is conveyed by the sentence. Hence, if in a particular instance it happen, that some, or even all, of these properties, are without any index in the form of the pronoun itself, they are still to be ascribed in parsing, because they may be easily and certainly discovered from the construction. For example: in the following text, it is just as easy to discern the <i>genders</i> of the pronouns, as the <i>cases</i> of the nouns; and both are known and asserted to be what they are, upon principles of mere inference: "For what knowest <i>thou</i>, O <i>wife</i>, whether <i>thou</i> shalt save <i>thy husband</i>? or how knowest <i>thou</i>, O <i>man</i>, whether <i>thou</i> shalt save <i>thy wife</i>?"--<i>1 Cor.</i>, vii, 16. Again: "<i>Who</i> betrayed <i>her</i> companion? Not <i>I</i>."--<i>Murray's Key</i>, p. 211. Here <i>her</i> being of the feminine gender, it is the inference of every reader, that <i>who</i> and <i>I</i> are so too; but whether the word <i>companion</i> is masculine or feminine, is not so obvious.</p>
<p>OBS. 2.--The personal pronouns of the first and second persons, are equally applicable to both sexes; and should be considered masculine or feminine, according to the known application of them. [See <i>Levizac's French Gram.</i>, p. 73.] The speaker and the hearer, being present to each other, of course know the sex to which they respectively belong; and, whenever they appear in narrative or dialogue, we are told who they are. In <i>Latin</i>, an adjective or a participle relating to these pronouns, is varied <i>to agree</i> with them in <i>number, gender</i>, and <i>case</i>. This is a sufficient proof that <i>ego, I</i>, and <i>tu, thou</i>, are not destitute of gender, though neither the Latin words nor the English are themselves varied to express it:--</p>
<pre>         "<i>Miseræ</i> hoc tamen unum
   Exequere, Anna, <i>mihi: solam</i> nam perfidus ille
   <i>Te</i> colere, arcanos etiam tibi credere sensus;
   <i>Sola</i> viri molles aditus et tempora nôras."--<i>Virgil</i>.
</pre>
<p>OBS. 3.--Many English grammarians, and Murray at their head, deny the first person of nouns, and the gender of pronouns of the first and second persons; and at the same time teach, that, "Pronouns must always agree with their antecedents, <i>and</i> the nouns for which they stand, in <i>gender,</i> number<i>, and</i> person<i>:" (</i>Murray's Gr., 2d Ed.<i>, p. 111;</i> Rev. T. Smith's<i>,</i> p. 60:) and further, with redundance of expression, that, "The relative is of the same person <i>with</i> the antecedent, and the verb agrees with it accordingly."--<i>Same</i>. These quotations form Murray's fifth rule of syntax, as it stands in his early editions.[196] In some of his revisings, the author erased the word <i>person</i> from the former sentence, and changed <i>with</i> to <i>as</i> in the latter. But other pronouns than relatives, agree with their nouns in person; so that his first alteration was not for the better, though Ingersoll, Kirkham, Alger, Bacon, J. Greenleaf, and some others, have been very careful to follow him in it. And why did he never discern, that the above-named principles of his etymology are both of them contradicted by this rule of his syntax, and one of them by his rule as it now stands? It is manifest, that no two words can possibly <i>agree</i> in any property which belongs not to both. Else what <i>is</i> agreement? Nay, no two things in nature, can in any wise agree, accord, or be alike, but by having some quality or accident in common. How strange a contradiction then is this! And what a compliment to learning, that it is still found in well-nigh all our grammars!</p>
<p>OBS. 4.--If there were truth in what Murray and others affirm, that "Gender has respect only to the third person singular of the pronouns, <i>he, she,</i> it<i>," [197] no two words could ever agree in gender; because there can be</i> no such agreement between any two of the words here mentioned, and the assertion is, that gender has respect to no others. But, admitting that neither the author nor the numerous copiers of this false sentence ever meant to deny that gender has respect to <i>nouns</i>, they do deny that it has respect to any other <i>pronouns</i> than these; whereas I affirm that it ought to be recognized as a property of <i>all</i> pronouns, as well as of all nouns. Not that the gender of either is in all instances invariably fixed by the <i>forms</i> of the particular words; but there is in general, if not in every possible case, some principle of grammar, on which the gender of any noun or pronoun in a sentence may be readily ascertained. Is it not plain, that if we know who speaks or writes, who hears or is addressed, we know also the gender of the pronouns which are applied to these persons? The poet of The Task looked upon his mother's picture, and expressed his tender recollections of a deceased parent by way of <i>address</i>; and will any one pretend, that the pronouns which he applied to himself and to her, are either of the same gender, or of no gender? If we take neither of these assumptions, must we not say, they are of different genders? In this instance, then, let the parser call those of the first person, masculine; and those of the second, feminine:--</p>
<pre>  "<i>My</i> mother! when <i>I</i> learned that <i>thou</i> wast dead,
   Say, wast <i>thou</i> conscious of the tears <i>I</i> shed?"--<i>Cowper</i>.
</pre>
<p>OBS. 5.--That the pronouns of the first and second persons are sometimes masculine and sometimes feminine, is perfectly certain; but whether they can or cannot be neuter, is a question difficult to be decided. To things inanimate they are applied only <i>figuratively</i>; and the question is, whether the figure always necessarily changes the gender of the antecedent noun. We assume the general principle, that the noun and its pronoun are always of the same gender; and we know that when inanimate objects are personified in the third person, they are usually represented as masculine or feminine, the gender being changed by the figure. But when a lifeless object is spoken to in the second person, or represented as speaking in the first, as the pronouns here employed are in themselves without distinction of gender, no such change can be proved by the mere words; and, if we allow that it would be needless to <i>imagine</i> it where the words do not prove it, the gender of these pronouns must in such cases be neuter, because we have no ground to think it otherwise. Examples: "And Jesus answered and said unto <i>it</i>, [the barren <i>figtree</i>,] No man eat fruit of <i>thee</i> hereafter forever."--<i>Mark</i>, xi, 14. "O <i>earth</i>, cover not <i>thou</i> my blood."--<i>Job</i>, xvi, 18. "O <i>thou sword</i> of the Lord, how long will it be ere <i>thou</i> be quiet?"--<i>Jeremiah</i>, xlvii, 6. In these instances, the objects addressed do not appear to be figuratively invested with the attribute of sex. So likewise with respect to the first person. If, in the following example, <i>gold</i> and <i>diamond</i> are neuter, so is the pronoun <i>me</i>; and, if not neuter, of what gender are they? The personification indicates or discriminates no other.</p>
<pre>  "Where thy true treasure? Gold says, 'Not in <i>me</i>;
   And, 'Not in <i>me</i>,' the diamond. Gold is poor."--<i>Young</i>.

THE DECLENSION OF PRONOUNS.</p>
<p>The declension of a pronoun is a regular arrangement of its numbers and cases.</p>
<p>I. SIMPLE PERSONALS.</p>
<p>The simple personal pronouns are thus declined:--</p>
<p>I, <i>of the</i> FIRST PERSON, <i>any of the genders</i>.[198]</p>
<p>Sing. Nom. I, Plur. Nom. we,</p>
<pre>     Poss. my, <i>or</i> mine,[199]        Poss. our, <i>or</i> ours,
     Obj.  me;                        Obj.  us.
</pre>
<p>THOU, <i>of the</i> SECOND PERSON, <i>any of the genders</i>.</p>
<p>Sing. Nom. thou,[200] Plur. Nom. ye, or you,</p>
<pre>     Poss. thy, <i>or</i> thine,           Poss. your, <i>or</i> yours,
     Obj.  thee;                      Obj.  you, or ye.[201]
</pre>
<p>HE, <i>of the</i> THIRD PERSON, <i>masculine gender</i>.</p>
<p>Sing. Nom. he, Plur. Nom. they,</p>
<pre>     Poss. his,                       Poss. their, <i>or</i> theirs,
     Obj.  him;                       Obj.  them.
</pre>
<p>SHE, <i>of the</i> THIRD PERSON, <i>feminine gender</i>.</p>
<p>Sing. Nom. she, Plur. Nom. they,</p>
<pre>     Poss. her, <i>or</i> hers,            Poss. their, <i>or</i> theirs,
     Obj.  her;                       Obj.  them.
</pre>
<p>IT, <i>of the</i> THIRD PERSON, <i>neuter gender</i>.</p>
<p>Sing. Nom, it, Plur. Nom. they,</p>
<pre>     Poss. its,                       Poss. their, <i>or</i> theirs,
     Obj.  it;                        Obj.  them.
</pre>
<p>II. COMPOUND PERSONALS.</p>
<p>The word <i>self</i>, added to the simple personal pronouns, forms the class of <i>compound personal pronouns</i>; which are used when an action reverts upon the agent, and also when some persons are to be distinguished from others: as, sing, <i>myself</i>, plur. <i>ourselves</i>; sing, <i>thyself</i>, plur. <i>yourselves</i>; sing, <i>himself</i>, plur. <i>themselves</i>; sing, <i>herself</i>, plur. <i>themselves</i>; sing, <i>itself</i>, plur. <i>themselves</i>. They all want the possessive case, and are alike in the nominative and objective. Thus:--</p>
<p>MYSELF, <i>of the</i> FIRST PERSON,[202] <i>any of the genders</i>.</p>
<p>Sing. Nom. myself, Plur. Nom. ourselves,</p>
<pre>     Poss. ------,                    Poss. ---------,
     Obj.  myself;                    Obj.  ourselves.
</pre>
<p>THYSELF, <i>of the</i> SECOND PERSON, <i>any of the genders</i>.</p>
<p>Sing. Nom. thyself,[203] Plur. Nom. yourselves,</p>
<pre>     Poss. -------,                   Poss. ----------,
     Obj.  thyself;                   Obj.  yourselves.
</pre>
<p>HIMSELF, <i>of the</i> THIRD PERSON, <i>masculine gender</i>.</p>
<p>Sing. Nom. himself, Plur. Nom. themselves,</p>
<pre>     Poss. -------,                   Poss. ----------,
     Obj.   himself;                   Obj. themselves.
</pre>
<p>HERSELF, <i>of the</i> THIRD PERSON, <i>feminine gender</i>.</p>
<p>Sing. Nom. herself, Plur. Nom. themselves,</p>
<pre>     Poss. -------,                   Poss. ----------,
     Obj.  herself;                   Obj.  themselves.
</pre>
<p>ITSELF, <i>of the</i> THIRD PERSON, <i>neuter gender</i>.</p>
<p>Sing. Nom. itself, Plur. Nom. themselves,</p>
<pre>     Poss. ------,                    Poss. ----------,
     Obj.  itself;                    Obj.  themselves.
</pre>
<p><br>
III. RELATIVES AND INTERROGATIVES.</p>
<p>The relative and the interrogative pronouns are thus declined:--</p>
<p>WHO, <i>literally applied to persons only</i>.</p>
<p>Sing. Nom. who, Plur. Nom. who,</p>
<pre>     Poss. whose,                     Poss. whose,
     Obj.  whom;                      Obj.  whom.
</pre>
<p>WHICH, <i>applied to animals and things</i>.</p>
<p>Sing. Nom. which, Plur. Nom. which,</p>
<pre>     Poss. [204]--,                   Poss. -----,
     Obj.  which;                     Obj.  which.
</pre>
<p>WHAT, <i>applied ordinarily to things only</i>.[205]</p>
<p>Sing. Nom. what, Plur. Nom. what,</p>
<pre>     Poss. ----,                      Poss. ----,
     Obj.  what;                      Obj.  what.
</pre>
<p>THAT, <i>applied to persons, animals, and things</i>.</p>
<p>Sing. Nom. that, Plur. Nom. that,</p>
<pre>     Poss. ----,                      Poss. ----,
     Obj.  that;                      Obj.  that.
</pre>
<p>AS, <i>applied to persons, animals, and things</i>.</p>
<p>Sing. Nom. as, Plur. Nom. as,</p>
<pre>     Poss.    ----,                   Poss. ----,
     Obj.     as;                     Obj.  as.
</pre>
<p><br>
IV. COMPOUND RELATIVES.</p>
<p>The compound relative pronouns, <i>whoever</i> or <i>whosoever, whichever</i> or <i>whichsoever</i>, and <i>whatever</i> or <i>whatsoever</i>[206] are declined in the same manner as the simples, <i>who which, what</i>. Thus:--</p>
<p>WHOEVER or WHOSOEVER, <i>applied only to persons</i>.</p>
<p>Sing. Nom. whoever, Plur. Nom. whoever,</p>
<pre>     Poss. whosever,                  Poss. whosever,
     Obj.  whomever;                  Obj.  whomever.
</pre>
<p>Sing. Nom. whosoever, Plur. Nom. whosoever,</p>
<pre>     Poss. whosesoever,               Poss. whosesoever,
     Obj.  whomsoever;                Obj.  whomsoever.
</pre>
<p>WHICHEVER or WHICHSOEVER, <i>applied to persons, animals, and things</i>.</p>
<p>Sing. Nom. whichever, Plur. Nom. whichever,</p>
<pre>     Poss. ---------,                 Poss. --------,
     Obj.  whichever;                 Obj.  whichever.
</pre>
<p>Sing. Nom. whichsoever, Plur. Nom. whichsoever,</p>
<pre>     Poss. ---------,                 Poss. --------,
     Obj.  whichsoever;               Obj.  whichsoever.
</pre>
<p>WHATEVER or WHATSOEVER, <i>applied ordinarily to things only</i>.</p>
<p>Sing. Nom. whatever, Plur. Nom. whatever,</p>
<pre>     Poss. --------,                  Poss. --------,
     Obj.  whatever;                  Obj.  whatever.
</pre>
<p>Sing. Nom. whatsoever, Plur. Nom. whatsoever,</p>
<pre>     Poss. ---------,                 Poss. --------,
     Obj.  whatsoever;                Obj.  whatsoever.
</pre>
<p><br>
OBSERVATIONS.</p>
<p>OBS. 1.--Most of the personal pronouns have two forms of the possessive case, in each number: as, <i>my</i> or <i>mine, our</i> or <i>ours</i>; <i>thy</i> or <i>thine,</i> your <i>or</i> yours<i>;</i> her <i>or</i> hers, their <i>or</i> theirs<i>. The former is used</i> before a noun expressed, or when nothing but an adjective intervenes; the latter, when the governing noun is understood, or is so placed that a repetition of it is implied in or after the pronoun: as, "<i>My</i> powers are <i>thine</i>; be <i>thine</i> alone The glory of my song."--<i>Montgomery</i>. "State what <i>mine</i> and <i>your</i> principles are."--<i>Legh Richmond, to his Daughters</i>. Better, perhaps: "State what <i>my</i> principles and <i>yours</i> are;"--"State what <i>your</i> principles and <i>mine</i> are;"--or, "State what are <i>my</i> principles and <i>your own</i>."</p>
<pre>  "Resign'd he fell; superior to the dart
   That quench'd its rage in <i>yours</i> and <i>Britain's</i> heart."--<i>J. Brown</i>.
</pre>
<pre>   "Behold! to <i>yours</i> and <i>my</i> surprise,
   These trifles to a volume rise."--<i>Lloyd</i>, p. 186.
</pre>
<p>OBS. 2.--Possibly, when the same persons or things stand in a joint relation of this kind to different individuals or parties, it may be proper to connect two of the simple possessives to express it; though this construction can seldom, if ever, be necessary, because any such expression as <i>thy and her sister, my and his duty</i>, if not erroneous, can mean nothing but <i>your sister, our duty, &amp;c</i>. But some examples occur, the propriety of which it is worth while to consider: as, "I am sure it will be a pleasure to you to hear that she proves worthy of her father, worthy of you, and of <i>your and her</i> ancestors."--<i>Spectator</i>, No. 525. This sentence is from a version of Pliny's letter to his wife's aunt; and, as the ancestors of the two individuals are here the same, the phraseology may be allowable. But had the aunt commended her niece to Pliny, she should have said, "worthy of you and of <i>your</i> ancestors and <i>hers</i>." "Is it <i>her</i> or <i>his</i> honour that is tarnished? It is not <i>hers</i>, but <i>his</i>."--<i>Murray's</i> Gram.<i>, p. 175. This question I take to be bad English. It ought to be, "Is</i> it <i>her</i> honour or <i>his</i>, that is tarnished?" Her honour and his honour cannot be one and the same thing. This example was framed by Murray to illustrate that idle and puzzling distinction which he and some others make between "possessive adjective pronouns" and "the genitive case of the personal pronouns;" and, if I understand him, the author will here have <i>her</i> and <i>his</i> to be of the former class, and <i>hers</i> and <i>his</i> of the latter. It were a better use of time, to learn how to employ such words correctly. Unquestionably, they are of the same class and the same case, and would be every way equivalent, if the first form were fit to be used elliptically. For example: "The same phrenzy had hindered the Dutch from improving to <i>their</i> and to the common advantage the public misfortunes of France."--<i>Bolingbroke, on Hist.</i>, p. 309. Here the possessive case <i>their</i> appears to be governed by <i>advantage</i> understood, and therefore it would perhaps be better to say, <i>theirs</i>, or <i>their own</i>. But in the following instance, <i>our</i> may be proper, because both possessives appear to be governed by one and the same noun:--</p>
<pre>  "Although 'twas <i>our</i> and <i>their</i> opinion
   Each other's church was but a Rimmon."--<i>Hudibras</i>.
</pre>
<p>OBS. 3.--<i>Mine</i> and <i>thine</i> were formerly preferred to <i>my</i> and <i>thy</i>, before all words beginning with a vowel sound; or rather, <i>mine</i> and <i>thine</i> were the original forms,[207] and <i>my</i> and <i>thy</i> were first substituted for them before consonants, and afterwards before vowels: as, "But it was thou, a man <i>mine</i> equal, <i>my</i> guide, and <i>mine</i> acquaintance."--<i>Psalms</i>, lv, 13. "<i>Thy</i> prayers and <i>thine</i> alms are come up for a memorial before God."--<i>Acts</i>, x, 4. When the Bible was translated, either form appears to have been used before the letter <i>h</i>; as, "Hath not <i>my hand</i> made all these things?"--<i>Acts</i>, vii, 50. "By stretching forth <i>thine hand</i> to heal."--<i>Acts</i>, iv, 30. According to present practice, <i>my</i> and <i>thy</i> are in general to be preferred before all nouns, without regard to the sounds of letters. The use of the other forms, in the manner here noticed, has now become obsolete; or, at least, antiquated, and peculiar to the poets. We occasionally meet with it in modern verse, though not very frequently, and only where the melody of the line seems to require it: as,</p>
<pre>  "Time writes no wrinkle on <i>thine</i> azure brow."--<i>Byron</i>.
</pre>
<pre>   "Deign on the passing world to turn <i>thine</i> eyes."--<i>Johnson</i>.
</pre>
<pre>   "<i>Mine</i> eyes beheld the messenger divine."--<i>Lusiad</i>.
</pre>
<pre>   "<i>Thine</i> ardent symphony sublime and high."--<i>Sir W. Scott</i>.
</pre>
<p>OBS. 4.--The possessives <i>mine, thine, hers, ours, yours, theirs</i>, usually denote possession, or the relation of property, with an <i>ellipsis</i> of the name of the thing possessed; as, "My sword and <i>yours</i> are kin."--<i>Shakspeare</i>. Here <i>yours</i> means <i>your sword</i>. "You may imagine what kind of faith <i>theirs</i> was."--<i>Bacon</i>. Here <i>theirs</i> means <i>their faith</i>. "He ran headlong into his own ruin whilst he endeavoured to precipitate <i>ours</i>."--<i>Bolingbroke</i>. Here <i>ours</i> means <i>our ruin</i>. "Every one that heareth these saying of <i>mine</i>."--<i>Matt.</i>, vii, 26. Here <i>mine</i> means <i>my</i> sayings<i>. "Sing unto the Lord, O ye saints of</i> his<i>."--</i>Psalms<i>, xxx, 4.</i> Here <i>his</i> means <i>his saints</i>. The noun which governs the possessive, is here <i>understood</i> after it, being inferred from that which precedes, as it is in all the foregoing instances. "And the man of <i>thine</i>, whom I shall not cut off from <i>mine</i> altar, shall be to consume <i>thine</i> eyes, and to grieve <i>thine</i> heart."--<i>1 Samuel</i>, ii, 33. Here <i>thine</i>, in the first phrase, means <i>thy men</i>; but, in the subsequent parts of the sentence, both <i>mine and thine</i> mean neither more nor less than <i>thy</i> and <i>my</i>, because there is no ellipsis. <i>Of</i> before the possessive case, governs the noun which is understood after this case; and is always taken in a <i>partitive</i> sense, and not as the sign of the possessive relation: as, "When we say, 'a soldier <i>of the king's<b>, we mean,</b> one of</i> the king's <i>soldiers</i>.'"--<i>Webster's Improved Gram.</i>, p. 29. There is therefore an ellipsis of the word <i>soldiers</i>, in the former phrase. So, in the following example, <i>mine</i> is used elliptically for <i>my feet</i>; or rather, <i>feet</i> is understood after <i>mine</i>, though <i>mine feet</i> is no longer good English, for reasons before stated:--</p>
<pre>  "Ere I absolve thee, stoop I that on thy neck
   Levelled with earth tins <i>foot of mine</i> may tread."--<i>Wordsworth</i>.
</pre>
<p>OBS. 5.--Respecting the <i>possessive case</i> of the simple personal pronouns, there appears among our grammarians a strange diversity of sentiment. Yet is there but one view of the matter, that has in it either truth or reason, consistency or plausibility. And, in the opinion of any judicious teacher, an erroneous classification of words so common and so important as these, may well go far to condemn any system of grammar in which it is found. A pronoun agrees in person, number, and gender, with the noun <i>for which it</i> is a substitute<i>; and, if it is in the possessive case, it is usually</i> governed by <i>an other noun</i> expressed or implied after it. That is, if it denotes possession, it stands for the name of the possessor, and is governed by the name of the thing possessed. Now do not <i>my, thy, his, her,</i> our, your, their<i>, and</i> mine, thine, hers, its, ours, yours, theirs<i>, all</i> equally denote possession? and do they not severally show by their forms the person, the number, and sometimes also the gender, of whomever or whatever they make to be the possessor? If they do, they are all of them <i>pronouns</i>, and nothing else; all found in the <i>possessive case</i>, and nowhere else. It is true, that in Latin, Greek, and some other languages, there are not only genitive cases corresponding to these possessives, but also certain declinable adjectives which we render in English by these same words: that is, by <i>my</i> or <i>mine, our</i> or <i>ours; thy</i> or <i>thine, your</i> or <i>yours</i>; &amp;c. But this circumstance affords no valid argument for considering any of these English terms to be mere adjectives; and, say what we will, it is plain that they have not the signification of adjectives, nor can we ascribe to them the construction of adjectives, without making their grammatical agreement to be what it very manifestly is not. They never agree, in any respect, with the nouns which <i>follow</i> them, unless it be by mere accident. This view of the matter is sustained by the authority of many of our English grammars; as may be seen by the declensions given by Ash, C. Adams, Ainsworth, R. W. Bailey, Barnard, Buchanan, Bicknell, Blair, Burn, Butler, Comly, Churchill, Cobbett, Dalton, Davenport, Dearborn, Farnum, A. Flint, Fowler, Frost, Gilbert, S. S. Green, Greenleaf, Hamlin, Hiley, Kirkham, Merchant, Murray the schoolmaster, Parkhurst, Picket, Russell, Sanborn, Sanders, R. C. Smith, Wilcox.</p>
<p>OBS. 6.--In opposition to the classification and doctrine adopted above, many of our grammarians teach, that <i>my, thy, this, her, our, your, their</i>, are adjectives or "adjective pronouns;" and that <i>mine, thine, hers, its,</i> ours, yours, theirs<i>, are personal pronouns in the possessive case. Among</i> the supporters of this notion, are D. Adams, Alden, Alger, Allen, Bacon, Barrett, Bingham, Bucke, Bullions, Cutler, Fisk, Frost, (in his small Grammar,) Guy, Hall, Hart, Harrison, Ingersoll, Jaudon, Lennie, Lowth, Miller, L. Murray, Pond, T. Smith, Spear, Spencer, Staniford, Webber, Woodworth. The authority of all these names, however, amounts to little more than that of one man; for Murray pretended to follow Lowth, and nearly all the rest copied Murray. Dr. Lowth says, "<i>Thy, my, her, our, your,</i> their<i>, are pronominal adjectives; but</i> his<i>, (that is,</i> he's<i>,)</i> her's, our's, your's, their's<i>, have evidently the form of the possessive case:</i> And, by analogy, <i>mine, thine</i>, may be esteemed of the same rank."--<i>Lowth's Gram.</i>, p. 23.[208] But why did he not see, that by the same analogy, and also by the sense and meaning of the words, as well as by their distinctions of person, number, and gender, all the other six are entitled to "the same rank?" Are not the forms of <i>my, thy, her, our, your,</i> their<i>, as fit to denote the relation of property, and to be called the</i> possessive case, as <i>mine, thine, his</i>, or any others? In grammar, all needless distinctions are reprehensible. And where shall we find a more blamable one than this? It seems to have been based merely upon the false notion, that the possessive case of pronouns ought to be formed like that of nouns; whereas custom has clearly decided that they shall always be different: the former must never be written with an apostrophe; and the latter, never without it. Contrary to all good usage, however, the Doctor here writes "<i>her's, our's, your's, their's</i>," each with a needless apostrophe. Perhaps he thought it would serve to strengthen his position; and help to refute what some affirmed, that all these words are adjectives.</p>
<p>OBS. 7.--Respecting <i>mine, thine</i>, and <i>his</i>, Lowth and L. Murray disagree. The latter will have them to be sometimes "<i>possessive pronouns</i>," and sometimes "<i>possessive cases</i>." An admirable distinction this for a great author to make! too slippery for even the inventor's own hold, and utterly unintelligible to those who do not know its history! In short, these authors disagree also concerning <i>my, thy, her, our, your, their</i>; and where two leaders of a party are at odds with each other, and each is in the wrong, what is to be expected from their followers? Perceiving that Lowth was wrong in calling these words "<i>pronominal adjectives</i>," Murray changed the term to "<i>possessive pronouns</i>," still retaining the class entire; and accordingly taught, in his early editions, that, "There are <i>four kinds</i> of pronouns, viz., the personal, <i>the possessive, the</i> relative, and <i>the</i> adjective pronouns."--<i>Murray's Gram.</i>, 2d Edition, p. 37. "The Possessive Pronouns are such as principally relate to possession or property. There are seven of them; viz. <i>my, thy, his, her, our, your,</i> their<i>. The possessives</i> his, mine, thine<i>, may be accounted either</i> <i>possessive pronouns</i>, or the <i>possessive cases</i> of their respective personal pronouns."--<i>Ib.</i>, p. 40. He next idly demonstrates that these seven words may come before nouns of any number or case, without variation; then, forgetting his own distinction, adds, "When they are separated from the noun, all of them, except <i>his</i>, vary <i>their terminations</i>; as, this hat is <i>mine</i>, and the other is <i>thine</i>; those trinkets are <i>hers</i>; this house is <i>ours</i>, and that is <i>yours; theirs</i> is more commodious than <i>ours</i>"--<i>Ib.</i>, p. 40. Thus all his personal pronouns of the possessive case, he then made to be inflections of pronouns of <i>a different class!</i> What are they now? Seek the answer under the head of that gross solecism, "<i>Adjective Pronouns</i>." You may find it in one half of our English grammars.</p>
<p>OBS. 8.--Any considerable error in the classing of words, does not stand alone; it naturally brings others in its train. Murray's "<i>Adjective</i> Pronouns<i>," (which he now subdivides into four little classes,</i> possessive, distributive, demonstrative<i>, and</i> indefinite<i>,) being all of them misnamed</i> and misplaced in his etymology, have led both him and many others into strange errors in syntax. The <i>possessives only</i> are "pronouns;" and these are pronouns of the possessive <i>case</i>. As such, they agree with the <i>antecedent</i> nouns for which they stand, in <i>person, number</i>, and <i>gender</i>; and are governed, like all other possessives, by the nouns which follow them. The rest are <i>not pronouns</i>, but pronominal <i>adjectives</i>; and, as such, they relate to nouns expressed or understood <i>after them</i>. Accordingly, they have none of the above-mentioned qualities, except that the words <i>this</i> and <i>that</i> form the plurals <i>these</i> and <i>those</i>. Or, if we choose to ascribe to a pronominal adjective all the properties of the noun understood, it is merely for the sake of brevity in parsing. The difference, then, between a "pronominal adjective" and an "adjective pronoun," should seem to be this; that the one is <i>an adjective</i>, and the other <i>a pronoun</i>: it is like the difference between a <i>horserace</i> and a <i>racehorse</i>. What can be hoped from the grammarian who cannot discern it? And what can be made of rules and examples like the following? "Adjective <i>pronouns</i> must agree, in number, with <i>their substantives</i>: as, '<i>This</i> book, <i>these</i> books; <i>that</i> sort, <i>those</i> sorts; <i>another</i> road, <i>other</i> roads.'"--<i>Murray's Gram.</i>, Rule viii, <i>Late Editions; Alger's Murray</i>, p. 56; <i>Alden's, 85; Bacon's, 48; Maltby's, 59; Miller's, 66; Merchant's, 81;</i> S. Putnam's, 10; and others<i>. "Pronominal</i> adjectives <i>must agree with</i> <i>their nouns</i> in gender, number, and person; thus, '<i>My son</i>, hear the instructions of <i>thy</i> father.' 'Call the <i>labourers</i>, and give them <i>their</i> hire.'"--<i>Maunder's Gram.</i>, Rule xvii. Here Murray gives a rule for <i>pronouns</i>, and illustrates it by <i>adjectives</i>; and Maunder, as ingeniously blunders in reverse: he gives a rule for <i>adjectives</i>, and illustrates it by <i>pronouns</i>. But what do they mean by "<i>their substantives</i>," or "<i>their</i> nouns<i>?" As applicable to</i> pronouns<i>, the phrase should mean</i> nouns antecedent<i>; as applicable to</i> adjectives<i>, it should mean</i> nouns subsequent<i>. Both these rules are therefore false, and fit only to</i> bewilder; and the examples to both are totally inapplicable. Murray's was once essentially right, but he afterwards corrupted it, and a multitude of his admirers have since copied the perversion. It formerly stood thus: "The pronominal adjectives <i>this</i> and <i>that, &amp;c</i>. and the numbers[209] <i>one,</i> two<i>, &amp;c., must agree in number with their substantives: as, 'This book,</i> these books; that sort, those sorts; one girl, ten girls; another road, other roads.' "--<i>Murray's Gram.</i>, Rule viii, 2d Ed., 1796.</p>
<p>OBS. 9.--Among our grammarians, some of considerable note have contended, that the personal pronouns have but <i>two cases</i>, the nominative and the objective. Of this class, may be reckoned Brightland, Dr. Johnson, Fisher, Mennye, Cardell, Cooper, Dr. Jas. P. Wilson, W. B. Fowle. and, according to his late grammars, Dr. Webster. But, in contriving what to make of <i>my</i> or <i>mine, our</i> or <i>ours, thy</i> or <i>thine, your</i> or <i>yours, his, her</i> or <i>hers,</i> its<i>, and</i> their <i>or</i> theirs<i>, they are as far from any agreement, or even</i> from self-consistency, as the cleverest of them could ever imagine. To the person, the number, the gender, and the case, of each of these words, they either profess themselves to be total strangers, or else prove themselves so, by the absurdities they teach. Brightland calls them "Possessive Qualities, or Qualities of Possession;" in which class he also embraces all <i>nouns</i> of the possessive case. Johnson calls them pronouns; and then says of them, "The possessive <i>pronouns</i>, like <i>other adjectives</i>, are without <i>cases</i> or change of termination."--<i>Gram.</i>, p. 6. Fisher calls them "Personal Possessive Qualities;" admits the person of <i>my, our</i>, &amp;c.; but supposes <i>mine, ours</i>, &amp;c. to supply the place of the <i>nouns which govern</i> them! <i>Mennye makes them one of his three classes of pronouns, "</i>personal, possessive<i>, and</i> relative<i>;" giving to both forms the rank which Murray</i> once gave, and which Allen now gives, to the first form only. Cardell places them among his "defining adjectives." With Fowle, these, and all other possessives, are "possessive adjectives." Cooper, in his grammar of 1828. copies the last scheme of Murray: in that of 1831, he avers that the personal pronouns "want the possessive case." Now, like Webster and Wilson, he will have <i>mine, thine, hers, ours, yours</i>, and <i>theirs</i>, to be pronouns of the nominative or the objective case. Dividing the pronouns into six general classes, he makes these the fifth; calling them "Possessive Pronouns," but preferring in a note the monstrous name, "<i>Possessive</i> Pronouns Substitute<i>." His sixth class are what he calls, "The Possessive</i> Pronominal <i>Adjectives</i>;" namely, "<i>my, thy, his, her, our, your, their,</i> its, own<i>, and sometimes</i> mine <i>and</i> thine<i>."--</i>Cooper's Pl. and Pr. Gram.<i>, p. 43. But all these he has, unquestionably, either misplaced or</i> misnamed; while he tells us, that, "Simplicity of arrangement should be the object of every compiler."--<i>Ib.</i>, p. 33. Dr. Perley, (in whose scheme of grammar all the pronouns are <i>nouns</i>,) will have <i>my, thy, his, her, its,</i> our, your<i>, and</i> their<i>, to be in the possessive case; but of</i> mine, thine, hers, ours, yours<i>, and</i> theirs<i>, he says, "These may be called</i> <i>Desiderative Personal Pronouns</i>."--<i>Perley's Gram.</i>, p. 15.</p>
<p>OBS. 10.--Kirkham, though he professes to follow Murray, declines the simple personal pronouns as I have declined them; and argues admirably, that <i>my, thy, his, &amp;c.</i>, are pronouns of the possessive case, because, "They always <i>stand for nouns in the possessive case</i>." But he afterwards contradicts both himself and the common opinion of all former grammarians, in referring <i>mine, thine, hers</i>, &amp;c., to the class of "<i>Compound Personal</i> Pronouns.<i>" Nay, as if to outdo even himself in absurdity, he first makes</i> <i>mine, thine, hers, ours</i>, &amp;c., to be compounds, by assuming that, "These <i>pluralizing adjuncts, ne</i> and <i>s</i>, were, no doubt, formerly detached from the pronouns with which they now coalesce;" and then, because he finds in each of his supposed compounds the signification of a pronoun and its governing noun, reassumes, in parsing them, the very principle of error, on which he condemns their common classification. He says, "They should be parsed <i>as two words</i>." He also supposes them to represent the nouns <i>which</i> govern them<i>--nouns with which they do not agree in any respect! Thus is he</i> wrong in almost every thing he says about them. See <i>Kirkham's Gram.</i>, p. 99, p. 101, and p. 104. Goodenow, too, a still later writer, adopts the major part of all this absurdity. He will have <i>my, thy, his, her, its,</i> our, your, their<i>, for the possessive case of his personal pronouns; but</i> <i>mine, thine, hers, ours, yours, theirs</i>, he calls "<i>compound possessive</i> pronouns<i>, in the subjective or [the] objective case."--</i>Text-Book of E. Gram.<i>, p. 33. Thus he introduces a new class, unknown to his primary</i> division of the pronouns, and not included in his scheme of their declension. Fuller, too, in a grammar produced at Plymouth, Mass., in 1822, did nearly the same thing. He called <i>I, thou, he, she</i>, and <i>it</i>, with their plurals, "<i>antecedent</i> pronouns;" took <i>my, thy, his, her</i>, &amp;c., for their <i>only</i> possessive forms in his declension; and, having passed from them by the space of just half his book, added: "Sometimes, to prevent the repetition of the same word, an <i>antecedent pronoun in the possessive</i> case<i>, is made to represent, both the pronoun and a noun; as, 'That book is</i> <i>mine<b>--i. e.</b> my book</i>.' MINE is a <i>compound antecedent pronoun</i>, and is equivalent to <i>my</i> book. Then parse <i>my</i>, and <i>book</i>, as though they were both expressed."--<i>Fuller's Gram.</i>, p. 71.</p>
<p>OBS. 11.--Amidst all this diversity of doctrine at the very centre of grammar, who shall so fix its principles that our schoolmasters and schoolmistresses may know <i>what to believe and teach</i>? Not he that speculates without regard to other men's views; nor yet he that makes it a merit to follow implicitly "the footsteps of" <i>one only</i>. The true principles of grammar are with the learned; and that man is in the wrong, with whom the <i>most</i> learned will not, in general, coincide. Contradiction of falsities, is necessary to the maintenance of truth; correction of errors, to the success of science. But not every man's errors can be so considerable as to deserve correction from other hands than his own. Misinstruction in grammar has for this reason generally escaped censure. I do not wish any one to coincide with me merely through ignorance of what others inculcate. If doctors of divinity and doctors of laws will contradict themselves in teaching grammar, so far as they do so, the lovers of consistency will find it necessary to deviate from their track. Respecting these pronouns, I learned in childhood, from Webster, a doctrine which he now declares to be false. This was nearly the same as Lowth's, which is quoted in the sixth observation above. But, in stead of correcting its faults, this zealous reformer has but run into others still greater. Now, with equal reproach to his etymology, his syntax, and his logic, he denies that our pronouns have any form of the possessive case at all. But grant the obvious fact, that <i>substitution</i> is one thing, and <i>ellipsis</i> an other, and his whole argument is easily overthrown; for it is only by confounding these, that he reaches his absurd conclusion.</p>
<p>OBS. 12.--Dr. Webster's doctrine now is, that none of the English pronouns have more than two cases. He says, "<i>mine, thine, his, hers, yours</i>, and <i>theirs</i>, are <i>usually considered</i> as [being of] the possessive case. But the <i>three first</i> are either attributes, and used with nouns, or they are substitutes. The <i>three last</i> are always substitutes, used in the place of names WHICH ARE UNDERSTOOD."--"That <i>mine, thine, his</i>, [<i>ours</i>,] <i>yours,</i> hers<i>, and</i> theirs<i>, do not constitute a possessive case, is demonstrable;</i> for they are constantly used as the nominatives to verbs and as the objectives after verbs and prepositions, as in the following passages. 'Whether it could perform its operations of thinking and memory out of a body organized as <i>ours is</i>.'--<i>Locke</i>. 'The reason is, that his subject is generally things; <i>theirs</i>, on the contrary, <i>is</i> persons.'--<i>Camp. Rhet.</i> 'Therefore leave your forest of beasts for <i>ours</i> of brutes, called men.'--<i>Wycherley to Pope</i>. It is needless to multiply proofs. We observe these <i>pretended possessives</i> uniformly used as nominatives or objectives.[210] Should it be said that <i>a noun is understood</i>; I reply, <i>this cannot be true</i>," &amp;c.--<i>Philosophical Gram.</i>, p. 35; <i>Improved</i> Gram.<i>, p. 26. Now, whether it be true or not, this very position is</i> expressly affirmed by the Doctor himself, in the citation above; though he is, unquestionably, wrong in suggesting that the pronouns are "used <i>in the</i> place <i>of [those] names WHICH ARE UNDERSTOOD." They are used in the place</i> of other names--the names of <i>the possessors</i>; and are governed by those which he here both admits and denies to be "understood."</p>
<p>OBS. 13.--The other arguments of Dr. Webster against the possessive case of pronouns, may perhaps be more easily answered than some readers imagine. The first is drawn from the fact that conjunctions connect like cases. "Besides, in three passages just quoted, the word <i>yours</i> is joined by a connective <i>to a name</i> in the same case; 'To ensure <i>yours</i> and <i>their</i> immortality<i>.' 'The easiest part of</i> yours <i>and</i> my design<i>.' <b>My sword</b></i> and <i>yours</i> are kin.' Will any person pretend that the connective here joins different cases?"--<i>Improved Gram.</i>, p. 28; <i>Philosophical Gram.</i>, p. 36. I answer, No. But it is falsely assumed that <i>yours</i> is here connected by <i>and</i> to <i>immortality</i>, to <i>design</i>, or to <i>sword</i>; because these words are again severally understood after <i>yours</i>: or, if otherwise, the two pronouns alone are connected by <i>and</i>, so that the proof is rather, that <i>their</i> and <i>my</i> are in the possessive case. The second argument is drawn from the use of the preposition <i>of</i> before the possessive. "For we say correctly, 'an acquaintance <i>of yours, ours</i>, or <i>theirs'</i>--<i>of</i> being the sign of the possessive; but if the words in themselves are possessives, then there must be two signs of the same case, which is absurd."--<i>Improved</i> Gram.<i>, p. 28;</i> Phil. Gr.<i>, 36. I deny that</i> of <i>is here the sign of the</i> possessive, and affirm that it is taken partitively, in all examples of this sort. "I know my sheep, and am known <i>of mine</i>," is not of this kind; because <i>of</i> here means <i>by</i>--a sense in which the word is antiquated. In recurring afterwards to this argument, the Doctor misquotes the following texts, and avers that they "are evidently meant to include the <i>whole</i> number<i>: 'Sing</i> to <i>the Lord,</i> all <i>ye saints of</i> his<i>.'--</i>Ps. <i>30, 4.</i> <b>He <i>that heareth these sayings</i> of mine<i>.'--</i>Matt. <i>7."--</i>Improved</b> Gram.<i>, p. 29;</i> Phil. Gr.<i>, 38. If he is right about the meaning, however,</i> the passages are mistranslated, as well as misquoted: they ought to be, "Sing <i>unto</i> the Lord, <i>O ye his Saints</i>."--"<i>Every one</i> that heareth <i>these my sayings</i>." But when a definitive particle precedes the noun, it is very common with us, to introduce the possessive elliptically after it; and what Dr. Wilson means by suggesting that it is erroneous, I know not: "When the preposition <i>of</i> precedes <i>mine, ours, yours</i>, &amp;c. the <i>errour</i> lies, not in this, that there are double possessive cases, but in forming an implication of a noun, which the substitute already denotes, together with the persons."--<i>Essay on Gram.</i>, p. 110.</p>
<p>OBS. 14.--In his Syllabus of English Grammar, Dr. Wilson teaches thus: "<i>My, our, thy, your, his, her, its, their, whose</i>, and <i>whosesoever</i> are possessive pronominal <i>adjectives. Ours, yours, hers</i>, and <i>theirs</i> are <i>pronoun substantives</i>, used either as subjects, or [as] objects; as singulars, or [as] plurals; and are substituted both for [the names of] the possessors, and [for those of the] things possessed. <i>His, its, whose,</i> mine<i>, and</i> thine<i>, are sometimes used as</i> such substantives<i>; but also are</i> at other times <i>pronominal possessive</i> adjectives."--<i>Wilson's Syllabus</i>, p. X. Now compare with these three positions, the following three from the same learned author. "In Hebrew, the <i>adjective</i> generally agrees with its noun in gender and number, but <i>pronouns</i> follow the gender of their antecedents, and not of the nouns with which they stand. So in English, <i>my, thy, his, her, its, our, your</i>, and <i>their</i>, agree with the nouns they represent, in number, gender, and person. But <i>adjectives</i>, having no change expressive of number, gender, or case, cannot accord with their nouns."--<i>Wilson's Essay on Gram.</i>, p. 192. "<i>Ours, yours, hers</i>, and <i>theirs</i>, are most usually considered possessive cases of personal pronouns; but they are, more probably, possessive substitutes, not adjectives, but <i>nouns</i>."--<i>Ib.</i>, p. 109. "Nor can <i>mine</i> or <i>thine</i>, with any more propriety than <i>ours, yours</i>, &amp;c. be joined to any noun, as possessive adjectives and possessive cases may."--<i>Ib.</i>, p. 110. Whoever understands these instructions, cannot but see their inconsistency.</p>
<p>OBS. 15.--Murray argues at some length, without naming his opponents, that the words which he assumes to be such, are really personal pronouns standing rightfully in the possessive case; and that, "they should not, on the slight pretence of their differing from nouns, be dispossessed of the right and privilege, which, from time immemorial they have enjoyed."--<i>Octavo Gram.</i>, p. 53. Churchill as ably shows, that the corresponding terms, which Lowth calls <i>pronominal adjectives</i>, and which Murray and others will have to be <i>pronouns of no case</i>, are justly entitled to the same rank. "If <i>mine, thine, hers, ours, yours, theirs</i>, be the possessive case; <i>my, thy, her, our, your, their</i>, must be the same. Whether we say, 'It is <i>John's</i> book,' or, 'The book is <i>John's</i>;' <i>John's</i> is not less the possessive case in one instance, than it is in the other. If we say, 'It is <i>his</i> book,' or, 'The book is <i>his</i>;' 'It is <i>her</i> book,' or, 'The book is <i>hers</i>;' 'It is <i>my</i> book,' or, 'The book is <i>mine</i>;' 'It is <i>your</i> book,' or, 'The book is <i>yours</i>;' are not these parallel instances? Custom has established it as a law, that this case of the pronoun shall drop its original termination, for the sake of euphony, when it precedes the noun that governs it; retaining it only where the noun is understood: but this certainly makes no alteration in the nature of the word; so that either <i>my</i> is as much a possessive case as <i>mine</i>; or <i>mine</i> and <i>my</i> are equally pronominal adjectives."--<i>Churchill's New Gram.</i>, p. 221. "Mr. Murray considers the phrases, <b>our desire<i>,'</i></b> <i>your</i> intention<i>,' <b>their resignation</b></i><b>,' as instances of plural adjectives</b> <i>agreeing</i> with singular nouns; and consequently exceptions to the general (may we not say <i>universal</i>?) rule: but if they [the words <i>our, your,</i> their<i>,] be, as is attempted to be proved above, the possessive cases of</i> pronouns, no rule is here violated."--<i>Ib.</i>, p. 224.</p>
<p>OBS. 16.--One strong argument, touching this much-disputed point of grammar, was incidentally noticed in the observations upon antecedents: an adjective cannot give person, number, and gender, to a relative pronoun; because, in our language, adjectives do not possess these qualities; nor indeed in any other, except as they take them by immediate agreement with nouns or pronouns in the same clause. But it is undeniable, that <i>my, thy,</i> his, her, our, your, their<i>, do sometimes stand as antecedents, and give</i> person, number, and gender to relatives, which head other clauses. For the learner should remember, that, "When a relative pronoun is used, the sentence is divided into two parts; viz. the <i>antecedent</i> sentence, or that which contains the <i>antecedent</i>; and the <i>relative</i> sentence, containing the <i>relative</i>."--<i>Nixon's Parser</i>, p. 123. We need not here deny, that Terence's Latin, as quoted in the grammars, "Omnes laudare fortunas <i>meas,</i> qui <i>haberem gnatum tali ingeuio præditum," is quite as intelligible</i> syntax, as can literally be made of it in English--"That all would praise <i>my</i> fortunes, <i>who had</i> a son endued with such a genius." For, whether the Latin be good or not, it affords no argument against us, except that of a supposed analogy; nor does the literality of the version prove, at all points, either the accuracy or the sameness of the construction.</p>
<p>OBS. 17.--Surely, without some imperative reason, we ought not, in English, to resort to such an assumption as is contained in the following Rule: "Sometimes the relative agrees in person with that pronoun substantive, from which the possessive pronoun adjective is derived; as, Pity <i>my</i> condition, <i>who am</i> so destitute. I rejoice at <i>thy</i> lot, <i>who art</i> so fortunate. We lament <i>his</i> fate, <i>who is</i> so unwary. Beware of <i>her</i> cunning, <i>who is</i> so deceitful. Commiserate <i>our</i> condition, <i>who are</i> so poor. Tremble at <i>your</i> negligence, <i>who are</i> so careless. It shall be <i>their</i> property, <i>who are</i> so diligent. We are rejoicing at <i>thy</i> lot, <i>who hast</i> been so fortunate."--<i>Nixon's Parser</i>, p. 142. In his explanation of the last of these sentences, the author says, "<i>Who</i> is a relative pronoun; in the masculine gender, singular number, second person, and agrees with <i>thee</i>, implied in the adjective <i>thy</i>. RULE.--Sometimes the relative agrees in person, &amp;c. And it is the nominative to the verb <i>hast been</i>. RULE.--When no nominative comes between the relative and the verb, the relative is the nominative to the verb."--<i>Ib.</i>, p. 143. A pupil of G. Brown's would have said, "<i>Who</i> is a relative pronoun, representing '<i>thy</i>,' or the person addressed, in the second person, singular number, and masculine gender; according to the rule which says, 'A pronoun must agree with its antecedent, or the noun or pronoun which it represents, in person, number, and gender:' and is in the nominative case, being the subject of <i>hast been</i>; according to the rule which says, 'A noun or a pronoun which is the subject of a finite verb, must be in the nominative case.' Because the meaning is--<i>who hast been</i>; that is, <i>thy lot</i>, or the lot <i>of thee, who hast been</i>."</p>
<p>OBS. 18.--Because the possessive case of a noun or pronoun is usually equivalent in meaning to the preposition <i>of</i> and the objective case, some grammarians, mistaking this equivalence of meaning for sameness of case, have asserted that all our possessives have a double form. Thus Nixon: "When the particle <i>of</i> comes between two substantives signifying different things, it is not to be considered a preposition, but <i>the sign of the</i> substantive's being in the possessive case<i>, equally as if the apostrophic</i> <i>s</i> had been affixed to it; as, 'The skill <i>of Cæsar</i>,' or <i>Cæsar's</i> skill.'"--<i>English Parser</i>, p. 38. "When the apostrophic <i>s</i> is used, the genitive is the former of the two substantives; as, '<i>John's</i> house:' but when the particle <i>of</i> is used, it is the latter; as, 'The house <i>of</i> John<i>.'"--</i>Ib.<i>, p. 46. The work here quoted is adapted to two different</i> grammars; namely, Murray's and Allen's. These the author doubtless conceived to be the best English grammars extant. And it is not a little remarkable, that both of these authors, as well as many others, teach in such a faulty manner, that their intentions upon this point may be matter of dispute. "When Murray, Allen, and others, say, 'we make use of the particle <i>of</i> to express the <i>relation</i> of the genitive,' the ambiguity of their assertion leaves it in doubt whether or not they considered the substantive which is preceded by <i>of</i> and an other substantive, as in the <i>genitive</i> case."--<i>Nixon's English Parser</i>, p. 38. Resolving this doubt according to his own fancy, Nixon makes the possessive case of our personal pronouns to be as follows: "<i>mine</i> or <i>of me, ours</i> or <i>of us; thine</i> or <i>of thee, yours</i> or <i>of you; his</i> or <i>of him, theirs</i> or <i>of them; hers</i> or <i>of her, theirs</i> or <i>of them; its</i> or <i>of it, theirs</i> or <i>of</i> them<i>."--</i>English Parser<i>, p. 43. This doctrine gives us a form of</i> declension that is both complex and deficient. It is therefore more objectionable than almost any of those which are criticised above. The arguments and authorities on which the author rests his position, are not thought likely to gain many converts; for which reason, I dismiss the subject, without citing or answering them.</p>
<p>OBS. 19.--In old books, we sometimes find the word <i>I</i> written for the adverb <i>ay</i>, yes: as, "To dye, to sleepe; To sleepe, perchance to dreame; <i>I</i>, there's the rub."--<i>Shakspeare, Old Copies</i>. The British Grammar, printed in 1784, and the Grammar of Murray the schoolmaster, published some years earlier than Lindley Murray's, say: "We use <i>I</i> as an Answer, in a familiar, careless, or merry Way; as, 'I, I, Sir, I, I;' but to use <i>ay</i>, is accounted rude, especially to our Betters." See <i>Brit. Gram.</i>, p. 198. The age of this rudeness, or incivility, if it ever existed, has long passed away; and the fashion seems to be so changed, that to write or utter <i>I</i> for <i>ay</i>, would now in its turn be "accounted <i>rude</i>"--the rudeness of ignorance--a false orthography, or a false pronunciation. In the word <i>ay</i>, the two sounds of <i>ah-ee</i> are plainly heard; in the sound of <i>I</i>, the same elements are more quickly blended. (See a note at the foot of page 162.) When this sound is suddenly repeated, some writers make a new word of it, which must be called an <i>interjection</i>: as, "'Pray, answer me a question or two.' '<i>Ey, ey</i>, as many as you please, cousin Bridget, an they be not too hard.'"--<i>Burgh's Speaker</i>, p. 99. "<i>Ey, ey</i>, 'tis so; she's out of her head, poor thing."--<i>Ib.</i>, p. 100. This is probably a corruption of <i>ay</i>, which is often doubled in the same manner: thus,</p>
<pre>  "<i>Ay, ay</i>, Antipholus, look strange, and frown."--<i>Shakspeare</i>.
</pre>
<p>OBS. 20.--The common fashion of address being nowadays altogether in the plural form, the pronouns <i>thou, thy, thine, thee</i>, and <i>thyself</i>, have become unfamiliar to most people, especially to the vulgar and uneducated. These words are now confined almost exclusively to the writings of the poets, to the language of the Friends, to the Holy Scriptures, and to the solemn services of religion. They are, however, the <i>only genuine</i> representatives of the second person singular, in English; and to displace them from that rank in grammar, or to present <i>you, your</i>, and <i>yours</i>, as being literally singular, though countenanced by several late writers, is a useless and pernicious innovation. It is sufficient for the information of the learner, and far more consistent with learning and taste, to say, that the plural is fashionably used <i>for the singular</i>, by a figure of syntax; for, in all correct usage of this sort, the <i>verb</i> is plural, as well as the pronoun--Dr. Webster's fourteen authorities to the contrary notwithstanding. For, surely, "<i>You was</i>" cannot be considered good English, merely because that number of respectable writers have happened, on some particular occasions, to adopt the phrase; and even if we must needs concede this point, and grant to the Doctor and his converts, that "<i>You was</i> is <i>primitive</i> and <i>correct</i>," the example no more proves that <i>you</i> is singular, than that <i>was</i> is plural. And what is one singular irregular preterit, compared with all the verbs in the language?</p>
<p>OBS. 21.--In our present authorized version of the Bible, the numbers and cases of the second person are kept remarkably distinct,[211] the pronouns being always used in the following manner: <i>thou</i> for the nominative, <i>thy</i> or <i>thine</i> for the possessive, and <i>thee</i> for the objective, singular; <i>ye</i> for the nominative, <i>your</i> or <i>yours</i> for the possessive, and <i>you</i> for the objective, plural. Yet, before that version was made, fashionable usage had commonly substituted <i>you</i> for <i>ye</i>, making the former word nominative as well as objective, and applying it to one hearer as well as to more. And subsequently, as it appears, the religious sect that entertained a scruple about applying <i>you</i> to an individual, fell for the most part into an ungrammatical practice of putting <i>thee</i> for <i>thou</i>; making, in like manner, the objective pronoun to be both nominative and objective; or, at least, using it very commonly so in their conversation. Their manner of speaking, however, was not--or, certainly, with the present generation of their successors, <i>is</i> not--as some grammarians represent it to be, that formal and antique phraseology which we call <i>the solemn style</i>.[212] They make no more use of the pronoun <i>ye</i>, or of the verbal termination <i>eth</i>, than do people of fashion; nor do they, in using the pronoun <i>thou</i>, or their improper nominative <i>thee</i>, ordinarily inflect with <i>st</i> or <i>est</i> the preterits or the auxiliaries of the accompanying verbs, as is done in the solemn style. Indeed, to use the solemn style familiarly, would be, to turn it into burlesque; as when Peter Pindar "<i>telleth what he troweth.</i>" [213] And let those who think with Murray, that our present version of the Scriptures <i>is the best standard</i> of English grammar,[214] remember that in it they have no warrant for substituting <i>s</i> or <i>es</i> for the old termination <i>eth</i>, any more than for ceasing to use the solemn style of the second person familiarly. That version was good in its day, yet it shows but very imperfectly what the English language now is. Can we consistently take for our present standard, a style which does not allow us to use <i>you</i> in the nominative case, or <i>its</i> for the possessive? And again, is not a simplification of the verb as necessary and proper in the familiar use of the second person singular, as in that of the third? This latter question I shall discuss in a future chapter.</p>
<p>OBS. 22.--The use of the pronoun <i>ye</i> in the nominative case, is now mostly confined to the solemn style;[215] but the use of it in the objective, which is disallowed in the solemn style, and nowhere approved by our grammarians, is nevertheless <i>common</i> when no emphasis falls upon the word: as,</p>
<pre>  "When you're unmarried, never load <i>ye</i>
   With jewels; they may incommode <i>ye</i>."--<i>Dr. King</i>, p. 384.
</pre>
<p>Upon this point, Dr. Lowth observes, "Some writers have used <i>ye</i> as the objective case plural of the pronoun of the second person, very improperly and ungrammatically; [as,]</p>
<pre>   'The more shame for <i>ye</i>; holy men I thought <i>ye</i>.' Shak. Hen. VIII.
</pre>
<pre>   'But tyrants dread <i>ye</i>, lest your just decree
   Transfer the pow'r, and set the people free.' Prior.
</pre>
<pre>   'His wrath, which one day will destroy <i>ye</i> both.' Milt. P. L. ii. 734.
</pre>
<p>Milton uses the same manner of expression in a few other places of his Paradise Lost, and more frequently in his [smaller] poems, <i>It may,</i> perhaps, be allowed in the comic and burlesque style<i>, which often imitates</i> a vulgar and incorrect pronunciation; but in the serious and solemn style, <i>no authority is sufficient</i> to justify so manifest a solecism."--<i>Lowth's</i> Gram.<i>, p. 22. Churchill copies this remark, and adds; "Dryden has</i> you <i>as</i> the nominative, and <i>ye</i> as the objective, in the same passage:[216]</p>
<pre>   'What gain <i>you</i>, by forbidding it to tease <i>ye</i>?
   It now can neither trouble <i>ye</i>, nor please <i>ye</i>.'
</pre>
<p>Was this from a notion, that <i>you</i> and <i>ye</i>, thus employed, were more analogous to <i>thou</i> and <i>thee</i> in the singular number?"--<i>Churchill's</i> Gram.<i>, p. 25. I answer, No; but, more probably, from a notion, that the</i> two words, being now confessedly equivalent in the one case, might as well be made so in the other: just as the Friends, in using <i>thee</i> for <i>you</i>, are carelessly converting the former word into a nominative, to the exclusion of <i>thou</i>; because the latter has generally been made so, to the exclusion of <i>ye</i>. When the confounding of such distinctions is begun, who knows where it will end? With like ignorance, some writers suppose, that the fashion of using the plural for the singular is a sufficient warrant for putting the singular for the plural: as,</p>
<pre>  "The joys of love, are they not doubly <i>thine,</i>
   Ye poor!<i> whose health, whose spirits ne'er decline?"</i>
       --<i>Southwick's Pleas. of Poverty.</i>

<pre>   "But, <i>Neatherds</i>, go look to the kine,
     Their cribs with fresh fodder supply;
   The task of compassion be <i>thine</i>,
     For herbage the pastures deny."--<i>Perfect's Poems</i>, p. 5.

<p>OBS. 23.--When used in a burlesque or ludicrous manner, the pronoun <i>ye</i> is sometimes a mere expletive; or, perhaps, intended rather as an objective governed by a preposition understood. But, in such a construction, I see no reason to prefer it to the regular objective <i>you</i>; as,</p>
<pre>  "He'll laugh <i>ye</i>, dance <i>ye</i>, sing <i>ye</i>, vault, look gay,
   And ruffle all the ladies in his play."--<i>King</i>, p. 574.
</pre>
<p>Some grammarians, who will have <i>you</i> to be singular as well as plural, ignorantly tell us, that "<i>ye</i> always means more than one." But the fact is, that when <i>ye</i> was in common use, it was as frequently applied to one person as <i>you</i>: thus,</p>
<pre>  "Farewell my doughter lady Margarete,
   God wotte full oft it grieued hath my mynde,
   That <i>ye</i> should go where we should seldome mete:
   Now am I gone, and haue left <i>you</i> behynde."--<i>Sir T. More</i>, 1503.
</pre>
<p>In the following example, <i>ye</i> is used for <i>thee</i>, the objective singular; and that by one whose knowledge of the English language, is said to have been unsurpassed:--</p>
<pre>  "Proud Baronet of Nova Scotia!
   The Dean and Spaniard must reproach <i>ye</i>."--<i>Swift</i>.
</pre>
<p>So in the story of the Chameleon:--</p>
<pre>  "'Tis green, 'tis green, Sir, I assure <i>ye</i>."--<i>Merrick</i>.
</pre>
<p>Thus we have <i>ye</i> not only for the nominative in both numbers, but at length for the objective in both; <i>ye</i> and <i>you</i> being made everywhere equivalent, by very many writers. Indeed this pronoun has been so frequently used for the objective case, that one may well doubt any grammarian's authority to condemn it in that construction. Yet I cannot but think it ill-chosen in the third line below, though right in the first:--</p>
<pre>  "<i>Ye</i>! who have traced the Pilgrim to the scene
   Which is his last, if in your memories dwell
   A thought which once was his, if on <i>ye</i> swell
   A single recollection, not in vain
   He wore his sandal-shoon, and scallop-shell."--<i>Byron</i>.
</pre>
<p>OBS. 24.--The three pronouns of the third person, <i>he, she</i>, and <i>it</i>, have always formed their plural number after one and the same manner, <i>they,</i> their <i>or</i> theirs, them<i>. Or, rather, these plural words, which appear not</i> to be regular derivatives from any of the singulars, have ever been applied alike to them all. But <i>it</i>, the neuter pronoun singular, had formerly no variation of cases, and is still alike in the nominative and the objective. The possessive <i>its</i> is of comparatively recent origin. In our common Bible, the word is not found, except by misprint; nor do other writings of the same age contain it. The phrase, <i>of it</i>, was often used as an equivalent; as, "And it had three ribs in the mouth <i>of it</i> between the teeth <i>of it</i>."--<i>Dan.</i>, vii, 5. That is--"in <i>its</i> mouth, between <i>its</i> teeth." But, as a possessive case was sometimes necessary, our ancestors used to borrow one; commonly from the masculine, though sometimes from the feminine. This produced what now appears a strange confusion of the genders: as, "<i>Learning</i> hath <i>his</i> infancy, when <i>it</i> is but beginning, and almost childish; then <i>his</i> youth, when <i>it</i> is luxuriant and juvenile; then <i>his</i> strength of years, when <i>it</i> is solid and reduced; and lastly <i>his</i> old age, when <i>it</i> waxeth dry and exhaust."--<i>Bacon's Essays</i>, p. 58. "Of beaten work shall the <i>candlestick</i> be made: <i>his</i> shaft, and <i>his</i> branches, <i>his</i> bowls, <i>his</i> knops, and <i>his</i> flowers, shall be of the same."--<i>Exodus</i>, xxv, 31. "They came and emptied the <i>chest</i>, and took <i>it</i> and carried <i>it</i> to <i>his</i> place again."--<i>2 Chron.</i>, xxiv, 11. "Look not thou upon the <i>wine, when</i> it is red, when <i>it</i> giveth <i>his</i> colour in the cup, when <i>it</i> moveth <i>itself</i> aright."--<i>Prov.</i>, xxiii, 31. "The <i>tree</i> is known by <i>his</i> fruit."--<i>Matt.</i>, xii, 33. "When thou tillest the ground, <i>it</i> shall not henceforth yield unto thee <i>her</i> strength."--<i>Gen.</i>, iv, 12. "He that pricketh the heart, maketh <i>it</i> to show <i>her</i> knowledge."--<i>Eccl.</i>, xxii, 19. Shakspeare rarely, if ever, used <i>its</i>; and his style is sometimes obscure for the want of it: as,</p>
<pre>  "There is no <i>vice</i> so simple, but assumes
   Some mark of virtue on <i>his</i> outward parts."
       --<i>Merch. of Venice</i>.
</pre>
<pre>   "The name of Cassius honours this corruption,
   And <i>chastisement</i> doth therefore hide <i>his</i> head."
       --<i>Jul. Cæs.</i>, Act iv.
</pre>
<p>OBS. 25.--The possessive case of pronouns should never be written with an apostrophe. A few pronominal adjectives taken substantively receive it; but the construction which it gives them, seems to make them nouns: as, <i>one's,</i> other's<i>, and, according to Murray,</i> former's <i>and</i> latter's<i>. The real</i> pronouns that end in <i>s</i>, as <i>his, hers, its, ours, yours, theirs</i>, though true possessives after their kind, have no occasion for this mark, nor does good usage admit it. Churchill, with equal disregard of consistency and authority, gives it to one of them, and denies it to the rest. Referring to the classification of these words as possessives, and of <i>my, thy, her,</i> our, your, their<i>, as adjectives, he says: "It seems as if the termination</i> in <i>s</i> had led to the distinction: but no one will contend, that <i>ours</i> is the possessive case of <i>our</i>, or <i>theirs</i> of <i>their</i>; though <i>ours, yours,</i> hers<i>, and</i> theirs<i>, are often very improperly spelt with an apostrophe, a</i> fault not always imputable to the printer; while in <i>it's</i>, which is unquestionably the possessive case of <i>it</i>, the apostrophe, by a strange perverseness, is almost always omitted."--<i>Churchill Gram.</i>, p. 222. The charge of strange perverseness may, in this instance, I think, be retorted upon the critic; and that, to the fair exculpation of those who choose to conform to the general usage which offends him.</p>
<p>OBS. 26.--Of the compound personal pronouns, this author gives the following account: "<i>Self</i>, in the plural <i>selves</i>, a noun, is often combined with the personal pronouns, in order to express emphasis, or opposition, or the identity of the subject and [the] object of a verb; and thus forms a pronoun <i>relative</i>: as, 'I did it <i>myself</i>;' 'he was not <i>himself</i>, when he said so;' 'the envious torment <i>themselves</i> more than others.' Formerly <i>self</i> and <i>selves</i> were used simply as nouns, and governed the pronoun, which was kept distinct from <i>it</i> [them] in the possessive case: but since <i>they</i> [the pronoun and the noun] have coalesced into one word, <i>they</i> [the compounds] are used only in the following forms: for the first person, <i>myself, ourselves</i>; for the second, <i>thyself</i>, or <i>yourself, yourselves</i>; for the third, <i>himself, herself, itself,</i> themselves<i>: except in the regal style, in which, as generally in the</i> second person, the singular noun is added to the plural pronoun, [making] <i>ourself</i>. Each of these is <i>the same in all three cases.</i>"--<i>Churchill's</i> Gram.<i>, p. 75. In a note referring to the close of this explanation, he</i> adds: "<i>Own</i> also is often employed with the possessive cases of the personal pronouns by way of emphasis, or opposition; but separately, as an adjective, and not combining with them to form <i>a relative</i>: as, 'I did it of <i>my own</i> free will:' 'Did he do it with <i>his own</i> hand?'"--<i>Ib.</i>, p. 227.</p>
<p>OBS. 27.--The preceding instructions, faulty and ungrammatical as they are, seem to be the best that our writers have furnished upon this point. To detect falsities and blunders, is half the grammarian's duty. The pronouns of which the term <i>self</i> or <i>selves</i> forms a part, are used, not for the connecting of different clauses of a sentence, but for the purpose of emphatic distinction in the sense. In calling them "<i>relatives</i>," Churchill is wrong, even by his own showing. They have not the characteristics which he himself ascribes to relatives; but are compound personal pronouns, and nothing else. He is also manifestly wrong in asserting, that they are severally "the same in all three cases." From the very nature of their composition, the possessive case is alike impossible to them all. To express ownership with emphasis or distinction, we employ neither these compounds nor any others; but always use the simple possessives with the separate adjective <i>own</i>: as, "With <i>my own</i> eyes,"--"By <i>thy own</i> confession,"--"To <i>his own</i> house,"--"For <i>her own</i> father,"--"By <i>its own</i> weight,"--"To save <i>our own</i> lives,"--"For <i>your own</i> sake,"--"In <i>their</i> own <i>cause."</i></p>
<p>OBS. 28.--The phrases, <i>my own, thy own, his own</i>, and so forth, Dr. Perley, in his little Grammar, has improperly converted by the hyphen into compound words: calling them the possessive forms of <i>myself, thyself,</i> himself<i>, and so forth; as if one set of compounds could constitute the</i> possessive case of an other! And again, as if the making of eight new pronouns for two great nations, were as slight a feat, as the inserting of so many hyphens! The word <i>own</i>, anciently written <i>owen</i>, is an <i>adjective</i>; from an old form of the perfect participle of the verb <i>to</i> owe<i>; which verb, according to Lowth and others, once signified</i> to possess<i>. It is equivalent to</i> due, proper<i>, or</i> peculiar<i>; and, in its</i> present use as an adjective, it stands nowhere else than between the possessive case and the name of the thing possessed; as, "The Boy's <i>Own</i> Book,"--"Christ's <i>own</i> words,"--"Solomon's <i>own</i> and only son." Dr. Johnson, while he acknowledges the abovementioned derivation, very strangely calls own a noun substantive; and, with not more accuracy, says: "This is a word of no other use than as it is added to the possessive pronouns, <i>my, thy, his, our, your, their</i>."--<i>Quarto Dict., w. Own</i>. O. B. Peirce, with obvious untruth, says, "<i>Own</i> is used in combination with a name or substitute, and as a part of it, to constitute it emphatic."--<i>Gram.</i>, p. 63. He writes it separately, but parses it as a part of the possessive noun or pronoun which precedes it!</p>
<p>OBS. 29.--The word <i>self</i> was originally <i>an adjective</i>, signifying <i>same,</i> very<i>, or</i> particular<i>; but, when used alone, it is now generally</i> a noun<i>.</i> This may have occasioned the diversity which appears in the formation of the compound personal pronouns. Dr. Johnson, in his great Dictionary, calls <i>self</i> a pronoun; but he explains it as being both adjective and substantive, admitting that, "Its primary signification seems to be that of an adjective."--Again he observes, "<i>Myself, himself, themselves</i>, and the rest, may, contrary to the analogy of <i>my, him, them</i>, be used as nominatives." <i>Hisself, itsself</i>, and <i>theirselves</i>, would be more analogical than <i>himself, itself, themselves</i>; but custom has rejected the former, and established the latter. When an adjective qualifies the term <i>self</i>, the pronouns are written separately in the possessive case; as, <i>My</i> single self,--My own self,--His own self,--Their own selves<i>. So,</i> anciently, without an adjective: as, "A man shall have diffused his life, <i>his self</i>, and his whole concernments so far, that he can weep his sorrows with an other's eyes."--<i>South</i>. "Something valuable for <i>its self</i> without view to anything farther."--<i>Harris's Hermes</i>, p. 293. "That they would willingly, and of <i>their selves</i> endeavour to keep a perpetual chastity."--<i>Stat. Ed. VI. in Lowth's Gram.</i>, p. 26. "Why I should either <i>imploy my self</i> in that study or put others upon it."--<i>Walker's English</i> Particles<i>, p. xiv. "It is no matter whether you do it by your proctor, or</i> by <i>your self</i>."--<i>Ib.</i>, p. 96. The compound <i>oneself</i> is sometimes written in stead of the phrase <i>one's self</i>; but the latter is preferable, and more common. Even <i>his self</i>, when written as two words, may possibly be right in some instances; as,</p>
<pre>  "Scorn'd be the wretch that quits his genial bowl,
    His loves, his friendships, ev'n <i>his self</i>, resigns;
   Perverts the sacred instinct of his soul,
    And to a ducat's dirty sphere confines."
       --SHENSTONE: <i>Brit. Poets</i>, Vol. vii, p. 107.
</pre>
<p>OBS. 30.--In poetry, and even in some compositions not woven into regular numbers, the simple personal pronouns are not unfrequently used, for brevity's sake, in a reciprocal sense; that is, in stead of the compound personal pronouns, which are the proper reciprocals: as, "Wash <i>you</i>, make <i>you</i> clean."--<i>Isaiah</i>, i, 16. "I made me great works; I builded <i>me</i> houses; I planted <i>me</i> vineyards; I made <i>me</i> gardens and orchards."--<i>Ecclesiastes</i>, ii, 4. "Thou shalt surely clothe <i>thee</i> with them all as with an ornament, and bind them on <i>thee</i> as a bride doeth."--<i>Isaiah</i>, xlix, 18. Compare with these the more regular expression: "As a bridegroom decketh <i>himself</i> with ornaments, and as a bride adorneth <i>herself</i> with jewels."--<i>Isaiah</i>, lxi, 10. This phraseology is almost always preferable in prose; the other is a poetical license, or peculiarity: as,</p>
<pre>  "I turn <i>me</i> from the martial roar."--<i>Scott's L. L.</i>, p. 97.
</pre>
<pre>   "Hush <i>thee</i>, poor maiden, and be still."--<i>Ib.</i>, p. 110.
</pre>
<pre>   "Firmer he roots <i>him</i> the ruder it blow."--<i>Ib.</i>, p. 49.
</pre>
<p>OBS. 31.--To accommodate the writers of verse, the word <i>ever</i> is frequently contracted into <i>e'er</i>, pronounced like the monosyllable <i>air</i>. An easy extension of this license, gives us similar contractions of all the compound relative pronouns; as, <i>whoe'er</i> or <i>whosoe'er, whose'er</i> or <i>whosesoe'er, whome'er</i> or <i>whomsoe'er, whiche'er</i> or <i>whichsoe'er,</i> whate'er <i>or</i> whatsoe'er<i>. The character and properties of these compounds</i> are explained, perhaps sufficiently, in the observations upon the <i>classes</i> of pronouns. Some of them are commonly parsed as representing two cases at once; there being, in fact, an ellipsis of the noun, before or after them: as,</p>
<pre>  "Each art he prompts, each charm he can create,
   <i>Whate'er</i> he gives, <i>are given</i> for you to hate."--<i>Pope's Dunciad</i>.
</pre>
<p>OBS. 32.--For a form of parsing the double relative <i>what</i>, or its compound <i>whatever</i> or <i>whatsoever</i>, it is the custom of some teachers, to suggest equivalent words, and then proceed to explain these, in lieu of the word in question. This is the method of <i>Russell's Gram.</i>, p. 99; of <i>Merchants</i>, p. 110; of <i>Kirkham's</i>, p. 111; of <i>Gilbert's</i>, p. 92. But it should be remembered that equivalence of meaning is not sameness of grammatical construction; and, even if the construction be the same, to parse other equivalent words, is not really to parse the text that is given. A good parser, with the liberty to supply obvious ellipses, should know how to explain all good English <i>as it stands</i>; and for a teacher to pervert good English into false doctrine, must needs seem the very worst kind of ignorance. What can be more fantastical than the following etymology, or more absurd than the following directions for parsing? "<i>What</i> is compounded of <i>which that</i>. These words have been contracted and made to coalesce, a part of the orthography of both being still retained: <i>what--wh[ich--t]hat</i>; (<i>which-that</i>.) Anciently it appeared in the varying forms, <i>tha qua, qua tha, qu'tha, quthat, quhat, hwat</i>, and finally <i>what</i>."--<i>Kirkham's Gram.</i>, p. 111. This bald pedantry of "<i>tha qua, qua</i> tha<i>," was secretly borrowed from the grammatical speculations of William</i> S. Cardell:[217] the "<i>which-that</i>" notion contradicts it, and is partly of the borrower's own invention. If <i>what</i> is a compound, it was compounded more than a thousand years ago; and, of course, long before any part of the English language existed as such. King Alfred used it, as he found it, in the Saxon form of <i>hwæt</i>. The Scotch afterwards spelled it <i>quhat</i>. Our English grammarians have <i>improperly</i> called it a compound; and <i>Kirkham</i>, still more absurdly, calls the word <i>others</i> a compound, and <i>mine, thine,</i> ours, yours<i>, &amp;e. compounds.[218]</i></p>
<p>OBS. 33.--According to this gentleman's notion of things, there is, within the little circle of the word <i>what</i>, a very curious play of antecedent parts and parts relative--a dodging contra-dance of <i>which that</i> and <i>that</i> which<i>, with</i> things which<i>, and so forth. Thus: "When</i> what <i>is a</i> <i>compound relative</i> you must always parse it as <i>two words</i>; that is, you must parse the antecedent part <i>as a noun</i>, and give it case; the relative part you may <i>analyze</i> like any other relative, giving it a case likewise. Example: 'I will try <i>what</i> (that which) can be found in female delicacy.' Here <i>that</i>, the antecedent part of <i>what</i>, is in the obj. case, governed by the verb 'will try;' <i>which</i>, the relative part, is in the nom. case to 'can be found.' 'I have heard <i>what</i> (i.e. <i>that which</i>, or <i>the thing</i> which<i>) has been alleged.' "--</i>Kirkham's Gram.<i>, p. 111. Here, we sec, the</i> author's "<i>which-that</i>" becomes <i>that which</i>, or something else. But this is not a full view of his method. The following vile rigmarole is a further sample of that "<i>New Systematick Order of Parsing</i>," by virtue of which he so very complacently and successfully sets himself above all other grammarians: "'From <i>what</i> is recorded, he appears, &amp;c.' <i>What</i> is a comp. rel. pron. including both the antecedent and the relative, and is equivalent to <i>that which</i>, or the <i>thing which.--Thing</i>, the antecedent part of <i>what</i>, is a noun, the name of a thing--com. the name of a species--neuter gender, it has no sex--third person, spoken of--sing. number, it implies but one--and in the obj. case, it is the object of the relation expressed by the prep. 'from,' and gov. by it: RULE 31. (Repeat the Rule, and <i>every other Rule</i> to which I refer.) <i>Which</i>, the relative part of <i>what</i>, is a pronoun, a word used instead of a noun--relative, it relates to 'thing' for its antecedent--neut. gender, third person, sing, number, because the antecedent is with which it agrees, according to RULE 14. <i>Rel. pron</i>. &amp;c. <i>Which</i> is <i>in</i> the nom. case to the verb 'is recorded,' agreeably to RULE 15. <i>The relative is the nominative case to</i> the verb, when no nominative comes between it and the verb.<i>"--</i>Kirkham's Gram.<i>, p. 113.</i></p>
<p>OBS. 34.--The distinction which has been made by Murray and others, between etymological parsing and syntactical--or, between that exercise which simply classifies and describes the words of a sentence, and that which adds to this the principles of their construction--is rejected by Kirkham, and also by Ingersoll, Fuller, Smith, Sanborn, Mack, and some others, it being altogether irreconcilable with their several modes of confounding the two main parts of grammar. If such a distinction is serviceable, the want of it is one of the inherent faults of the schemes which they have adopted. But, since "grammar is the art of speaking and writing with <i>propriety</i>" who that really values clearness and accuracy of expression, can think the want of them excusable in <i>models</i> prescribed for the exercise of parsing? And is it not better to maintain the distinction above named, than to interlace our syntactical parsing with broken allusions to the definitions which pertain to etymology? If it is, this new mode of parsing, which Kirkham claims to have invented, and Smith pretends to have got from Germany, whatever boast may be made of it, is essentially defective and very immethodical.[219] This remark applies not merely to the forms above cited, respecting the pronoun <i>what</i>, but to the whole method of parsing adopted by the author of "<i>English Grammar in Familiar Lectures</i>."</p>
<p>OBS. 35.--The forms of etymological parsing which I have adopted, being designed to train the pupil, in the first place, by a succession of easy steps, to a rapid and accurate description of the several species of words, and a ready habit of fully defining the technical terms employed in such descriptions, will be found to differ more from the forms of syntactical parsing, than do those of perhaps any other grammarian. The definitions, which constitute so large a portion of the former, being omitted as soon as they are thoroughly learned, give place in the latter, to the facts and principles of syntax. Thus have we fullness in the one part, conciseness in the other, order and distinctness in both. The separation of etymology from syntax, however, though judiciously adopted by almost all grammarians, is in itself a mere matter of convenience. No one will pretend that these two parts of grammar are in their nature <i>totally</i> distinct and independent. Hence, though a due regard to method demands the maintenance of this ancient and still usual division of the subject, we not unfrequently, in treating of the classes and modifications of words, exhibit contingently some of the principles of their construction. This, however, is very different from a purposed blending of the two parts, than which nothing can be more unwise.</p>
<p>OBS. 36.--The great peculiarity of the pronoun <i>what</i>, or of its compound <i>whatever</i> or <i>whatsoever</i>, is a peculiarity of construction, rather than of etymology. Hence, in etymological parsing, it may be sufficient to notice it only as a relative, though the construction be double. It is in fact a relative; but it is one that reverses the order of the antecedent, whenever the noun is inserted with it. But as the noun is usually suppressed, and as the supplying of it is attended with an obvious difficulty, arising from the transposition, we cut the matter short, by declaring the word to have, as it appears to have, a double syntactical relation. Of the foregoing example, therefore--viz., "From <i>what</i> is recorded," &amp;c.,--a pupil of mine, in parsing <i>etymologically</i>, would say thus: "<i>What</i> is a relative pronoun, of the third person, singular number, neuter gender, and nominative case. 1. A pronoun is a word used in stead of a noun. 2. A relative pronoun is a pronoun that represents an antecedent word or phrase, and connects different clauses of a sentence. 3. The third person is that which denotes the person or thing merely spoken of. 4. The singular number is that which denotes but one. 5. The neuter gender is that which denotes things that are neither male nor female. 6. The nominative case is that form or state of a noun or pronoun, which denotes the subject of a verb." In parsing <i>syntactically</i>, he would say thus: "<i>What</i> is a double relative, including both antecedent and relative, being equivalent to <i>that which</i>. As <i>antecedent</i>, it is of the third person, singular number, neuter gender, and objective case; being governed by <i>from</i>; according to the rule which says, 'A Noun or a Pronoun made the object of a preposition, is goverved [sic--KTH] by it in the objective case.' Because the meaning is--<i>from what</i>. As <i>relative</i>, it is of the third person, singular number, neuter gender, and nominative case; being the subject of <i>is recorded</i>; according to the rule which says, 'A Noun or a Pronoun which is the subject of a finite verb, must be in the nominative case.' Because the meaning is--<i>what is recorded</i>."</p>
<p>OBS. 37.--The word <i>what</i>, when uttered independently as a mark of surprise, or as the prelude to an emphatic question which it does not ask, becomes an interjection; and, as such, is to be parsed merely as other interjections are parsed: as, "<i>What!</i> came the word of God out from you? or came it unto you only?"--<i>1 Cor.</i>, xiv, 36. "<i>What!</i> know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God?"--<i>1 Cor.</i>, vi, 19. "But <i>what!</i> is thy servant a dog, that he should do this great thing?"--<i>2 Kings</i>, viii, 13. "<i>What!</i> are you so ambitious of a man's good word, who perhaps in an hour's time shall curse himself to the pit of hell?"--<i>Collier's Antoninus</i>, p. 152.</p>

<p>"Every man has undoubtedly an inward perception of the celestial goodness by which he is quickened.

<p>"Simple thoughts are what arise naturally; what the occasion or the subject suggests unsought; and what, when once suggested, are easily apprehended by all. Refinement in writing, expresses a less natural and [less] obvious train of thought."--<i>Blair's Rhet.</i>, p. 184.</p>

<p>"I mean, when we are angry with our Maker. For against whom else is it that our displeasure is pointed, when we murmur at the distribution of things here, either because our own condition is less agreeable than we would have it, or because that of others is more prosperous than we imagine they deserve?"--<i>Archbishop Seeker</i>.</p>
<p>"Things cannot charge into the soul, or force us upon any opinions about them; they stand aloof and are quiet. It is our fancy that makes them operate and gall us; it is we that rate them, and give them their bulk and value."--<i>Collier's Antoninus</i>, p. 212.</p>
<p>"What is your opinion of truth, good-nature, and sobriety? Do any of these virtues stand in need of a good word; or are they the worse for a bad one? I hope a diamond will shine ne'er the less for a man's silence about the worth of it."--<i>Ib.</i>, p. 49.</p>

IMPROPRIETIES FOR CORRECTION.</p>
<p>ERRORS OF PRONOUNS.</p>
<p>LESSON I.--RELATIVES.</p>
<p>"At the same time that we attend to this pause, every appearance of sing-song and tone must be carefully guarded against."--<i>Murray's English</i> Reader<i>, p. xx.</i></p>
<p>[FORMULE.--Not proper, because the word <i>that</i> had not clearly the construction either of a pronoun or of a conjunction. But, according to Observation 18th, on the Classes of Pronouns, "The word <i>that</i>, or indeed any other word, should never be so used as to leave the part of speech uncertain." Therefore, the expression should be altered: thus, "<i>While</i> we attend to this pause, every appearance of <i>singsong</i> must be carefully <i>avoided</i>."]</p>
<p>"For thou shalt go to all that I shall send thee."--<i>Jeremiah</i>, i, 7; <i>Gurney's Obs.</i>, p. 223. "Ah! how happy would it have been for me, had I spent in retirement these twenty-three years that I have possessed my kingdom."--See <i>Sanborn's Gram.</i>, p. 242. "In the same manner that relative pronouns and their antecedents are usually parsed."--<i>Ib.</i>, p. 71. "Parse or mention all the other nouns in the parsing examples, in the same manner that you do the word in the form of parsing."--<i>Ib.</i>, p. 8. "The passive verb will always be of the person and number that the verb <i>be</i> is, of which it is in part composed."--<i>Ib.</i>, p. 53. "You have been taught that a verb must always be of the same person and number that its nominative is."--<i>Ib.</i>, p. 68. "A relative pronoun, also, must always be of the same person, number, and even gender that its antecedent is."--<i>Ib.</i>, p. 68. "The subsequent is always in the same case that the word is, which asks the question."--<i>Ib.</i>, p. 95. "<i>One</i> sometimes represents an antecedent noun in the same definite manner that personal pronouns do."--<i>Ib.</i>, p. 98. "The mind being carried forward to the time that an event happens, easily conceives it to be present."--<i>Ib.</i>, p. 107. "<i>Save</i> and <i>saving</i> are parsed in the same manner that <i>except</i> and <i>excepting</i> are."--<i>Ib.</i>, p. 123. "Adverbs describe, qualify, or modify the meaning of a verb in the same manner that adjectives do nouns."--<i>Ib.</i>, p. 16. "The third person singular of verbs, is formed in the same manner, that the plural number of nouns is."--<i>Ib.</i>, p. 41. "He saith further: 'that the apostles did not anew baptize such persons, that had been baptized with the baptism of John.'"--<i>Barclay's Works</i>, i, 292. "For we which live, are always delivered unto death for Jesus' sake."--<i>2 Cor.</i>, iv, 11. "For they, which believe in God, must be careful to maintain good works."--<i>Barclay's</i> Works<i>, i, 431. "Nor yet of those which teach things which they ought not,</i> for filthy lucre's sake."--<i>Ib.</i>, i, 435. "So as to hold such bound in heaven, whom they bind on earth, and such loosed in heaven, whom they loose on earth."--<i>Ib.</i>, i, 478. "Now, if it be an evil to do any thing out of strife; then such things that are seen so to be done, are they not to be avoided and forsaken?"--<i>Ib.</i>, i, 522. "All such who satisfy themselves not with the superficies of religion."--<i>Ib.</i>, ii, 23. "And he is the same in substance, what he was upon earth, both in spirit, soul and body."--<i>Ib.</i>, iii, 98. "And those that do not thus, are such, to whom the Church of Rome can have no charity."--<i>Ib.</i>, iii, 204. "Before his book he placeth a great list of that he accounts the blasphemous assertions of the Quakers."--<i>Ib.</i>, iii, 257. "And this is that he should have proved."--<i>Ib.</i>, iii, 322.

LESSON II.--DECLENSIONS.</p>
<p>"<i>Other</i> makes the plural <i>others</i>, when it is found without it's substantive."--<i>Priestley's Gram.</i>, p. 12.</p>
<p>[FORMULE.--Not proper, because the pronoun <i>it's</i> is written with an apostrophe. But, according to Observation 25th, on the Declensions of Pronouns, "The possessive case of pronouns should never be written with an apostrophe." Therefore, this apostrophe should be omitted; thus, "<i>Other</i> makes the plural <i>others</i>, when it is found without its substantive."]</p>
<p>"But <i>his, her's, our's, your's, their's</i>, have evidently the form of the possessive case."--<i>Lowth's Gram.</i>, p. 23. "To the Saxon possessive cases, <i>hire, ure, eower, hira</i>, (that is, <i>her's, our's, your's, their's</i>,) we have added the <i>s</i>, the characteristic of the possessive case of nouns."--<i>Ib.</i>, p. 23. "Upon the name of Jesus Christ our Lord, both their's and our's."--FRIENDS' BIBLE: <i>1 Cor.</i>, i, 2. "In this Place <i>His</i> Hand is clearly preferable either to Her's or It's."

"Second person: Sing. thou, thine, thee; Plur. ye or you,</i> your's, you."--<i>Ib.</i> "Third person: Sing. she, her's, her; Plur. they, their's, them."--<i>Ib.</i> "So shall ye serve strangers in a land that is not your's."--SCOTT ET AL.: <i>Jer.</i>, v, 19.

"<i>Whoever</i> and <i>Whichever</i> are thus declined. <i>Sing.</i> and <i>Plu. nom.</i> whoever, <i>poss.</i> whoseever, <i>obj.</i> whomever. <i>Sing.</i> and <i>Plu. nom.</i> whichever, <i>poss.</i> whoseever, <i>obj.</i> whichever."--<i>Cooper's Plain and Practical Gram.</i>, p. 38. "The compound personal pronouns are thus declined; <i>Sing. N.</i> Myself, <i>P.</i> my-own, <i>O.</i> myself; <i>Plur. N.</i> ourselves, <i>P.</i> our-own, <i>O.</i> ourselves. <i>Sing.

LESSON III.--MIXED.</p>
<p>"It is the boast of Americans, without distinction of parties, that their government is the most free and perfect, which exists on the earth."--<i>Dr.</i> Allen's Lectures<i>, p. 18.</i></p>
<p>[FORMULE.--Not proper, because the relative <i>which</i> is here intended to be taken in a restrictive sense. But, according to Observation 26th, on the Classes of Pronouns, (and others that follow it,) the word <i>who</i> or <i>which</i>, with a comma before it, does not usually limit the preceding term. Therefore, <i>which</i> should be <i>that</i>, and the comma should be omitted; thus,--"that their government is the most free and perfect <i>that</i> exists on the earth."]</p>
<p>"Children, who are dutiful to their parents, enjoy great prosperity."--<i>Sanborn's Gram.</i>, p. 69. "The scholar, who improves his time, sets an example worthy of imitation."--<i>Ib.</i>, p. 69.

"In the use of words and phrases, which in point of time relate to each other, a <i>due regard</i> to <i>that relation</i> should be <i>observed</i>."--<i>Ib.</i>, p. 146; see <i>L. Murray'</i>s Rule xiii. "The same observations, which have been made respecting the effect of the article and participle, appear to be applicable to the pronoun and participle."--<i>Murray's Gram.</i>, p. 193. "The reason that they have not the same use of them in reading, may be traced to the very defective and erroneous method, in which the art of reading is taught."--<i>Ib.</i>, p. 252. "Since the time that reason began to exert her powers, thought, during our waking hours, has been active in every breast, without a moment's suspension or pause."--<i>Murray's Key</i>, p. 271; <i>Merchant's Gram.</i>, p. 212. "In speaking of such who greatly delight in the same."--<i>Notes to Dunciad</i>, 177.

"In the next place I will explain several cases of nouns and pronouns which have not yet come under our notice."--<i>Kirkham's</i> Gram.<i>, p. 129. "Three natural distinctions of time are all which can</i> exist."--<i>Rail's Gram.</i>, p. 15. "We have exhibited such only as are obviously distinct; and which seem to be sufficient, and not more than sufficient."--<i>Murray's Gram.</i>, p. 68; <i>Hall's</i>, 14.

"Nature's postures are always easy; and which is more, nothing but your own will can put you out of them."--<i>Collier's Antoninus</i>, p. 197. "Therefore ought we to examine our ownselves, and prove our ownselves."--<i>Barclay's Works</i>, i, 426. "Certainly it had been much more natural, to have divided Active Verbs into <i>Immanent</i>, or such whose Action is terminated in it self, and <i>Transient</i>, or such whose Action is terminated in something without it self."--<i>Johnson's Gram. Com.</i>, p. 273. "This is such an advantage which no other lexicon will afford."--DR. TAYLOR: <i>in Pike's Lex.</i>, p. iv. "For these reasons, such liberties are taken in the Hebrew tongue with those words as are of the most general and frequent use."--<i>Pike's Heb. Lexicon</i>, p. 184. "At the same time that we object to the laws, which the antiquarian in language would impose upon us, we must enter our protest against those authors, who are too fond of innovations."--<i>Murray's Gram.</i>, Vol. i, p. 136.</p>

<p><br>
CHAPTER VI.--VERBS.</p>
<p>A Verb is a word that signifies <i>to be, to act</i>, or <i>to be acted upon</i>: as, I <i>am</i>, I <i>rule</i>, I <i>am ruled</i>; I <i>love</i>, thou <i>lovest</i>, he <i>loves</i>. VERBS are so called, from the Latin <i>Verbum</i>, a <i>Word</i>; because the verb is that word which most essentially contains what is said in any clause or sentence.</p>
<p>An English verb has four CHIEF TERMS, or PRINCIPAL PARTS, ever needful to be ascertained in the first place; namely, the <i>Present</i>, the <i>Preterit</i>, the <i>Imperfect Participle</i>, and the <i>Perfect Participle</i>. The <i>Present</i> is that form of the verb, which is the root of all the rest; the verb itself; or that simple term which we should look for in a dictionary: as, <i>be, act,</i> rule, love, defend, terminate<i>.</i></p>
<p>The <i>Preterit</i> is that simple form of the verb, which denotes time past; and which is always connected with some noun or pronoun, denoting the subject of the assertion: as, <i>I was, I acted, I ruled, I loved, I</i> defended<i>.</i></p>
<p>The <i>Imperfect Participle</i> is that which ends commonly[221] in <i>ing</i>, and implies a <i>continuance</i> of the being, action, or passion: as, <i>being,</i> acting, ruling, loving, defending, terminating<i>.</i></p>
<p>The <i>Perfect Participle</i> is that which ends commonly in <i>ed</i> or <i>en</i>, and implies a <i>completion</i> of the being, action, or passion: as, <i>been, acted,</i> ruled, loved<i>.</i></p>
<p>CLASSES.</p>
<p>Verbs are divided, with respect to their <i>form</i>, into four classes; <i>regular</i> and <i>irregular, redundant</i> and <i>defective</i>.</p>
<p>I. A <i>regular verb</i> is a verb that forms the preterit and the perfect participle by assuming <i>d</i> or <i>ed</i>; as, <i>love, loved, loving, loved</i>.</p>
<p>II. An <i>irregular verb</i> is a verb that does not form the preterit and the perfect participle by assuming <i>d</i> or <i>ed</i>; as, <i>see, saw, seeing, seen</i>.</p>
<p>III. A <i>redundant verb</i> is a verb that forms the preterit or the perfect participle in two or more ways, and so as to be both regular and irregular; as, <i>thrive, thrived</i> or <i>throve, thriving, thrived</i> or <i>thriven</i>.</p>
<p>IV. A <i>defective verb</i> is a verb that forms no participles, and is used in but few of the moods and tenses; as, <i>beware, ought, quoth</i>.</p>
<p>Verbs are divided again, with respect to their <i>signification</i>, into four classes; <i>active-transitive, active-intransitive, passive</i>, and <i>neuter</i>.</p>
<p>I. An <i>active-transitive</i> verb is a verb that expresses an action which has some person or thing for its object; as, "Cain <i>slew Abel</i>."--"Cassius <i>loved Brutus</i>."</p>
<p>II. An <i>active-intransitive</i> verb is a verb that expresses an action which has no person or thing for its object; as, "John <i>walks</i>."--"Jesus <i>wept</i>."</p>
<p>III. A. <i>passive verb</i> is a verb that represents its subject, or what the nominative expresses, as being acted upon; as, "I <i>am compelled</i>."--"Cæsar <i>was slain</i>."</p>
<p>IV. A <i>neuter verb</i> is a verb that expresses neither action nor passion, but simply being, or a state of being; as, "There <i>was</i> light."--"The babe <i>sleeps</i>."</p>
<p><br>
OBSERVATIONS.</p>
<p>OBS. 1.--So various have been the views of our grammarians, respecting this complex and most important part of speech, that almost every thing that is contained in any theory or distribution of the English verbs, may be considered a matter of opinion and of dispute. Nay, the essential nature of a verb, in Universal Grammar, has never yet been determined by any received definition that can be considered unobjectionable. The greatest and most acute philologists confess that a faultless definition of this part of speech, is difficult, if not impossible, to be formed. Horne Tooke, at the close of his Diversions of Purley, cites with contempt nearly a dozen different attempts at a definition, some Latin, some English, some French; then, with the abruptness of affected disgust, breaks off the catalogue and the conversation together, leaving his readers to guess, if they can, what he conceived a verb to be. He might have added some scores of others, and probably would have been as little satisfied with any one of them. A definition like that which is given above, may answer in some degree the purpose of distinction; but, after all, we must judge what is, and what is not a verb, chiefly from our own observation of the sense and use of words.[222]</p>
<p>OBS. 2.--Whether <i>participles</i> ought to be called verbs or not, is a question that has been much disputed, and is still variously decided; nor is it possible to settle it in any way not liable to some serious objections. The same may perhaps be said of all the forms called <i>infinitives</i>. If the essence of a verb be made to consist in affirmation, predication, or assertion, (as it is in many grammars,) neither infinitives nor participles can be reckoned verbs, without a manifest breach of the definition. Yet are the former almost universally treated as verbs, and by some as the only pure verbs; nor do all deny them this rank, who say that affirmation is <i>essential</i> to a verb. Participles, when unconnected with auxiliaries, are most commonly considered a separate part of speech; but in the formation of many of our moods and tenses, we take them as <i>constituent</i> parts of the verb<i>. If there is absurdity in this, there is more in</i> undertaking to avoid it; and the inconvenience should be submitted to, since it amounts to little or nothing in practice. With auxiliaries, then, participles <i>are verbs</i>: without auxiliaries, they are <i>not verbs</i>, but form a separate part of speech.</p>
<p>OBS. 3.--The number of verbs in our language, amounts unquestionably to four or five thousand; some say, (perhaps truly,) to eight thousand. All these, whatever be the number, are confessedly <i>regular</i> in their formation, except about two hundred. For, though the catalogues in our grammars give the number somewhat variously, all the irregular, redundant, and defective verbs, put together, are <i>commonly</i> reckoned fewer than two hundred. I admit, in all, two hundred and nineteen. The regular verbs, therefore, are vastly more numerous than those which deviate from the stated form. But, since many of the latter are words of very frequent occurrence, the irregular verbs appear exceedingly numerous in practice, and consequently require a great deal of attention. The defective verbs being very few, and most of these few being mere auxiliaries, which are never parsed separately, there is little occasion to treat them as a distinct class; though Murray and others have ranked them so, and perhaps it is best to follow their example. The redundant verbs, which are regular in one form and irregular in an other, being of course always found written either one way or the other, as each author chooses, may be, and commonly have been, referred in parsing to the class of regular or irregular verbs accordingly. But, as their number is considerable, and their character peculiar, there may be some advantage in making them a separate class. Besides, the definition of an irregular verb, as given in any of our grammars, seems to exclude all such as <i>may</i> form the preterit and the perfect participle by assuming <i>d</i> or <i>ed</i>.</p>
<p>OBS. 4.--In most grammars and dictionaries, verbs are divided, with respect to their signification, into three classes only; <i>active, passive</i>, and <i>neuter</i>. In such a division, the class of <i>active</i> verbs includes those only which are <i>active-transitive</i>, and all the <i>active-intransitive</i> verbs are called <i>neuter</i>. But, in the division adopted above, <i>active-intransitive</i> verbs are made a distinct class; and those only are regarded as neuter, which imply a state of existence without action. When, therefore, we speak of verbs without reference to their regimen, we may, if we please, apply the simple term active to all those which express <i>action</i>, whether <i>transitive</i> or <i>intransitive</i>. "We <i>act</i> whenever we <i>do</i> any thing; but we <i>may act</i> without <i>doing</i> any thing."--<i>Crabb's</i> Synonymes<i>.</i></p>
<p>OBS. 5.--Among the many English grammars in which verbs are divided, as above mentioned, into <i>active, passive</i>, and <i>neuter</i>, only, are those of the following writers: Lowth, Murray, Ainsworth, Alden, Allen, Alger, Bacon, Bicknell, Blair, Bullions, (at first,) Charles Adams, Bucke, Cobbett, Cobbin, Dilworth, A. Flint, Frost, (at first,) Greenleaf, Hall, Johnson,[223] Lennie, Picket, Pond, Sanborn, R. C. Smith, Rev. T. Smith, and Wright. These authors, and many more, agree, that, "A <i>verb neuter</i> expresses neither action nor passion, but being, or a state of being."--<i>L.</i> Murray<i>. Yet, according to their scheme, such words as</i> walk, run, fly, strive, struggle, wrestle, contend<i>, are verbs</i> neuter<i>. In view of this</i> palpable absurdity, I cannot but think it was a useful improvement upon the once popular scheme of English grammar, to make active-intransitive verbs a distinct class, and to apply the term <i>neuter</i> to those few only which accord with the foregoing definition. This had been done before the days of Lindley Murray, as may be seen in Buchanan's English Syntax, p. 56, and in the old British Grammar, p. 153, each published many years before the appearance of his work;[224] and it has often been done since, and is preferred even by many of the professed admirers and followers of Murray; as may be seen in the grammars of Comly, Fisk, Merchant, Kirkham, and others.</p>
<p>OBS. 6.--Murray himself quotes this improved distribution, and with some appearance of approbation; but strangely imagines it must needs be <i>inconvenient</i> in practice. Had he been a schoolmaster, he could hardly have so judged. He says, "Verbs have been distinguished by some writers, into the following kinds:--</p>
<p>"1st. <i>Active-transitive</i>, or those which denote an action that passes from the agent to some object: as, Cæsar conquered Pompey.</p>
<p>"2d. <i>Active-intransitive</i>, or those which express that kind of action, which has no effect upon any thing beyond itself: as, Cæsar walked.</p>
<p>"3d. <i>Passive</i>, or those which express, not action, but passion, whether pleasing or painful: as, Portia was loved; Pompey was conquered.</p>
<p>"4th. <i>Neuter</i>, or those which express an attribute that consists neither in action nor passion: as, Cæsar stood.</p>
<p>"This appears to be an orderly arrangement. But if the class of <i>active-intransitive</i> verbs were admitted, <i>it would rather perplex</i> than assist the learner: for the difference between verbs active and neuter, as transitive and intransitive is easy and obvious: but the difference between verbs absolutely neuter and [those which are] intransitively active, is not always clear. It is, indeed, often <i>very difficult</i>, if not impossible to be ascertained."--<i>Murray's Gram.</i>, 8vo, p. 60.[225]</p>
<p>OBS. 7.--The following note, from a book written on purpose to apply the principles of Murray's Grammar, and of Allen's, (the two best of the foregoing two dozen,) may serve as an offset to the reason above assigned for rejecting the class of active-intransitive verbs: "It is possible that some teachers may look upon the nice distinction here made, between the active <i>transitive</i> and the active <i>intransitive verbs</i>, as totally unnecessary. They may, perhaps, rank the latter with the neuter verbs. The author had his choice of difficulties: on the one hand, he was aware that his arrangement might not suit the views of the above-mentioned persons; and, on the other, he was so sensible of the inaccuracy of their system, and of its clashing with the definitions, as well as rules, laid down in almost every grammar, that he was unwilling to bring before the public a work containing so well-known and manifest an error. Of what use can Murray's definition of the <i>active</i> verb be, to one who endeavours to prove the propriety of thus assigning an epithet to the various parts of speech, in the course of parsing? He says, 'A verb active expresses an action, and necessarily implies an agent, and an object acted upon.' In the sentence, 'William hastens away,' the active intransitive verb <i>hastens</i> has indeed an <i>agent</i>, 'William,' but where is the <i>object</i>? Again, he says, 'Active verbs govern the objective case;' although it is clear it is not the <i>active</i> meaning of the verb which requires the objective case, but the <i>transitive</i>, and that only. He adds, 'A verb neuter expresses <i>neither</i> action, nor passion<i>, but being, or a state of being;' and the accuracy of</i> this definition is borne out by the assent of perhaps every other grammarian. If, with this clear and forcible definition before our eyes, we proceed to class <i>active</i> intransitive verbs with neuter verbs, and direct our pupils to prove such a classification by reciting Murray's definition of the <i>neuter</i> verb, we may indeed expect from a thinking pupil the remonstrance which was actually made to a teacher on that system, while parsing the verb '<i>to run</i>.' 'Sir,' asks the boy, 'does not <i>to run</i> imply action, for it always makes me perspire?'"--<i>Nixon's English Parser</i>, p. 9.</p>
<p>OBS. 8.--For the consideration of those classical scholars who may think we are bound by the authority of <i>general usage</i>, to adhere to the old division of verbs into active, passive, and neuter, it may be proper to say, that the distribution of the verbs in Latin, has been as much a matter of dispute among the great grammarians of that language, as has the distribution of English verbs, more recently, among ourselves; and often the points at issue were precisely the same.[226] To explain here the different views of the very old grammarians, as Charisius, Donatus, Servius, Priscian; or even to notice the opinions of later critics, as Sanctius, Scioppius, Vossius, Perizonius; might seem perhaps a needless departure from what the student of mere English grammar is concerned to know. The curious, however, may find interesting citations from all these authors, under the corresponding head, in some of our Latin grammars. See <i>Prat's Grammatica Latina</i>, 8vo, London, 1722. It is certain that the division of <i>active</i> verbs, into <i>transitive</i> and <i>intransitive</i>--or, (what is the same thing,) into "<i>absolute</i> and <i>transitive</i>"--or, into "<i>immanent</i> and <i>transient</i>"--is of a very ancient date. The notion of calling <i>passive</i> verbs <i>transitive</i>, when used in their ordinary and proper construction, as some now do, is, I think, a <i>modern</i> one, and no small error.</p>
<p>OBS. 9.--Dr. Adam's distribution of verbs, is apparently the same as the first part of Murray's; and his definitions are also in nearly the same words. But he adds, "The verb <i>Active</i> is also called <i>Transitive</i>, when the action <i>passeth over</i> to the object, or hath an effect on some other thing; as, <i>scribo literas</i>, I write letters: but when the action is confined within the agent, and <i>passeth not over</i> to any object, it is called <i>Intransitive</i>; as, <i>ambulo</i>, I walk; <i>curro</i>, I run: [fist] which are likewise called <i>Neuter Verbs</i>."--<i>Adam's Latin and English Gram.</i>, p. 79. But he had just before said, "A <i>Neuter</i> verb properly expresses neither action nor passion, but <i>simply the being, state, or condition</i> of things; as, <i>dormio</i>, I sleep; <i>sedeo</i>, I sit."--<i>Ibid.</i> Verbs of motion or action, then, must needs be as improperly called neuter, in Latin, as in English. Nor is this author's arrangement orderly in other respects; for he treats of "<i>Deponent</i> and <i>Common</i> Verbs," of "<i>Irregular</i> Verbs," of "<i>Defective</i> Verbs," and of "<i>Impersonal</i> Verbs," none of which had he mentioned in his distribution. Nor are the late revisers of his grammar any more methodical.</p>
<p>OBS. 10.--The division of our verbs into <i>active-transitive,</i> active-intransitive, passive<i>, and</i> neuter<i>, must be understood to have</i> reference not only to their <i>signification</i> as of themselves, but also to their <i>construction</i> with respect to the government of an objective word after them. The latter is in fact their most important distinction, though made <i>with reference</i> to a different part of speech. The classical scholar, too, being familiar with the forms of Latin and Greek verbs, will doubtless think it a convenience, to have the arrangement as nearly correspondent to those ancient forms, as the nature of our language will admit. This is perhaps the strongest argument for the recognition of the class of <i>passive</i> verbs <i>in English. Some grammarians, choosing to parse the passive</i> participle separately, reject this class of verbs altogether; and, forming their division of the rest with reference to the construction alone, make but two classes, <i>transitive</i> and <i>intransitive</i>. Such is the distribution adopted by C. Alexander, D. Adams, Bingham, Chandler, E. Cobb, Harrison, Nutting, and John Peirce; and supported also by some British writers, among whom are McCulloch and Grant. Such too was the distribution of Webster, in his Plain and Comprehensive Grammar, as published in 1800. He then taught: "We have no <i>passive</i> verb in the language; and those which are called <i>neuter</i> are mostly <i>active</i>."--Page 14. But subsequently, in his Philosophical, Abridged, and Improved Grammars, he recognized "a more natural and comprehensive division" of verbs, "<i>transitive, intransitive,</i> and passive<i>."--</i>Webster's Rudiments<i>, p. 20. This, in reality, differs but</i> little from the old division into <i>active, passive</i>, and <i>neuter</i>. In some grammars of recent date, as Churchill's, R. W. Bailey's, J. R. Brown's, Butler's, S. W. Clark's, Frazee's, Hart's, Hendrick's, Perley's, Pinneo's, Weld's, Wells's, Mulligan's, and the <i>improved</i> treatises of Bullions and Frost, verbs are said to be of <i>two</i> kinds only, <i>transitive</i> and <i>intransitive</i>; but these authors allow to transitive verbs a "passive form," or "passive voice,"--absurdly making all passive verbs transitive, and all neuters intransitive, as if <i>action</i> were expressed by both. For this most faulty classification, Dr. Bullions pretends the authority of "Mr. Webster;" and Frazee, that of "Webster, Bullions, and others."--<i>Frazee's Gram.</i>, Ster. Ed., p. 30. But if Dr. Webster ever taught the absurd doctrine <i>that passive verbs are transitive</i>, he has contradicted it far too much to have any weight in its favour.</p>
<p>OBS. 11.--Dalton makes only two classes; and these he will have to be <i>active</i> and <i>passive</i>: an arrangement for which he might have quoted Scaliger, Sanctius, and Scioppius. Ash and Coar recognize but two, which they call <i>active</i> and <i>neuter</i>. This was also the scheme of Bullions, in his Principles of E. Gram., 4th Edition, 1842. Priestley and Maunder have two, which they call <i>transitive</i> and <i>neuter</i>; but Maunder, like some named above, will have transitive verbs to be susceptible of an active and a passive voice, and Priestley virtually asserts the same. Cooper, Day, Davis, Hazen, Hiley, Webster, Wells, (in his 1st Edition,) and Wilcox. have three classes; <i>transitive, intransitive</i>, and <i>passive</i>. Sanders's Grammar has <i>three</i>; "<i>Transitive, Intransitive</i>, and <i>Neuter</i>;" and two voices, both <i>transitive!</i> Jaudon has four: <i>transitive, intransitive, auxiliary</i>, and <i>passive</i>. Burn has four; <i>active, passive, neuter</i>, and <i>substantive</i>. Cardell labours hard to prove that all verbs are <i>both active and</i> transitive<i>; and for this, had he desired their aid, he might have cited</i> several ancient authorities.[227] Cutler avers, "<i>All verbs are active</i>;" yet he divides them "into <i>active transitive, active intransitive</i>, and <i>participial verbs</i>."--<i>Grammar and Parser</i>, p. 31. Some grammarians, appearing to think all the foregoing modes of division useless, attempt nothing of the kind. William Ward, in 1765, rejected all such classification, but recognized three voices; "Active, Passive, and Middle; as, <i>I call, I am called, I am calling</i>." Farnum, in 1842, acknowledged the first two of these voices, but made no division of verbs into classes.</p>
<p>OBS. 12.--If we admit the class of <i>active-intransitive</i> verbs, that of verbs <i>neuter</i> will unquestionably be very small. And this refutes Murray's objection, that the learner will "<i>often</i>" be puzzled to know which is which. Nor can it be of any consequence, if he happen in some instances to decide wrong. To <i>be</i>, to <i>exist</i>, to <i>remain</i>, to <i>seem</i>, to <i>lie</i>, to <i>sleep</i>, to <i>rest</i>, to <i>belong</i>, to <i>appertain</i>, and perhaps a few more, may best be called <i>neuter</i>; though some grammarians, as may be inferred from what is said above, deny that there are any neuter verbs in any language. "Verba Neutra, ait Sanctius, nullo pacto esse possunt; quia, teste Aristotele, omnis motus, actio, vel passio, nihil medium est."--<i>Prat's Latin Gram.</i>, p. 117. John Grant, in his Institutes of Latin Grammar, recognizes in the verbs of that language the distinction which Murray supposes to be so "very difficult" in those of our own; and, without falling into the error of Sanctius, or of Lily,[228] respecting neuter verbs, judiciously confines the term to such as are neuter in reality.</p>
<p>OBS. 13.--Active-transitive verbs, in English, generally require, that the agent or doer of the action be expressed <i>before</i> them in the nominative case, and the object or receiver of the action, <i>after</i> them in the objective; as, "Cæsar <i>conquered</i> Pompey." Passive verbs, which are never primitives, but always derived from active-transitive verbs, (in order to form sentences of like import from natural opposites in voice and sense,) reverse this order, change the cases of the nouns, and denote that the subject, named before them, is affected by the action; while the agent follows, being introduced by the preposition <i>by</i>: as, "Pompey <i>was</i> conquered <i>by Cæsar." But, as our passive verb always consists of two or</i> more separable parts, this order is liable to be varied, especially in poetry; as,</p>
<pre>  "How many things <i>by season seasoned are</i>
   To their right praise and true perfection!"--<i>Shakspeare</i>.
</pre>
<pre>   "Experience <i>is by industry achieved</i>,
   And <i>perfected by</i> the swift <i>course</i> of time."--<i>Id.</i>
</pre>
<p>OBS. 14.--Most active verbs may be used either transitively or intransitively. Active verbs are transitive whenever there is any person or thing expressed or clearly implied on which the action terminates; as, "I <i>knew</i> him well, and every truant <i>knew</i>."--<i>Goldsmith</i>. When they do not govern such an object, they are intransitive, whatever may be their power on other occasions; as, "The grand elementary principles of pleasure, by which he <i>knows</i>, and <i>feels</i>, and <i>lives</i>, and <i>moves</i>."--<i>Wordsworth's</i> Pref.<i>, p. xxiii. "The Father</i> originates <i>and</i> elects<i>. The Son</i> mediates and <i>atones</i>. The Holy Spirit <i>regenerates</i> and <i>sanctifies</i>."--<i>Gurney's</i> Portable Evidences<i>, p. 66. "Spectators</i> remark<i>, judges</i> decide<i>, parties</i> <i>watch</i>."--<i>Blair's Rhet.</i>, p. 271. "In a sermon, a preacher <i>may explain,</i> demonstrate, infer, exhort, admonish, comfort<i>."--</i>Alexander's E. Gram.<i>,</i> p. 91.</p>
<p>OBS. 15.--Some verbs may be used in either an active or a neuter sense. In the sentence, "Here I rest," <i>rest</i> is a neuter verb; but in the sentence, "Here I rest my hopes," <i>rest</i> is an active-transitive verb, and governs <i>hopes</i>. And a few that are always active in a grammatical sense, as necessarily requiring an object after them, do not always indicate such an exertion of force as we commonly call <i>action</i>. Such perhaps are the verbs to <i>have</i>, to <i>possess</i>, to <i>owe</i>, to <i>cost</i>; as, "They <i>have</i> no wine."--"The house <i>has</i> a portico."--"The man <i>possesses</i> no real estate."--"A son <i>owes</i> help and honour to his father."--<i>Holyday</i>. "The picture <i>cost</i> a crown."--<i>Wright</i>, p. 181. Yet possibly even these may be sometimes rather active-intransitive; as, "I can bear my part; 'tis my occupation: <i>have</i> at it with you."--<i>Shakspeare</i>. "Kings <i>have</i> to deal with their neighbours."--<i>Bacon</i>. "She will let her instructions enter where folly now <i>possesses</i>."--<i>Shakspeare.</i></p>
<pre>  "Thou hast deserv'd more love than I can show;
   But 'tis thy fate to give, and mine to <i>owe</i>."--<i>Dryden</i>.
</pre>
<p>OBS. 16.--An active-intransitive verb, followed by a preposition and its object, will sometimes admit of being put into the passive form: the object of the preposition being assumed for the nominative, and the preposition itself being retained with the verb, as an adverb: as, (<i>Active</i>,) "They <i>laughed</i> at him."--(<i>Passive</i>,) "He <i>was laughed at</i>." "For some time the nonconformists <i>were connived at</i>."--<i>Robertson's America</i>, Vol. ii, p. 414. "Every man <i>shall be dealt</i> equitably with."--<i>Butler's Analogy</i>, p. 212. "If a church <i>would be looked up to</i>, it must stand high."--<i>Parker's</i> Idea<i>, p. 15.</i></p>
<p>OBS. 17.--In some instances, what is commonly considered the active form of the verb, is used in a passive sense; and, still oftener, as we have no other passive form that so well denotes continuance, we employ the participle in <i>ing</i> in that sense also: as, "I'll teach you all what's <i>owing</i> to your Queen."--<i>Dryden</i>. That is--what is <i>due</i>, or <i>owed</i>. "The books continue <i>selling</i>; i.e. <i>upon the sale</i>, or <i>to be</i> sold<i>."--</i>Priestley's Gram.<i>, p. 111. "So we say the brass is</i> forging<i>;</i> i.e. <i>at the forging</i>, or <i>in</i> [<i>being forged</i>."]--<i>Ib.</i> "They are to <i>blame</i>; i.e. to <i>be blamed.</i>"--<i>Ib.</i> Hence some grammarians seem to think, that in our language the distinction between active and passive verbs is of little consequence: "Mr. Grant, however, observes, p. 65, 'The component parts of the English verb, or name of action, are few, simple, and natural; they, consist of three words, as <i>plough, ploughing, ploughed</i>. Now these words, and their inflections, may be employed either actively or passively. Actively, 'They <i>plough</i> the fields; they <i>are ploughing</i> the fields; they <i>ploughed</i>, or <i>have ploughed</i>, the fields.' Passively, 'The fields <i>plough</i> well; the fields <i>are ploughing</i>; the fields <i>are ploughed</i>.' This passive use of the present tense and participle is, however, restricted to what he denominates 'verbs of <i>external, material</i>, or <i>mechanical</i> action<i>;' and not to be extended to verbs of</i> sensation <i>and</i> perception<i>;</i> e.g. <i>love, feel, see, &amp;c</i>."--<i>Nutting's Gram.</i>, p. 40.</p>
<p><br>
MODIFICATIONS.</p>
<p>Verbs have modifications of four kinds; namely, <i>Moods, Tenses, Persons</i> and <i>Numbers</i>.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>MOODS.</p>
<p>Moods [229] are different forms of the verb, each of which expresses the being, action, or passion, in some particular manner.</p>
<p>There are five moods; the <i>Infinitive</i>, the <i>Indicative</i>, the <i>Potential</i>, the <i>Subjunctive</i>, and the <i>Imperative</i>.</p>
<p>The <i>Infinitive mood</i> is that form of the verb, which expresses the being, action, or passion, in an unlimited manner, and without person or number: as, "To <i>die</i>,--to <i>sleep</i>;--To <i>sleep</i>!--perchance, to <i>dream!</i>"</p>
<p>The <i>Indicative mood</i> is that form of the verb, which simply indicates or declares a thing: as, I <i>write</i>; you <i>know</i>: or asks a question; as, "Do you <i>know?</i>"--"<i>Know</i> ye not?"</p>
<p>The <i>Potential mood</i> is that form of the verb which expresses the power, liberty, possibility, or necessity, of the being, action, or passion: as, "I <i>can walk</i>; he <i>may ride</i>; we <i>must go</i>."</p>
<p>The <i>Subjunctive mood</i> is that form of the verb, which represents the being, action, or passion, as conditional, doubtful, and contingent: as, "If thou <i>go</i>, see that thou <i>offend</i> not."--"See thou <i>do</i> it not."--<i>Rev.</i>, xix, 10.</p>
<p>The <i>Imperative mood</i> is that form of the verb which is used in commanding, exhorting, entreating, or permitting: as, "<i>Depart</i> thou."--"Be <i>comforted</i>."--"<i>Forgive</i> me."--"<i>Go</i> in peace."</p>
<p><br>
OBSERVATIONS.</p>
<p>OBS. 1.--The <i>Infinitive</i> mood is so called in opposition to the other moods, in which the verb is said to be <i>finite</i>. In all the other moods, the verb has a strict connexion, and necessary agreement in person and number, with some subject or nominative, expressed or understood; but the infinitive is the mere verb, without any such agreement, and has no power of completing sense with a noun. In the nature of things, however, all being, action, or passion, not contemplated abstractly as a <i>thing</i>, belongs to something that is, or acts, or is acted upon. Accordingly infinitives have, in most instances, a <i>reference</i> to some subject of this kind; though their grammatical dependence connects them more frequently with some other term. The infinitive mood, in English, is distinguished by the preposition to; which, with a few exceptions, immediately precedes it, and may be said to govern it. In dictionaries, and grammars, <i>to</i> is often used as a mere <i>index</i>, to distinguish verbs from the other parts of speech. But this little word has no more claim to be ranked as a part of the verb, than has the conjunction <i>if</i>, which is the sign of the subjunctive. It is the nature of a preposition, to show the relation of different things, thoughts, or words, to each other; and this "sign of the infinitive" may well be pursued separately as a preposition, since in most instances it manifestly shows the relation between the infinitive verb and some other term. Besides, by most of our grammarians, the present tense of the infinitive mood is declared to be the <i>radical form</i> of the verb; but this doctrine must be plainly untrue, upon the supposition that this tense is a compound.</p>
<p>OBS. 2.--The <i>Indicative</i> mood is so called because its chief use is, to <i>indicate</i>, or declare positively, whatever one wishes to say. It is that form of the verb, which we always employ when we affirm or deny any thing in a direct and independent manner. It is more frequently used, and has a greater number of tenses, than any other mood; and is also, in our language, the only one in which the principal verb is varied in termination. It is not, however, on all occasions, confined to its primary use; else it would be simply and only declarative. But we use it sometimes interrogatively, sometimes conditionally; and each of these uses is different from a simple declaration. Indeed, the difference between a question and an assertion is practically very great. Hence some of the old grammarians made the form of inquiry a separate mood, which they called the <i>Interrogative Mood</i>. But, as these different expressions are distinguished, not by any difference of form in the verb itself, but merely by a different order, choice, or delivery of the words, it has been found most convenient in practice, to treat them as one mood susceptible of different senses. So, in every conditional sentence, the <i>prot'asis</i>, or condition, differs considerably from the <i>apod'osis</i>, or principal clause, even where both are expressed as facts. Hence some of our modern grammarians, by the help of a few connectives, absurdly merge a great multitude of Indicative or Potential expressions in what they call the <i>Subjunctive Mood</i>. But here again it is better to refer still to the Indicative or Potential mood whatsoever has any proper sign of such mood, even though it occur in a dependent clause.</p>
<p>OBS. 3.--The <i>Potential</i> mood is so called because the leading idea expressed by it, is that of the <i>power</i> of performing some action. This mood is known by the signs <i>may, can, must, might, could, would</i>, and <i>should</i>. Some of these auxiliaries convey other ideas than that of power in the agent; but there is no occasion to explain them severally here. The potential mood, like the indicative, may be used in asking a question; as, "<i>Must</i> I <i>budge</i>? <i>must</i> I <i>observe</i> you? <i>must</i> I <i>stand</i> and <i>crouch</i> under your testy humour?"--<i>Shakspeare</i>. No question can be asked in any other mood than these two. By some grammarians, the potential mood has been included in the subjunctive, because its meaning is often expressed in Latin by what in that language is called the subjunctive. By others, it has been entirely rejected, because all its tenses are compound, and it has been thought the words could as well be parsed separately. Neither of these opinions is sufficiently prevalent, or sufficiently plausible, to deserve a laboured refutation. On the other hand, James White, in his Essay on the English Verb, (London, 1761,) divided this mood into the following five: "the <i>Elective</i>," denoted by <i>may</i> or <i>might</i>; "the <i>Potential</i>," by <i>can</i> or <i>could</i>; "the <i>Determinative</i>" by <i>would</i>; "the <i>Obligative</i>," by <i>should</i>; and "the <i>Compulsive</i>," by <i>must</i>. Such a distribution is needlessly minute. Most of these can as well be spared as those other "moods, <i>Interrogative, Optative, Promissive, Hortative, Precative</i>, &amp;c.", which Murray mentions only to reject. See his <i>Octavo Gram.</i>, p. 68.</p>
<p>OBS. 4.--The <i>Subjunctive</i> mood is so called because it is always <i>subjoined</i> to an other verb. It usually denotes some doubtful contingency, or some supposition contrary to fact. The manner of its dependence is commonly denoted by one of the following conjunctions; <i>if, that, though,</i> lest, unless<i>. The indicative and potential moods, in all their tenses, may</i> be used in the same dependent manner, to express any positive or potential condition; but this seems not to be a sufficient reason for considering them as parts of the subjunctive mood. In short, the idea of a "subjunctive mood in the indicative form," (which is adopted by Chandler, Frazee, Fisk, S. S. Greene, Comly, Ingersoll, R. C. Smith, Sanborn, Mack, Butler, Hart, Weld, Pinneo, and others,) is utterly inconsistent with any just notion of what a mood is; and the suggestion, which we frequently meet with, that the regular indicative or potential mood may be <i>thrown into the subjunctive</i> by merely prefixing a conjunction, is something worse than nonsense. Indeed, no mood can ever be made <i>a part of an other</i>, without the grossest confusion and absurdity. Yet, strange as it is, some celebrated authors, misled by an <i>if</i>, have tangled together three of them, producing such a snarl of tenses as never yet can have been understood without being thought ridiculous. See <i>Murray's Grammar</i>, and others that agree with his late editions.</p>
<p>OBS. 5.--In regard to the number and form of the tenses which should constitute the <i>subjunctive mood</i> in English, our grammarians are greatly at variance; and some, supposing its distinctive parts to be but elliptical forms of the indicative or the potential,[230] even deny the existence of such a mood altogether. On this point, the instructions published by Lindley Murray, however commended and copied, are most remarkably vague and inconsistent.[231] The early editions of his Grammar gave to this mood <i>six</i> tenses<i>, none of which had any of the personal inflections; consequently</i> there was, in all the tenses, <i>some difference</i> between it and the indicative. His later editions, on the contrary, make the subjunctive exactly like the indicative, except in the present tense, and in the choice of auxiliaries for the second-future. Both ways, he goes too far. And while at last he restricts the <i>distinctive form</i> of the subjunctive to narrower bounds than he ought, and argues against, "If thou <i>loved</i>, If thou <i>knew</i>," &amp;c., he gives to this mood not only the last five tenses of the indicative, but also all those of the potential, with its multiplied auxiliaries; alleging, "that as the indicative mood <i>is converted</i> into the subjunctive, by the expression of a condition, motive, wish, supposition, &amp;c.[232] being superadded to it, so the potential mood may, in like manner, <i>be turned into</i> the subjunctive."--<i>Octavo Gram.</i>, p. 82. According to this, the subjunctive mood of every regular verb embraces, in one voice, as many as one hundred and thirty-eight different expressions; and it may happen, that in one single tense a verb shall have no fewer than fifteen different forms in each person and number. Six times fifteen are ninety; and so many are the several phrases which now compose Murray's pluperfect tense of the subjunctive mood of the verb <i>to strow</i>--a tense which most grammarians very properly reject as needless! But this is not all. The scheme not only confounds the moods, and utterly overwhelms the learner with its multiplicity, but condemns as bad English what the author himself once adopted and taught for the imperfect tense of the subjunctive mood, "If thou <i>loved</i>, If thou <i>knew</i>," &amp;c., wherein he was sustained by Dr. Priestley, by Harrison, by Caleb Alexander, by John Burn, by Alexander Murray, the schoolmaster, and by others of high authority. Dr. Johnson, indeed, made the preterit subjunctive like the indicative; and this may have induced the author to change his plan, and inflect this part of the verb with <i>st</i>. But Dr. Alexander Murray, a greater linguist than either of them, very positively declares this to be wrong: "When such words as <i>if,</i> though, unless, except, whether<i>, and the like, are used before verbs, they</i> lose their terminations of <i>est, eth</i>, and <i>s</i>, in those persons which commonly have them. No speaker of good English, expressing himself conditionally, says, Though thou <i>fallest</i>, or Though he <i>falls</i>, but, Though thou <i>fall</i>, and Though he <i>fall</i>; nor, Though thou <i>camest</i>, but, Though, or although, thou <i>came</i>."--<i>History of European Languages</i>, Vol. i, p. 55.</p>
<p>OBS. 6.--Nothing is more important in the grammar of any language, than a knowledge of the <i>true forms</i> of its verbs. Nothing is more difficult in the grammar of our own, than to learn, in this instance and some others, what forms we ought to prefer. Yet some authors tell us, and Dr. Lowth among the rest, that our language is wonderfully simple and easy. Perhaps it is so. But do not its "simplicity and facility" appear greatest to those who know least about it?--i.e., least of its grammar, and least of its history? In citing a passage from the eighteenth chapter of Ezekiel, Lord Kames has taken the liberty to change the word <i>hath</i> to <i>have</i> seven times in one sentence. This he did, upon the supposition that the subjunctive mood has a perfect tense which differs from that of the indicative; and for such an idea he had the authority of Dr. Johnson's Grammar, and others. The sentence is this: "But if he <i>be</i> a robber, a shedder of blood; if he <i>have</i> eaten upon the mountains, and defiled his neighbour's wife; if he <i>have</i> oppressed the poor and needy, <i>have</i> spoiled by violence, <i>have</i> not restored the pledge, <i>have lift</i> up his eyes to idols, <i>have</i> given forth upon usury, and <i>have</i> taken increase: shall he live? he shall not live."--<i>Elements of Criticism</i>, Vol. ii, p. 261. Now, is this good English, or is it not? One might cite about half of our grammarians in favour of this reading, and the other half against it; with Murray, the most noted of all, first on one side, and then on the other. Similar puzzles may be presented concerning three or four other tenses, which are sometimes ascribed, and sometimes denied, to this mood. It seems to me, after much examination, that the subjunctive mood in English should have <i>two tenses</i>, and no more; the <i>present</i> and the <i>imperfect</i>. The present tense of this mood naturally implies contingency and futurity, while the imperfect here becomes an <i>aorist</i>, and serves to suppose a case as a mere supposition, a case contrary to fact. Consequently the foregoing sentence, if expressed by the subjunctive at all, ought to be written thus: "But if he <i>be</i> a robber, a shedder of blood; if he <i>eat</i> upon the mountains, and <i>defile</i> his neighbour's wife; if he <i>oppress</i> the poor and needy, <i>spoil</i> by violence, <i>restore</i> not the pledge, <i>lift</i> up his eyes to idols, <i>give</i> forth upon usury, and <i>take</i> increase; shall he live? he shall not live."</p>
<p>OBS. 7.--"Grammarians <i>generally</i> make a present and a past time under the subjunctive mode."--<i>Cobbett's E. Gram.</i>, ¶ 100. These are the tenses which are given to the subjunctive by <i>Blair</i>, in his "<i>Practical Grammar</i>." If any one will give to this mood <i>more</i> tenses than these, the five which are adopted by <i>Staniford</i>, are perhaps the least objectionable: namely, "<i>Present</i>, If thou love, or do love; <i>Imperfect</i>, If thou loved, or did love; <i>Perfect</i>, If thou have loved; <i>Pluperfect</i>, If thou had loved; <i>Future</i>, If thou should or would love."--<i>Staniford's Gram.</i>, p. 22. But there are no sufficient reasons for even this extension of its tenses.--Fisk, speaking of this mood, says: "Lowth restricts it entirely to the present tense."--"Uniformity on this point is highly desirable."--"On this subject, we adopt the opinion of Dr. Lowth."--<i>English Grammar</i> Simplified<i>, p. 70. His desire of uniformity he has both heralded and</i> backed by a palpable misstatement. The learned Doctor's subjunctive mood, in the second person singular, is this: "<i>Present time</i>. Thou love; AND, Thou <i>mayest</i> love. <i>Past time</i>. Thou <i>mightest</i> love; AND, Thou <i>couldst</i>, &amp;c. love; and have loved."--<i>Lowth's Gram.</i>, p. 38. But Fisk's subjunctive runs thus: "<i>Indic. form</i>, If thou lovest; <i>varied form</i>, If thou love." And again: "<i>Present tense</i>, If thou art, If thou be; <i>Imperfect tense</i>, If thou wast, If thou wert."--<i>Fisk's Grammar Simplified</i>, p. 70. His very definition of the subjunctive mood is illustrated <i>only by the indicative</i>; as, "If thou <i>walkest</i>."--"I will perform the operation, if he <i>desires</i> it."--<i>Ib.</i>, p. 69. Comly's subjunctive mood, except in some of his early editions, stands thus: "<i>Present tense</i>, If thou lovest; <i>Imperfect tense</i>, If thou lovedst or loved; <i>First future tense</i>, If thou (shalt) love."--<i>Eleventh Ed.</i>, p. 41. This author teaches, that the indicative or potential, when preceded by an <i>if</i>, "should be <i>parsed</i> in the subjunctive mood."--<i>Ib.</i>, p. 42. Of what is in fact the true subjunctive, he says: "<i>Some writers</i> use the singular number in the present tense of the subjunctive mood, without any variation; as, 'if I <i>love</i>, if thou <i>love</i>, if he <i>love</i>.' But this usage <i>must be ranked amongst the anomalies</i> of our language."--<i>Ib.</i>, p. 41. Cooper, in his pretended "<i>Abridgment of Murray's</i> Grammar, Philad.<i>, 1828," gave to the subjunctive mood the following form,</i> which contains all six of the tenses: "2d pers. If thou love, If thou do love, If thou loved, If thou did love, If thou have loved, If thou had loved, If thou shall (or will) love, If thou shall (or will) have loved." This is almost exactly what Murray at first adopted, and afterwards rejected; though it is probable, from the abridger's preface, that the latter was ignorant of this fact. Soon afterwards, a perusal of Dr. Wilson's Essay on Grammar dashed from the reverend gentleman's mind the whole of this fabric; and in his "Plain and Practical Grammar, Philad., 1831," he acknowledges but four moods, and concludes some pages of argument thus: "From the above considerations, it will appear <i>to every sound</i> grammarian<i>, that our language does not admit a subjunctive mode, at least,</i> separate and distinct from the indicative and potential."--<i>Cooper's New</i> Gram.<i>, p. 63.</i></p>
<p>OBS. 8.--The true <i>Subjunctive</i> mood, in English, is virtually rejected by some later grammarians, who nevertheless acknowledge under that name a greater number and variety of forms than have ever been claimed for it in any other tongue. All that is peculiar to the Subjunctive, all that should constitute it a distinct mood, they represent as an archaism, an obsolete or antiquated mode of expression, while they willingly give to it every form of both the indicative and the potential, the two other moods which sometimes follow an <i>if</i>. Thus Wells, in his strange entanglement of the moods, not only gives to the subjunctive, as well as to the indicative, a "Simple" or "Common Form," and a "Potential Form;" not only recognizes in each an "Auxiliary Form," and a "Progressive Form;" but encumbers the whole with distinctions of style,--with what he calls the "Common Style," and the "Ancient Style;" or the "Solemn Style," and the "Familiar Style:" yet, after all, his own example of the Subjunctive, "Take heed, lest any man <i>deceive</i> you," is obviously different from all these, and not explainable under any of his paradigms! Nor is it truly consonant with any part of his theory, which is this: "The subjunctive of all verbs except <i>be</i>, takes <i>the same form as the indicative</i>. Good writers were formerly much accustomed to <i>drop</i> the personal termination in the <i>subjunctive present</i>, and write 'If he <i>have</i>,' 'If he <i>deny</i>,' etc., for 'If he <i>has</i>,' 'If he <i>denies</i>,' etc.; but this termination is now <i>generally retained</i>, unless <i>an auxiliary is understood</i>. Thus, 'If he <i>hear</i>,' may properly be used for 'If he <i>shall hear'</i> or 'If he <i>should hear</i>,' but not for 'If he <i>hears</i>.'"--<i>Wells's School Gram.</i>, 1st Ed., p. 83; 3d Ed., p. 87. Now every position here taken is demonstrably absurd. How could "good writers" indite "much" bad English by <i>dropping</i> from the subjunctive an indicative ending which never belonged to it? And how can a needless "auxiliary" be "<i>understood</i>," on the principle of equivalence, where, by awkwardly changing a mood or tense, it only helps some grammatical theorist to convert good English into bad, or to pervert a text? The phrases above may all be right, or all be wrong, according to the correctness or incorrectness of their application: when each is used as best it may be, there is no exact equivalence. And this is true of half a dozen more of the same sort; as, "If he <i>does hear</i>,"--"If he <i>do hear</i>,"--"If he is <i>hearing</i>,"--"If he <i>be hearing</i>,"--"If he <i>shall be hearing</i>,"--"If he <i>should be hearing</i>."</p>
<p>OBS. 9.--Similar to Wells's, are the subjunctive forms of Allen H. Weld. Mistaking <i>annex</i> to signify <i>prefix</i>, this author teaches thus: "ANNEX <i>if, though, unless, suppose, admit, grant, allow</i>, or any word implying a <i>condition</i>, to each tense of the <i>Indicative and Potential modes</i>, to form the subjunctive; as, If thou lovest or love. If he loves, or love. Formerly it was customary to <i>omit the terminations</i> in the second and third persons of the present tense of the Subjunctive mode. But now the terminations are <i>generally retained</i>, except when the ellipsis of <i>shall</i> or <i>should</i> is implied; as, If he obey, i. e., if he <i>shall</i>, or <i>should</i> obey."--<i>Weld's</i> Grammar, Abridged Edition<i>, p. 71. Again: "</i>In general<i>, the form of the</i> verb in the Subjunctive, <i>is the same as that of the Indicative</i>; but an <i>elliptical form</i> in the second and third <i>person</i> [persona] singular, is used in the following instances: (1.) <i>Future contingency</i> is expressed by the <i>omission of the Indicative termination</i>; as, If he go, for, if he <i>shall</i> go. Though he slay me, i.e., though he <i>should</i> slay me. (2.) <i>Lest</i> and <i>that</i> annexed to a command are followed by the <i>elliptical</i> form <i>of the Subjunctive; as, Love not sleep [,] lest thou</i> come <i>to</i> poverty. (3.) <i>If</i> with <i>but</i> following it, when futurity is denoted, requires the <i>elliptical form</i>; as, If he <i>do</i> but <i>touch</i> the hills, they shall smoke."--<i>Ib.</i>, p. 126. As for this scheme, errors and inconsistencies mark every part of it. First, the rule for forming the subjunctive is false, and is plainly contradicted <i>by all that is true</i> in the examples: "<i>If thou love</i>," or, "<i>If he love</i>" contains not the form of the indicative. Secondly, no terminations have ever been "generally" omitted from, or retained in, the form of the subjunctive present; because that part of the mood, as commonly exhibited, is well known to be made of the <i>radical verb</i>, without inflection. One might as well talk of suffixes for the imperative, "<i>Love</i> thou," or "<i>Do</i> thou love." Thirdly, <i>shall</i> or <i>should</i> can never be really implied in the subjunctive present; because the supposed ellipsis, needless and unexampled, would change the tense, the mood, and commonly also the meaning. "If he <i>shall</i>," properly implies a condition of <i>future certainty</i>; "If he <i>should</i>," a supposition of <i>duty</i>: the true subjunctive suggests neither of these. Fourthly, "the ellipsis of <i>shall</i>, or <i>should</i>," is most absurdly called above, "the omission of the <i>Indicative termination</i>." Fifthly, it is very strangely supposed, that to omit what pertains to the <i>indicative</i> or the <i>potential</i> mood, will produce an "elliptical form of <i>the Subjunctive</i>." Sixthly, such examples as the last, "If he <i>do</i> but <i>touch</i> the hills," having the auxiliary <i>do</i> not inflected as in the indicative, disprove the whole theory.</p>
<p>OBS. 10.--In J. B. Chandler's grammars, are taken nearly the same views of the "Subjunctive or Conditional Mood," that have just been noticed. "This mood," we are told, "is <i>only</i> the indicative <i>or</i> potential mood, with the word <i>if</i> placed before the nominative case."--<i>Gram. of</i> 1821, p. 48; <i>Gram. of</i> 1847, p. 73. Yet, of even <i>this</i>, the author has said, in the former edition, "It would, perhaps, be <i>better to abolish the use</i> of the subjunctive mood entirely. <i>Its use</i> is a continual source of dispute among grammarians, and of perplexity to scholars."--Page 33. The suppositive verb <i>were</i>,--(as, "<i>Were</i> I a king,"--"If I <i>were</i> a king,"--) which this author formerly rejected, preferring <i>was</i>, is now, after six and twenty years, replaced in his own examples; and yet he still attempts to <i>disgrace</i> it<i>, by falsely representing it as being only "the indicative</i> plural<i>"</i> very grossly misapplied! See <i>Chandler's Common School Gram.</i>, p. 77.</p>
<p>OBS. 11.--The <i>Imperative</i> mood is so called because it is chiefly used in <i>commanding</i>. It is that brief form of the verb, by which we directly urge upon others our claims and wishes. But the nature of this urging varies according to the relation of the parties. We command inferiors; exhort equals; entreat superiors; permit whom we will;--and all by this same imperative form of the verb. In answer to a request, the imperative implies nothing more than permission. The will of a superior may also be urged imperatively by the indicative, future. This form is particularly common in solemn prohibitions; as, "Thou <i>shalt not kill</i>. * * * Thou <i>shalt not</i> steal<i>."--</i>Exodus<i>, xx, 13 and 15. Of the ten commandments, eight are</i> negative, and all these are indicative in form. The other two are in the imperative mood: "<i>Remember</i> the sabbath day to keep it holy. <i>Honour</i> thy father and thy mother."--<i>Ib.</i> But the imperative form may also be negative: as, "<i>Touch not; taste not; handle not</i>."--<i>Colossians</i>, ii, 21.</p>
<p><br>
TENSES.</p>
<p>Tenses are those modifications of the verb, which distinguish time. There are six tenses; the <i>Present</i>, the <i>Imperfect</i>, the <i>Perfect</i>, the <i>Pluperfect</i>, the <i>First-future</i>, and the <i>Second-future</i>.</p>
<p>The <i>Present tense</i> is that which expresses what <i>now exists</i>, or <i>is</i> taking <i>place: as, "I</i> hear <i>a noise; somebody</i> is coming<i>."</i></p>
<p>The <i>Imperfect tense</i> is that which expresses what <i>took place</i>, or <i>was</i> occurring<i>, in time fully past: as, "I</i> saw <i>him yesterday, and</i> hailed him as he <i>was passing</i>."</p>
<p>The <i>Perfect tense</i> is that which expresses what <i>has taken</i> place, within some period of time not yet fully past: as, "I <i>have seen</i> him to-day; something <i>must have detained</i> him."</p>
<p>The <i>Pluperfect tense</i> is that which expresses what <i>had taken</i> place, at some past time mentioned: as, "I <i>had seen</i> him, when I met you."</p>
<p>The <i>First-future tense</i> is that which expresses what <i>will take</i> place hereafter: as, "I <i>shall see</i> him again, and I <i>will inform</i> him."</p>
<p>The <i>Second-future tense</i> is that which expresses what <i>will have taken</i> place, at some future time mentioned: as, "I <i>shall have seen</i> him by tomorrow noon."</p>
<p>OBSERVATIONS.</p>
<p>OBS. 1.--The terms here defined are the names usually given to those parts of the verb to which they are in this work applied; and though some of them are not so strictly appropriate as scientific names ought to be, it is thought inexpedient to change them. In many old grammars, and even in the early editions of Murray, the three past tenses are called the <i>Preterimperfect, Preterperfect</i>, and <i>Preterpluperfect</i>. From these names, the term <i>Preter</i>, (which is from the Latin preposition <i>præter</i>, meaning <i>beside, beyond</i>, or <i>past</i>,) has been well dropped for the sake of brevity.[233]</p>
<p>OBS. 2.--The distinctive epithet <i>Imperfect</i>, or <i>Preterimperfect</i>, appears to have been much less accurately employed by the explainers of our language, than it was by the Latin grammarians from whom it was borrowed. That tense which passes in our schools for the <i>Imperfect</i>, (as, I <i>slept,</i> did sleep<i>, or</i> was sleeping<i>,) is in fact, so far as the indicative mood</i> is concerned, <i>more completely past</i>, than that which we call the <i>Perfect</i>. Murray indeed has attempted to show that the name is right; and, for the sake of consistency, one could wish he had succeeded. But every scholar must observe, that the simple preterit, which is the first form of this tense, and is never found in any other, as often as the sentence is declarative, tells what <i>happened</i> within some period of time <i>fully past</i>, as <i>last week, last year</i>; whereas the perfect tense is used to express what <i>has happened</i> within some period of time <i>not yet fully past</i>, as <i>this week, this year</i>. As to the completeness of the action, there is no difference; for what <i>has been done</i> to-day, is as <i>completely done</i>, as what <i>was achieved</i> a year ago. Hence it is obvious that the term <i>Imperfect</i> has no other applicability to the English tense so called, than what it may have derived from the participle in <i>ing</i>, which we use in translating the Latin imperfect tense: as, <i>Dormiebam, I was sleeping;</i> Legebam, I was reading; Docebam, I was teaching<i>. And if for this reason</i> the whole English tense, with all its variety of forms in the different moods, "may, with propriety, be denominated <i>imperfect</i>;" surely, the participle itself should be so denominated <i>a fortiori</i>: for it always conveys this same idea, of "<i>action not finished</i>," be the tense of its accompanying auxiliary what it may.</p>
<p>OBS. 3.--The tenses do not all express time with equal precision; nor can the whole number in any language supersede the necessity of adverbs of time, much less of dates, and of nouns that express periods of duration. The tenses of the indicative mood, are the most definite; and, for this reason, as well as for some others, the explanations of all these modifications of the verb, are made with particular reference to that mood. Some suppose the compound or participial form, as <i>I am writing</i>, to be more definite in time, than the simple form, as <i>I write</i>, or the emphatic form, as <i>I do write</i>; and accordingly they divide all the tenses into <i>Indefinite</i> and <i>Definite</i>. Of this division Dr. Webster seems to claim the invention; for he gravely accuses Murray of copying it unjustly from him, though the latter acknowledges in a note upon his text, it "is, <i>in</i> part<i>, taken from Webster's Grammar."--</i>Murray's Octavo Gram.<i>, p. 73. The</i> distribution, as it stands in either work, is not worth quarrelling about: it is evidently more cumbersome than useful. Nor, after all, is it true that the compound form is more definite in time than the other. For example; "Dionysius, tyrant of Syracuse, <i>was always betraying</i> his unhappiness."--<i>Art of Thinking</i>, p. 123. Now, if <i>was betraying</i> were a more definite tense than <i>betrayed</i>, surely the adverb "<i>always</i>" would require the latter, rather than the former.</p>
<p>OBS. 4.--The present tense, of the indicative mood, expresses not only what is now actually going on, but general truths, and customary actions: as, "Vice <i>produces</i> misery."--"He <i>hastens</i> to repent, who <i>gives</i> sentence quickly."--<i>Grant's Lat. Gram.</i>, p. 71. "Among the Parthians, the signal <i>is given</i> by the drum, and not by the trumpet."--<i>Justin</i>. Deceased authors may be spoken of in the present tense, because they seem to live in their works; as, "Seneca <i>reasons</i> and <i>moralizes</i> well."--<i>Murray</i>. "Women <i>talk</i> better than men, from the superior shape of their tongues: an ancient writer <i>speaks</i> of their loquacity three thousand years ago."--<i>Gardiner's Music of Nature</i>, p. 27.</p>
<p>OBS. 5.--The text, John, viii, 58, "Before Abraham <i>was</i>, I <i>am</i>," is a literal Grecism, and not to be cited as an example of pure English: our idiom would seem to require, "Before Abraham <i>was</i>, I <i>existed</i>." In animated narrative, however, the present tense is often substituted for the past, by the figure <i>enallage</i>. In such cases, past tenses and present may occur together; because the latter are used merely to bring past events more vividly before us: as, "Ulysses <i>wakes</i>, not knowing where he <i>was</i>."--<i>Pope</i>. "The dictator <i>flies</i> forward to the cavalry, beseeching them to dismount from their horses. They <i>obeyed</i>; they <i>dismount, rush</i> onward, and for vancouriers <i>show</i> their bucklers."--<i>Livy</i>. On this principle, perhaps, the following couplet, which Murray condemns as bad English, may be justified:--</p>
<pre>  "Him portion'd maids, apprentic'd orphans blest,
   The young who <i>labour</i>, and the old who <i>rest</i>."
       See <i>Murray's Key</i>, R. 13.
</pre>
<p>OBS. 6.--The present tense of the subjunctive mood, and that of the indicative when preceded by <i>as soon as, after, before, till</i>, or <i>when</i>, is generally used with reference to future time; as, "If he <i>ask</i> a fish, will he give him a serpent?"--<i>Matt.</i>, vii, 10. "If I <i>will</i> that he <i>tarry</i> till I <i>come</i>, what is that to thee? Follow thou me."--<i>John</i>, xxi, 22. "When he <i>arrives</i>, I will send for you." The imperative mood has but one tense, and that is always present with regard to the giving of the command; though what is commanded, must be done in the future, if done at all. So the subjunctive may convey a present supposition of what the will of an other may make uncertain: as, "If thou <i>count</i> me therefore a partner, <i>receive</i> him as myself."--<i>St. Paul to Philemon</i>, 17. The perfect indicative, like the present, is sometimes used with reference to time that is relatively future; as, "He will be fatigued before he <i>has walked</i> a mile."--"My lips shall utter praise, when thou <i>hast taught</i> me thy statutes."--<i>Psalms</i>, cxix, 171. "Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all that <i>are</i> in the graves, shall hear his voice, and shall come forth; they that <i>have done</i> good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that <i>have done</i> evil, unto the resurrection of damnation."--<i>John</i>, v, 28.</p>
<p>OBS. 7.--What is called the <i>present</i> infinitive, can scarcely be said to express any particular time.[234] It is usually dependent on an other verb, and therefore relative in time. It may be connected with any tense of any mood: as, "I <i>intend to do</i> it; I <i>intended to do</i> it; I <i>have intended to</i> do <i>it; I</i> had intended to do <i>it;" &amp;c. For want of a better mode of</i> expression, we often use the infinitive to denote futurity, especially when it seems to be taken adjectively; as, "The time <i>to come</i>,"--"The world <i>to</i> come<i>,"--"Rapture yet</i> to be<i>." This, sometimes with the awkward addition</i> of <i>about</i>, is the only substitute we have for the Latin future participle in <i>rus</i>, as <i>venturus, to come</i>, or <i>about to come</i>. This phraseology, according to Horne Tooke, (see <i>Diversions of Purley</i>, Vol. ii, p. 457,) is no fitter than that of our ancestors, who for this purpose used the same preposition, but put the participle in <i>ing</i> after it, in lieu of the radical verb, which we choose to employ: as, "Generacions of eddris, who shewide to you to fle fro wraththe <i>to comynge?</i>"--<i>Matt.</i>, iii, 7. Common Version: "O generation of vipers! who hath warned you to flee from the wrath <i>to come</i>?" "Art thou that art <i>to comynge</i>, ether abiden we another?"--<i>Matt.</i>, xi, 3. Common Version: "Art thou he that <i>should come</i>, or do we look for another?" "Sotheli there the ship was <i>to puttyng out</i> the charge."--<i>Dedis</i>, xxi, 3. Common Version: "For there the ship was <i>to</i> unlade <i>her burden."--</i>Acts<i>, xxi, 3. Churchill, after changing the names</i> of the two infinitive tenses to "<i>Future imperfect</i>" and "<i>Future</i> perfect<i>," adds the following note: "The tenses of the infinitive mood are</i> usually termed <i>present</i> and <i>preterperfect</i>: but this is certainly improper; for they are so completely future, that what is called the present tense of the infinitive mood is often employed simply to express futurity; as, 'The life <i>to come</i>.'"--<i>New Gram.</i>, p. 249.</p>
<p>OBS. 8.--The pluperfect tense, when used conditionally, in stead of expressing what actually <i>had taken place</i> at a past time, almost always implies that the action thus supposed <i>never was performed</i>; on the contrary, if the supposition be made in a <i>negative form</i>, it suggests that the event <i>had occurred</i>: as, "Lord, if thou <i>hadst been here</i>, my brother <i>had not died</i>."--<i>John</i>, xi, 32. "If I <i>had not come</i> and spoken unto them, they <i>had not had</i> sin; but now they have no cloak for their sin."--<i>John</i>, xv, 22. "If thou <i>hadst known</i>, even thou, at least in this thy day, the things which belong unto thy peace! But now they are hid from thine eyes."--<i>Luke</i>, xix, 42. The supposition is sometimes indicated by a mere transposition of the verb and its subject; in which case, the conjunction <i>if</i> is omitted; as, "<i>Had ye believed</i> Moses, ye would have believed me."--<i>John</i>, v, 46.</p>
<pre>  "<i>Had I but fought</i> as wont, one thrust
   <i>Had laid</i> De Wilton in the dust."--<i>Scott</i>
</pre>
<p>OBS. 9.--In the language of prophecy we find the past tenses very often substituted for the future, especially when the prediction is remarkably clear and specific. Man is a creature of present knowledge only; but it is certain, that He who sees the end from the beginning, has sometimes revealed to him, and by him, things deep in futurity. Thus the sacred seer who is esteemed the most eloquent of the ancient prophets, more than <i>seven</i> hundred years <i>before the events occurred, spoke of the vicarious</i> sufferings of Christ as of things already past, and even then described them in the phraseology of historical facts: "Surely he <i>hath borne</i> our griefs, <i>and carried</i> our sorrows: yet we <i>did esteem</i> him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted. But he <i>was wounded</i> for our transgressions; he <i>was bruised</i> for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace <i>was</i> upon him; and by his stripes we are healed."--<i>Isaiah</i>, liii, 4 and 5. Multiplied instances of a similar application of the past tenses to future events, occur in the Bible, especially in the writings of this prophet.</p>

PERSONS AND NUMBERS.</p>
<p><br>
The person and number of a verb are those modifications in which it agrees with its subject or nominative.</p>
<p>In each number, there are three persons; and in each person, two numbers: thus,</p>
<p><i>Singular.</i> <i>Plural.</i> 1st per. I love, 1st per. We love, 2d per. Thou lovest, 2d per. You love, 3d per. He loves; 3d per. They love.</p>
<p>Definitions universally applicable have already been given of all these things; it is therefore unnecessary to define them again in this place.</p>
<p>Where the verb is varied, the second person singular is regularly formed by adding <i>st</i> or <i>est</i> to the first person; and the third person singular, in like manner, by adding <i>s</i> or <i>es</i>: as, I <i>see</i>, thou <i>seest</i>, he <i>sees</i>; I <i>give</i>, thou <i>givest</i>, he <i>gives</i>; I <i>go</i>, thou <i>goest</i>, he <i>goes</i>; I <i>fly</i>, thou <i>fliest</i>, he <i>flies</i>; I <i>vex</i>, thou <i>vexest</i>, he <i>vexes</i>; I <i>lose</i>, thou <i>losest</i>, he <i>loses.</i></p>
<p>Where the verb is not varied to denote its person and number, these properties are inferred from its subject or nominative: as, If I <i>love</i>, if thou <i>love</i>, if he <i>love</i>; if we <i>love</i>, if you <i>love</i>, if they <i>love</i>.</p>
<p><br>
OBSERVATIONS.</p>
<p>OBS. 1.--It is considered a principle of Universal Grammar, that a finite verb must agree with its subject or nominative in person and number. Upon this principle, we ascribe to every such verb the person and number of the nominative word, whether the verb itself be literally modified by the relation or not. The doctrine must be constantly taught and observed, in every language in which the verbs have <i>any variations</i> of this kind. But suppose an instance, of a language in which all the verbs were entirely destitute of such inflections; the principle, as regards that language, must drop. Finite verbs, in such a case, would still relate to their subjects, or nominatives, agreeably to the sense; but they would certainly be rendered incapable of adding to this relation any agreement or disagreement. So the concords which belong to adjectives and participles in Latin and Greek, are rejected in English, and there remains to these parts of speech nothing but a simple relation to their nouns according to the sense. And by the fashionable substitution of <i>you</i> for <i>thou</i>, the concord of English verbs with their nominatives, is made to depend, in common practice, on little more than one single terminational <i>s</i>, which is used to mark one person of one number of one tense of one mood of each verb. So near does this practice bring us to the dropping of what is yet called a universal principle of grammar.[235]</p>
<p>OBS. 2.--In most languages, there are in each tense, through all the moods of every verb, six different terminations to distinguish the different persons and numbers. This will be well understood by every one who has ever glanced at the verbs as exhibited in any Latin, Greek, French, Spanish, or Italian grammar. To explain it to others, a brief example shall be given: (with the remark, that the Latin pronouns, here inserted, are seldom expressed, except for emphasis:) "<i>Ego amo</i>, I love; <i>Tu amas</i>, Thou lovest; <i>Ille amat</i>, He loves; <i>Nos amamus</i>, We love; <i>Vos amatis</i>, You love; <i>Illi amant</i>, They love." Hence it may be perceived, that the paucity of variations in the English verb, is a very striking peculiarity of our language. Whether we are gainers or losers by this simplicity, is a question for learned idleness to discuss. The common people who speak English, have far less inclination to add new endings to our verbs, than to drop or avoid all the remains of the old. Lowth and Murray tell us, "This scanty provision of terminations <i>is sufficient</i> for all the purposes of discourse;" and that, "<i>For this reason</i>, the plural termination <i>en</i>, (they <i>loven</i>, they <i>weren</i>,) formerly in use, was laid aside as <i>unnecessary</i>, and has long been obsolete."--<i>Lowth's Gram.</i>, p. 31; <i>Murray's</i>, 63.</p>
<p>OBS. 3.--Though modern usage, especially in common conversation, evidently inclines to drop or shun all unnecessary suffixes and inflections, still it is true, that the English verb in some of its parts, varies its termination, to distinguish, or agree with, the different persons and numbers. The change is, however, principally confined to the second and third persons singular of the present tense of the indicative mood, and to the auxiliaries <i>hast</i> and <i>has</i> of the perfect. In the ancient biblical style, now used only on solemn occasions, the second person singular is distinguished through all the tenses of the indicative and potential moods. And as the use of the pronoun <i>thou</i> is now mostly confined to the solemn style, the terminations of that style are retained in connexion with it, through all the following examples of the conjugation of verbs. In the plural number, there is no variation of ending, to denote the different persons; and the verb in the three persons plural, (with the two exceptions <i>are</i> and <i>were</i>, from <i>am</i> and <i>was</i>,) is the same as in the first person singular. Nor does the use of <i>you</i> for the singular, warrant its connexion with any other than the plural form of the verb. This strange and needless confusion of the numbers, is, in all languages that indulge it, a practical inconvenience. It would doubtless have been much better, had <i>thou</i> and <i>you</i> still kept their respective places--the one, nominative singular--the other, objective plural--as they appear in the Bible. But as the English verb is always attended by a noun or a pronoun, expressing the subject of the affirmation, no ambiguity arises from the want of particular terminations in the verb, to distinguish the different persons and numbers.</p>
<p>OBS. 4.--Although our language, in its ordinary use, exhibits the verbs in such forms only, as will make, when put together, but a very simple conjugation; there is probably no other language on earth, in which it would be so difficult for a learned grammarian to fix, settle, and exhibit, to the satisfaction of himself and others, the principles, paradigms, rules, and exceptions, which are necessary for a full and just exhibition of this part of speech. This difficulty is owing, partly to incompatibilities or unsettled boundaries between the solemn and the familiar style; partly to differences in the same style between ancient usage and modern; partly to interfering claims of new and old forms of the preterit and the perfect participle; partly to the conflicting notions of different grammarians respecting the subjunctive mood; and partly to the blind tenacity with which many writers adhere to rugged derivatives, and prefer unutterable contractions to smooth and easy abbreviations. For example: a clergyman says to a lucky gamester, (1.) "<i>You dwell</i> in a house which <i>you</i> neither <i>planned</i> nor <i>built</i>." A member of the Society of Friends would say, (2.) "<i>Thou dwellst</i> in a house which <i>thou</i> neither <i>planned</i> nor <i>built</i>." Or, if not a scholar, as likely as not, (3.) "<i>Thee</i> dwells <i>in a house which</i> thee <i>neither</i> planned <i>nor</i> built<i>." The old or</i> solemn style would b3, (4.) "<i>Thou dwellest</i> in a house which <i>thou</i> neither <i>plannedst</i> nor <i>buildedst</i>." Some untasteful and overgrammatical poet will have it, (5.) "<i>Thou dwell'st</i> in halls <i>thou</i> neither <i>plann'dst</i> nor <i>build'dst</i>." The doctrine of Murray's Grammar, and of most others, would require, (6.) "<i>Thou dwellest</i> in a house which <i>thou</i> neither <i>plannedst</i> nor <i>builtest</i>." Or, (according to this author's method of avoiding unpleasant sounds,) the more complex form, (7.) "<i>Thou dost</i> dwell <i>in a house which</i> thou <i>neither</i> didst plan <i>nor</i> didst build<i>." Out</i> of these an other poet will make the line, (8.) "<i>Dost dwell</i> in halls which <i>thou</i> nor <i>plann'dst</i> nor <i>built'st</i>." An other, more tastefully, would drop the <i>st</i> of the preterit, and contract the present, as in the second instance above: thus,</p>
<pre>   (9.) "<i>Thou dwellst</i> in halls <i>thou</i> neither <i>planned</i> nor <i>built</i>,
        And <i>revelst</i> there in riches won by guilt."
</pre>
<p>OBS. 5.--Now let all these nine different forms of saying the same thing, by the same verbs, in the same mood, and the same two tenses, be considered. Let it also be noticed, that for these same verbs within these limits, there are yet other forms, of a complex kind; as, "<i>You do dwell</i>," or, "<i>You are dwelling</i>;" used in lieu of, "<i>Thou dost dwell</i>," or, "<i>Thou</i> art dwelling<i>:" so, "</i>You did plan<i>," or, "</i>You were planning<i>;" used in</i> lieu of, "<i>Thou didst plan</i>," or, "<i>Thou wast planning</i>." Take into the account the opinion of Dr. Webster and others, that, "<i>You was planning</i>," or, "<i>You was building</i>," is a still better form for the singular number; and well "established by national usage, both here and in England."--<i>Improved Gram.</i>, p. 25. Add the less inaccurate practice of some, who use <i>was</i> and <i>did</i> familiarly with <i>thou</i>; as, "<i>Thou was</i> planning, did thou build?<i>" Multiply all this variety tenfold, with a view</i> to the other moods and tenses of these three verbs, <i>dwell, plan</i>, and <i>build</i>; then extend the product, whatever it is, from these three common words, to <i>all</i> the verbs in the English language. You will thus begin to have some idea of the difficulty mentioned in the preceding observation. But this is only a part of it; for all these things relate only to the second person singular of the verb. The double question is, Which of these forms ought to be approved and taught for that person and number? and which of them ought to be censured and rejected as bad English? This question is perhaps as important, as any that can arise in English grammar. With a few candid observations by way of illustration, it will be left to the judgement of the reader.</p>
<p>OBS. 6.--The history of <i>youyouing</i> and <i>thoutheeing</i> appears to be this. Persons in high stations, being usually surrounded by attendants, it became, many centuries ago, a species of court flattery, to address individuals of this class, in the plural number, as if a great man were something more than one person. In this way, the notion of greatness was agreeably <i>multiplied</i>, and those who laid claim to such honour, soon began to think themselves insulted whenever they were addressed with any other than the plural pronoun.[236] Humbler people yielded through fear of offence; and the practice extended, in time, to all ranks of society: so that at present the customary mode of familiar as well as complimentary address, is altogether plural; both the verb and the pronoun being used in that form.[237] This practice, which confounds one of the most important distinctions of the language, affords a striking instance of the power of fashion. It has made propriety itself <i>seem</i> improper. But shall it be allowed, in the present state of things, to confound our conjugations and overturn our grammar? Is it right to introduce it into our paradigms, as the only form of the second person singular, that modern usage acknowledges? Or is it expedient to augment by it that multiplicity of other forms, which must either take this same place or be utterly rejected? With due deference to those grammarians who have adopted one or the other of these methods, the author of this work answers all these questions decidedly in the negative. It is not to be denied, that the use of the plural <i>for the singular</i> is now so common as to form the <i>customary mode</i> of address to individuals of every rank. The Society of Friends, or Quakers, however, continue to employ the singular number in familiar discourse; and custom, which has now destroyed the compliment of the plural, has removed also the supposed opprobrium of the singular, and placed it on an equality with the plural in point of respect. The singular is universally employed in reference to the Supreme Being; and is generally preferred in poetry. It is the language of Scripture, and of the Prayer-Book; and is consistently retained in nearly all our grammars; though not always, perhaps, consistently treated.</p>
<p>OBS. 7.--Whatever is fashionable in speech, the mere disciples of fashion will always approve; and, probably, they will think it justifiable to despise or neglect all that is otherwise. These may be contented with the sole use of such forms of address as, "<i>You, you, sir</i>;"--"<i>You, you,</i> madam<i>." But the literati who so neglect all the services of religion, as</i> to forget that these are yet conducted in English independently of all this fashionable youyouing, must needs be poor judges of what belongs to their own justification, either as grammarians or as moral agents. A fashion by virtue of which millions of youths are now growing up in ignorance of that form of address which, in their own tongue, is most appropriate to poetry, and alone adapted to prayer, is perhaps not quite so light a matter as some people imagine. It is at least so far from being a good reason for displacing that form from the paradigms of our verbs in a grammar, that indeed no better needs be offered for tenaciously retaining it. Many children may thus learn at school what all should know, and what there is little chance for them to learn elsewhere. Not all that presume to minister in religion, are well acquainted with what is called the solemn style. Not all that presume to explain it in grammars, do know what it is. A late work, which boasted the patronage of De Witt Clinton, and through the influence of false praise came nigh to be imposed by a law of New York on all the common schools of that State; and which, being subsequently sold in Philadelphia for a great price, was there republished under the name of the "National School Manual;" gives the following account of this part of grammar: "In the solemn and poetic styles, the second person singular, in both the above tenses, is thou; and the second person plural, is ye, <i>or</i> you<i>. The verb, to agree with the second person singular, changes its</i> termination. Thus: 2d person, sing. Pres. Tense, Thou walkest, <i>or Thou</i> walketh<i>. Imperfect Tense, Thou walkedst. In the third person singular,</i> in the above styles<i>, the verb has sometimes</i> a different <i>termination; as,</i> Present Tense, He, she, or <i>it walks</i> or walketh. The <i>above form of</i> inflection <i>may be applied</i> to all verbs <i>used in the solemn</i> or <i>poetic</i> <i>styles</i>; but for ordinary purposes, I have supposed it proper to employ the form of the verb, adopted in common conversation, as least perplexing to young minds."--<i>Bartlett's Common School Manual</i>, Part ii, p. 114. What can be hoped from an author who is ignorant enough to think "<i>Thou</i> walketh<i>" is good English? or from one who tells us, that "</i>It walks<i>" is</i> of the solemn style? or from one who does not know that <i>you</i> is never a <i>nominative</i> in the style of the Bible?</p>
<p>OBS. 8.--Nowhere on earth is fashion more completely mistress of all the tastes and usages of society, than in France. Though the common French Bible still retains the form of the second person singular, which in that language is shorter and perhaps smoother than the plural; yet even that sacred book, or at least the New Testament, and that by different persons, has been translated into more fashionable French, and printed at Paris, and also at New York, with the form of address everywhere plural; as, "Jesus anticipated him, saying, 'What <i>do you think</i>, Simon? of whom do the kings of the earth take taxes and tribute?'"--<i>Matt.</i>, xvii, 24. "And, going to prayers, they said, '0 Lord, <i>you who know</i> the hearts of all men, show which of these two <i>you have chosen</i>.'"--<i>Acts</i>, i, 24. This is one step further in the progress of politeness, than has yet been taken in English. The French grammarians, however, as far as I can perceive, have never yet disturbed the ancient order of their conjugations and declensions, by inserting the plural verb and pronoun in place of the singular; and, in the familiarity of friendship, or of domestic life, the practice which is denominated <i>tutoyant</i>, or <i>thoutheeing</i>, is far more prevalent in France than in England. Also, in the prayers of the French, the second person singular appears to be yet generally preserved, as it is in those of the English and the Americans. The less frequent use of it in the familiar conversation of the latter, is very probably owing to the general impression, that it cannot be used with propriety, except in the solemn style. Of this matter, those who have laid it aside themselves, cannot with much modesty pretend to judge for those who have not; or, if they may, there is still a question how far it is right to lay it aside. The following lines are a sort of translation from Horace; and I submit it to the reader, whether it is comely for a Christian divine to be less reverent toward God, than a heathen poet; and whether the plural language here used, does not lack the reverence of the original, which is singular:--</p>
<pre>  "Preserve, Almighty Providence!
   Just what <i>you gave</i> me, competence."--<i>Swift</i>.
</pre>
<p>OBS. 9.--The terms, <i>solemn style, familiar style, modern style, ancient</i> style, legal style, regal style, nautic style, common style<i>, and the like,</i> as used in grammar, imply no certain divisions of the language; but are designed merely to distinguish, in a general way, the <i>occasions</i> on which some particular forms of expression may be considered proper, or the <i>times</i> to which they belong. For what is grammatical sometimes, may not be so always. It would not be easy to tell, definitely, in what any one of these styles consists; because they all belong to one language, and the number or nature of the peculiarities of each is not precisely fixed. But whatever is acknowledged to be peculiar to any one, is consequently understood to be improper for any other: or, at least, the same phraseology cannot belong to styles of an opposite character; and words of general use belong to no particular style.[238] For example: "So then it is not of him that <i>willeth</i>, nor of him that <i>runneth</i>, but of God that <i>showeth</i> mercy."--<i>Rom.</i>, ix, 16. If the termination <i>eth</i> is not obsolete, as some say it is, all verbs to which this ending is added, are of the solemn style; for the common or familiar expression would here be this; "So then it is not of him that <i>wills</i>, nor of him that <i>runs</i>, but of God that <i>shows</i> mercy." Ben Jonson, in his grammar, endeavoured to arrest this change of <i>eth</i> to <i>s</i>; and, according to Lindley Murray, (<i>Octavo Gram.</i>, p. 90,) Addison also injudiciously disapproved it. In spite of all such objections, however, some future grammarian will probably have to say of the singular ending <i>eth</i>, as Lowth and Murray have already said of the plural <i>en</i>: "It was laid aside as unnecessary."</p>
<p>OBS. 10.--Of the origin of the personal terminations of English verbs, that eminent etymologist Dr. Alexander Murray, gives the following account: "The readers of our modern tongue may be reminded, that the terminations, <i>est,</i> eth<i>, and</i> s<i>, in our verbs, as in</i> layest, layeth<i>, and</i> laid'st<i>, or</i> <i>laidest</i>; are the faded <i>remains of the pronouns</i> which were formerly joined to the verb itself, and placed the language, in respect of concise expression, on a level with the Greek, Latin, and Sanscrit, its sister dialects."--<i>History of European Languages</i>, Vol. i, p. 52. According to this, since other signs of the persons and numbers are now employed with the verb, it is not strange that there should appear a tendency to lay aside such of these endings as are least agreeable and least necessary. Any change of this kind will of course occur first in the familiar style. For example: "Thou <i>wentest</i> in to men uncircumcised, and <i>didst eat</i> with them."--<i>Acts</i>, xi, 3. "These things write I unto thee, that thou <i>mayst</i> know how thou <i>oughtest</i> to behave thyself in the house of God."--<i>1 Tim.</i>, iii, 15. These forms, by universal consent, are now of the solemn style; and, consequently, are really good English in no other. For nobody, I suppose, will yet pretend that the inflection of our preterits and auxiliaries by <i>st</i> or <i>est</i>, is entirely <i>obsolete</i>;[239] and surely no person of any literary taste ever uses the foregoing forms familiarly. The termination <i>est</i>, however, has <i>in some instances</i> become obsolete; or has faded into <i>st</i> or <i>t</i>, even in the solemn style. Thus, (if indeed, such forms ever were in good use,) <i>diddest</i> has become <i>didst; havest, hast;</i> haddest, hadst; shallest, shalt; willest, wilt<i>; and</i> cannest, canst. Mayest, mightest, couldest, wouldest<i>, and</i> shouldest<i>, are occasionally</i> found in books not ancient; but <i>mayst, mightst, couldst, wouldst</i>, and <i>shouldst</i>, are abundantly more common, and all are peculiar to the solemn style. <i>Must, burst, durst, thrust, blest, curst, past, lost, list, crept,</i> kept, girt, built, felt, dwelt, left, bereft<i>, and many other verbs of</i> similar endings, are seldom, if ever, found encumbered with an additional <i>est</i>. For the rule which requires this ending, has always had many exceptions that have not been noticed by grammarians.[240] Thus Shakspeare wrote even in the present tense, "Do as thou <i>list</i>," and not "Do as thou <i>listest</i>." Possibly, however, <i>list</i> may here be reckoned of the subjunctive mood; but the following example from Byron is certainly in the indicative:--</p>
<pre>  "And thou, who never yet of human wrong
   <i>Lost</i> the unbalanced scale, great Nemesis!"--<i>Harold</i>, C. iv, st. 132.
</pre>
<p>OBS. 11.--Any phraseology that is really obsolete, is no longer fit to be imitated even in the solemn style; and what was never good English, is no more to be respected in that style, than in any other. Thus: "Art not thou that Egyptian, <i>which</i> before these days <i>madest</i> an uproar, and <i>leddest</i> out into the wilderness four thousand men that were murderers?"--<i>Acts</i>, xxi, 38. Here, (I think,) the version ought to be, "Art not thou that Egyptian, <i>who</i> a while ago <i>made</i> an uproar, and <i>led</i> out into the wilderness four thousand men, that were murderers?" If so, there is in this no occasion to make a difference between the solemn and the familiar style. But what is the familiar form of expression for the texts cited before? The fashionable will say, it is this: "<i>You went</i> in to men uncircumcised, and <i>did eat</i> with them."--"I write these things to <i>you</i>, that <i>you may know</i> how <i>you ought</i> to behave <i>yourself</i> in the house of God." But this is not <i>literally</i> of the singular number: it is no more singular, than <i>vos</i> in Latin, or <i>vous</i> in French, or <i>we</i> used for <i>I</i> in English, is singular. And if there remains to us any other form, that is both singular and grammatical, it is unquestionably the following: "<i>Thou went</i> in to men uncircumcised, and <i>did eat</i> with them."--"I write these things to <i>thee</i>, that thou <i>may know</i> how <i>thou ought</i> to behave <i>thyself</i> in the house of God." The acknowledged doctrine of all the teachers of English grammar, that the inflection of our auxiliaries and preterits by <i>st</i> or <i>est</i> is peculiar to "the solemn style," leaves us no other alternative, than either to grant the propriety of here dropping the suffix for the familiar style, or to rob our language of any familiar use of the pronoun <i>thou</i> forever. Who, then, are here the neologists, the innovators, the impairers of the language? And which is the greater <i>innovation</i>, merely to drop, on familiar occasions, or <i>when it suits our style</i>, one obsolescent verbal termination,--a termination often dropped <i>of old</i> as well as now,--or to strike from the conjugations of all our verbs one sixth part of their entire scheme?[241]</p>
<pre>  "O mother myn, that cleaped <i>were</i> Argyue,
   Wo worth that day that thou me <i>bare</i> on lyue."--<i>Chaucer</i>.
</pre>
<p>OBS. 12.--The grammatical propriety of distinguishing from the solemn style both of the forms presented above, must be evident to every one who considers with candour the reasons, analogies, and authorities, for this distinction. The support of the latter is very far from resting solely on the practice of a particular sect; though this, if they would forbear to corrupt the pronoun while they simplify the verb, would deserve much more consideration than has ever been allowed it. Which of these modes of address is the more grammatical, it is useless to dispute; since fashion rules the one, and a scruple of conscience is sometimes alleged for the other. A candid critic will consequently allow all to take their choice. It is enough for him, if he can demonstrate to the candid inquirer, what phraseology is in any view allowable, and what is for any good reason reprehensible. That the use of the plural for the singular is ungrammatical, it is neither discreet nor available to affirm; yet, surely, it did not originate in any regard to grammar rules. Murray the schoolmaster, whose English Grammar appeared some years before that of Lindley Murray, speaks of it as follows: "<i>Thou</i>, the second person singular, though <i>strictly grammatical</i>, is seldom used, except in addresses to God, in poetry, and by the people called Quakers. In all other cases, a <i>fondness for foreign manners</i>,[242] and the power of custom, have given a sanction to the use of <i>you</i>, for the second person singular, though <i>contrary to grammar</i>,[243] and attended with this particular inconveniency, that a plural verb must be used to agree with the pronoun in number, and both applied to a <i>single person</i>; as, <i>you are</i>, or <i>you</i> were<i>,--not</i> you wast<i>, or</i> you was<i>."--</i>Third Edition<i>, Lond., 1793, p.</i> 34. This author everywhere exhibits the auxiliaries, <i>mayst, mightst,</i> couldst, wouldst<i>, and</i> shouldst<i>, as words of one syllable; and also</i> observes, in a marginal note, "Some writers begin to say, <b>Thou may, thou</b> might<i>,' &amp;c."--</i>Ib.<i>, p. 36. Examples of this are not very uncommon: "Thou</i> <i>shall</i> want ere I want."--<i>Old Motto; Scott's Lay</i>, Note 1st to Canto 3. "Thyself the mournful tale <i>shall</i> tell."--<i>Felton's Gram.</i>, p. 20.</p>
<pre>  "One sole condition would I dare suggest,
   That <i>thou would save</i> me from my own request."--<i>Jane Taylor</i>.
</pre>
<p>OBS. 13.--In respect to the second person singular, the grammar of Lindley Murray makes no distinction between the solemn and the familiar style; recognizes in no way the fashionable substitution of <i>you</i> for <i>thou</i>; and, so far as I perceive, takes it for granted, that every one who pretends to speak or write grammatically, must always, in addressing an individual, employ the singular pronoun, and inflect the verb with <i>st</i> or <i>est</i>, except in the imperative mood and the subjunctive present. This is the more remarkable, because the author was a valued member of the Society of Friends; and doubtless his own daily practice contradicted his doctrine, as palpably as does that of every other member of the Society. And many a schoolmaster, taking that work for his text-book, or some other as faulty, is now doing precisely the same thing. But what a teacher is he, who dares not justify as a grammarian that which he constantly practices as a man! What a scholar is he, who can be led by a false criticism or a false custom, to condemn his own usage and that of every body else! What a casuist is he, who dares pretend conscience for practising that which he knows and acknowledges to be wrong! If to speak in the second person singular without inflecting our preterits and auxiliaries, is a censurable corruption of the language, the Friends have no alternative but to relinquish their scruple about the application of <i>you</i> to one person; for none but the adult and learned can ever speak after the manner of ancient books: children and common people can no more be brought to speak agreeably to any antiquated forms of the English language, than according to the imperishable models of Greek and Latin. He who traces the history of our vernacular tongue, will find it has either simplified or entirely dropped several of its ancient terminations; and that the <i>st</i> or <i>est</i> of the second person singular, <i>never was adopted</i> in any thing like the extent to which our modern grammarians have attempted to impose it. "Thus becoming unused to inflections, we lost the perception of their meaning and nature."--<i>Philological Museum</i>, i, 669. "You cannot make a whole people all at once talk in a different tongue from that which it has been used to talk in: you cannot force it to unlearn the words it has learnt from its fathers, in order to learn a set of newfangled words out of [a grammar or] a dictionary."--<i>Ib.</i>, i, 650. Nor can you, in this instance, restrain our poets from transgressing the doctrine of Lowth and Murray:--</p>
<pre>  "Come, thou pure Light,--which first in Eden <i>glowed.</i>
   And <i>threw</i> thy splendor round man's calm abode."--<i>Alonzo Lewis</i>.
</pre>
<p>OBS. 14.--That which has passed away from familiar practice, may still be right in the solemn style, and may there remain till it becomes obsolete. But no obsolescent termination has ever yet been recalled into the popular service. This is as true in other languages as in our own: "In almost every word of the Greek," says a learned author, "we meet with contractions and abbreviations; but, I believe, the flexions of no language allow of extension or amplification. In our own we may write <i>sleeped</i> or <i>slept</i>, as the metre of a line or the rhythm of a period may require; but by no license may we write <i>sleepeed.</i>"--<i>Knight, on the Greek Alphabet</i>, 4to, p. 107. But, if after contracting <i>sleeped</i> into <i>slept</i>, we add an <i>est</i> and make <i>sleptest</i>, is there not here an extension of the word from one syllable to two? Is there not an amplification that is at once novel, disagreeable, unauthorized, and unnecessary? Nay, even in the regular and established change, as of <i>loved</i> to <i>lovedst</i>, is there not a syllabic increase, which is unpleasant to the ear, and unsuited to familiar speech? Now, to what extent do these questions apply to the verbs in our language? Lindley Murray, it is presumed, had no conception of that extent; or of the weight of the objection which is implied in the second. With respect to a vast number of our most common verbs, he himself never knew, nor does the greatest grammarian now living know, in what way he ought to form the simple past tense in the second person singular, otherwise than by the mere uninflected preterit with the pronoun <i>thou</i>. Is <i>thou sleepedst</i> or <i>thou</i> sleptest, thou leavedst <i>or</i> thou leftest, thou feeledst <i>or</i> thou feltest, thou dealedst <i>or</i> thou dealtest, thou tossedst <i>or</i> thou tostest, thou losedst <i>or</i> thou lostest, thou payedst <i>or</i> thou paidest, thou layedst <i>or</i> <i>thou laidest</i>, better English than <i>thou slept, thou left, thou felt, thou</i> dealt, thou tossed, thou lost, thou paid, thou laid? <i>And, if so, of the</i> two forms in each instance, which is the right one? and why? The Bible has "<i>saidst</i>" and "<i>layedst</i>;" Dr. Alexander Murray, "<i>laid'st</i>" and "<i>laidest!</i>" Since the inflection of our preterits has never been orderly, and is now decaying and waxing old, shall we labour to recall what is so nearly ready to vanish away?</p>
<pre>  "Tremendous Sea! what time <i>thou lifted</i> up
   Thy waves on high, and with thy winds and storms
   Strange pastime <i>took</i>, and <i>shook</i> thy mighty sides
   Indignantly, the pride of navies fell."--<i>Pollok</i>, B. vii, l. 611.
</pre>
<p>OBS. 15.--Whatever difficulty there is in ascertaining the true form of the preterit itself, not only remains, but is augmented, when <i>st</i> or <i>est</i> is to be added for the second person of it. For, since we use sometimes one and sometimes the other of these endings; (as, said<i>st</i>, saw<i>est</i>, bid<i>st</i>, knew<i>est</i>, loved<i>st</i>, went<i>est</i>;) there is yet need of some rule to show which we ought to prefer. The variable formation or orthography of verbs in the simple past tense, has always been one of the greatest difficulties that the learners of our language have had to encounter. At present, there is a strong tendency to terminate as many as we can of them in <i>ed</i>, which is the only regular ending. The pronunciation of this ending, however, is at least threefold; as in <i>remembered, repented, relinquished.</i> Here the added sounds are, first <i>d</i>, then <i>ed</i>, then <i>t</i>; and the effect of adding <i>st</i>, whenever the <i>ed</i> is sounded like <i>t</i>, will certainly be a perversion of what is established as the true pronunciation of the language. For the solemn and the familiar pronunciation of <i>ed</i> unquestionably differ. The present tendency to a regular orthography, ought rather to be encouraged than thwarted; but the preferring of <i>mixed</i> to <i>mixt, whipped</i> to <i>whipt,</i> worked <i>to</i> wrought, kneeled <i>to</i> knelt<i>, and so forth, does not make</i> <i>mixedst, whippedst, workedst, kneeledst</i>, and the like, any more fit for modern English, than are <i>mixtest, whiptest, wroughtest, kneltest,</i> burntest, dweltest, heldest, giltest<i>, and many more of the like stamp. And</i> what can be more absurd than for a grammarian to insist upon forming a great parcel of these strange and crabbed words for which he can quote no good authority? Nothing; except it be for a poet or a rhetorician to huddle together great parcels of consonants which no mortal man can utter,[244] (as <i>lov'dst, lurk'dst, shrugg'dst</i>,) and call them "<i>words</i>." Example: "The clump of <i>subtonick</i> and <i>atonick</i> elements at the termination of <i>such words</i> as the following, is frequently, to the no small injury of articulation, particularly slighted: couldst, wouldst, hadst, prob'st, <i>prob'dst</i>, hurl'st, <i>hurl'dst</i>, arm'st, <i>arm'dst</i>, want'st, <i>want'dst</i>, burn'st, <i>burn'dst</i>, bark'st, <i>bark'dst</i>, bubbl'st, <i>bubbl'dst, troubbl'st,</i> troubbl'dst.<i>"--</i>Kirkham's Elocution<i>, p. 42.

</pre>
<p>OBS. 16.--Dr. Lowth, whose popular little Grammar was written in or about 1758, made no scruple to hem up both the poets and the Friends at once, by a criticism which I must needs consider more dogmatical than true; and which, from the suppression of what is least objectionable in it, has become, her hands, the source of still greater errors: "<i>Thou</i> in the polite, and even <i>in the familiar style, is disused</i>, and the plural <i>you</i> is employed instead of it; we say, <i>you have</i>, not <i>thou hast.</i> Though in this case, we apply <i>you</i> to a single person, yet the verb too <i>must agree</i> with it in the plural number<i>; it must necessarily be,</i> you have<i>, not</i> you hast. You was <i>is an enormous solecism,[245] and yet authors of the first</i> rank have inadvertently fallen into it. * * * On the contrary, the solemn style admits not of you for a single person. This <i>hath led</i> Mr. Pope into <i>a great impropriety</i> in the beginning of his Messiah:--</p>
<pre>  'O thou my voice inspire,
   Who <i>touch'd</i> Isaiah's hallow'd lips with fire!'
</pre>
<p>The solemnity of the style would not admit of <i>you</i> for <i>thou</i>, in the pronoun; nor the measure of the verse <i>touchedst</i>, or <i>didst touch</i>, in the verb, as it <i>indispensably ought to be</i>, in the one or the other of those two forms; <i>you</i>, who <i>touched</i>, or <i>thou</i>, who <i>touchedst</i>, or <i>didst</i> touch.</p>
<pre>  'Just of <i>thy</i> word, in every thought sincere;
   Who <i>knew</i> no wish, but what the world might hear.'--Pope.
</pre>
<p>It ought to be <i>your</i> in the first line, or <i>knewest</i> in the second. In order to avoid this <i>grammatical inconvenience</i>, the two distinct forms of <i>thou</i> and <i>you</i>, are often used promiscuously by our modern poets, in the same paragraph, and even in the same sentence, very inelegantly and improperly:--</p>
<pre>  'Now, now, I seize, I clasp <i>thy</i> charms;
   And now <i>you burst</i>, ah cruel! from my arms.'--Pope."
       --<i>Lowth's English Gram.</i>, p. 34.
</pre>
<p>OBS. 17.--The points of Dr. Lowth's doctrine which are not sufficiently true, are the following: First, it is not true, that <i>thou</i>, in the familiar style, is <i>totally disused</i>, and the plural <i>you</i> employed universally in its stead; though Churchill, and others, besides the good bishop, seem to represent it so. It is now nearly two hundred years since the rise of the Society of Friends: and, whatever may have been the practice of others before or since, it is certain, that from their rise to the present day, there have been, at every point of time, many thousands who made no use of <i>you</i> for <i>thou</i>; and, but for the clumsy forms which most grammarians hold to be indispensable to verbs of the second person singular, the beautiful, distinctive, and poetical words, <i>thou, thyself,</i> thy, thine<i>, and</i> thee<i>, would certainly be in no danger yet of becoming</i> obsolete. Nor can they, indeed, at any rate, become so, till the fairest branches of the Christian Church shall wither; or, what should seem no gracious omen, her bishops and clergy learn to <i>pray in the plural number</i>, for fashion's sake. Secondly, it is not true, that, "<i>thou</i>, who <i>touch'd</i>," ought <i>indispensably</i> to be, "<i>thou</i>, who <i>touchedst</i>, or <i>didst touch</i>." It is far better to dispense with the inflection, in such a case, than either to impose it, or to resort to the plural pronoun. The "grammatical inconvenience" of dropping the <i>st</i> or <i>est</i> of a preterit, even in the solemn style, cannot be great, and may be altogether imaginary; that of imposing it, except in solemn prose, is not only real, but is often insuperable. It is not very agreeable, however, to see it added to some verbs, and dropped from others, in the same sentence: as,</p>
<pre>  "Thou, who <i>didst call</i> the Furies from the abyss,
   And round Orestes <i>bade</i> them howl and hiss."
       --<i>Byron's Childe Harold</i>, Canto iv, st. 132.
</pre>
<pre>  "Thou <i>satt'st</i> from age to age insatiate,
   And <i>drank</i> the blood of men, and <i>gorged</i> their flesh."
       --<i>Pollok's Course of Time</i>, B. vii, l. 700.
</pre>
<p>OBS. 18.--We see then, that, according to Dr. Lowth and others, <i>the only</i> good English <i>in which one can address an individual on any ordinary</i> occasion, is <i>you</i> with a plural verb; and that, according to Lindley Murray and others, <i>the only good English</i> for the same purpose, is <i>thou</i> with a verb inflected with <i>st</i> or <i>est</i>. Both parties to this pointed contradiction, are more or less in the wrong. The respect of the Friends for those systems of grammar which deny them the familiar use of the pronoun <i>thou</i>, is certainly not more remarkable, than the respect of the world for those which condemn the substitution of the plural <i>you</i>. Let grammar be a true record of existing facts, and all such contradictions must vanish. And, certainly, these great masters here contradict each other, in what every one who reads English, ought to know. They agree, however, in requiring, as indispensable to grammar, what is not only inconvenient, but absolutely impossible. For what "the measure of verse <i>will not admit</i>," cannot be used in poetry; and what may possibly be crowded into it, will often be far from ornamental. Yet our youth have been taught to spoil the versification of Pope and others, after the following manner: "Who <i>touch'd</i> Isaiah's hallow'd lips with fire." Say, "Who <i>touchedst</i> or <i>didst touch</i>."--<i>Murray's Key</i>, 8vo, p. 180. "For thee that ever <i>felt</i> another's wo." Say, "<i>Didst feel</i>."--<i>Ib.</i> "Who <i>knew</i> no wish but what the world might hear." Say, "Who <i>knewest</i> or <i>didst</i> know<i>."--</i>Ib. <i>"Who all my sense</i> confin'd<i>." Say, "</i>Confinedst <i>or</i> didst confine<i>."--</i>Ib.<i>, p. 186. "Yet</i> gave <i>me in this dark estate." Say,</i> "<i>Gavedst</i> or <i>didst give</i>."--<i>Ib.</i> "<i>Left</i> free the human will."--<i>Pope</i>. Murray's criticism extends not to this line, but by the analogy we must say, "<i>Leavedst</i> or <i>leftest</i>." Now it would be easier to fill a volume with such quotations, and such corrections, than to find sufficient authority to prove one such word as <i>gavedst, leavedst</i>, or <i>leftest</i>, to be really good English. If Lord Byron is authority for "<i>work'dst</i>," he is authority also for dropping the <i>st</i>, even where it might be added:--</p>
<pre>   ----"Thou, who with thy frown
   <i>Annihilated</i> senates."
       --<i>Childe Harold's Pilgrimage</i>, Canto iv, st. 83.
</pre>
<p>OBS. 19.--According to Dr. Lowth, as well as Coar and some others, those preterits in which <i>ed</i> is sounded like <i>t</i>, "admit the change of <i>ed</i> into <i>t</i>; as, <i>snacht, checkt, snapt, mixt</i>, dropping also one of the double letters, <i>dwelt, past</i>."--<i>Lowth's Gram.</i>, p. 46. If this principle were generally adopted, the number of our regular verbs would be greatly diminished, and irregularities would be indefinitely increased. What confusion the practice must make in the language, especially when we come to inflect this part of the verb with <i>st</i> or <i>est</i>, has already been suggested. Yet an ingenious and learned writer, an able contributor to the Philological Museum, published at Cambridge, England, in 1832; tracing the history of this class of derivatives, and finding that after the <i>ed</i> was contracted in pronunciation, several eminent writers, as Spenser, Milton, and others, adopted in most instances a contracted form of orthography; has seriously endeavoured to bring us back to their practice. From these authors, he cites an abundance of such contractions as the following: 1. "Stowd, hewd, subdewd, joyd, cald, expeld, compeld, spoild, kild, seemd, benumbd, armd, redeemd, staind, shund, paynd, stird, appeard, perceivd, resolvd, obeyd, equald, foyld, hurld, ruind, joynd, scatterd, witherd," and others ending in <i>d</i>. 2. "Clapt, whipt, worshipt, lopt, stopt, stampt, pickt, knockt, linkt, puft, stuft, hist, kist, abasht, brusht, astonisht, vanquisht, confest, talkt, twicht," and many others ending in <i>t</i>. This scheme divides our regular verbs into three classes; leaving but very few of them to be written as they now are. It proceeds upon the principle of accommodating our orthography to the familiar, rather than to the solemn pronunciation of the language. "This," as Dr. Johnson observes, "is to measure by a shadow." It is, whatever show of learning or authority may support it, a pernicious innovation. The critic says, "I have not ventured to follow the example of Spenser and Milton throughout, but have merely attempted to revive the old form of the preterit in <i>t</i>."--<i>Phil. Museum</i>, Vol. i, p. 663. "We ought not however to stop here," he thinks; and suggests that it would be no small improvement, "to write <i>leveld</i> for <i>levelled, enameld</i> for <i>enamelled, reformd</i> for <i>reformed</i>," &amp;c.</p>
<p>OBS. 20.--If the multiplication of irregular preterits, as above described, is a grammatical error of great magnitude; the forcing of our old and well-known irregular verbs into regular forms that are seldom if ever used, is an opposite error nearly as great. And, in either case, there is the same embarrassment respecting the formation of the second person. Thus <i>Cobbett</i>, in his English Grammar in a Series of Letters, has dogmatically given us a list of <i>seventy</i> verbs, which, he says, are, "by some persons, <i>erroneously deemed irregular</i>;" and has included in it the words, <i>blow,</i> build, cast, cling, creep, freeze, draw, throw<i>, and the like, to the</i> number of <i>sixty</i>; so that he is really right in no more than one seventh part of his catalogue. And, what is more strange, for several of the irregularities which he censures, his own authority may be quoted from the early editions of this very book: as, "For you could have <i>thrown</i> about seeds."--Edition of 1818, p. 13. "For you could have <i>throwed</i> about seeds."--Edition of 1832, p. 13. "A tree is <i>blown</i> down."--Ed. of 1818, p. 27. "A tree is <i>blowed</i> down."--Ed. of 1832, p. 25. "It <i>froze</i> hard last night. Now, what was it that <i>froze</i> so hard?"--Ed. of 1818, p. 38. "It <i>freezed</i> hard last night. Now, what was it that <i>freezed</i> so hard?"--Ed. of 1832, p. 35. A whole page of such contradictions may be quoted from this one grammarian, showing that <i>he did not know</i> what form of the preterit he ought to prefer. From such an instructor, who can find out what is good English, and what is not? Respecting the inflections of the verb, this author says, "There are three persons; <i>but, our verbs have no variation in</i> their spelling, except for the third person singular<i>."--</i>Cobbett's E. Gram.<i>, ¶ 88. Again: "Observe, however, that, in our language, there is no</i> very great use in this distinction of modes; because, for the most part, our little <i>signs</i> do the business, and <i>they never vary in the letters of</i> which they are composed<i>."--</i>Ib.<i>, ¶ 95. One would suppose, from these</i> remarks, that Cobbett meant to dismiss the pronoun <i>thou</i> entirely from his conjugations. Not so at all. In direct contradiction to himself, he proceeds to inflect the verb as follows: "I work, <i>Thou workest</i>, He works; &amp;c. I worked, <i>Thou workedst</i>, He worked; &amp;c. I shall or will work, <i>Thou</i> shalt or wilt work<i>, He shall or will work;" &amp;c.--</i>Ib.<i>, ¶ 98. All the</i> <i>compound</i> tenses, except the future, he rejects, as things which "can only serve to fill up a book."</p>
<p>OBS. 21.--It is a common but erroneous opinion of our grammarians, that the unsyllabic suffix <i>st</i>, wherever found, is a modern contraction of the syllable <i>est</i>. No writer, however, thinks it always necessary to remind his readers of this, by inserting the sign of contraction; though English books are not a little disfigured by questionable apostrophes inserted for no other reason. Dr. Lowth says, "The nature of our language, the accent and pronunciation of it, inclines [incline] us to contract even all our regular verbs: thus <i>loved, turned</i>, are commonly pronounced in one syllable <i>lov'd, turn'd</i>: and the second person, which was originally in three syllables, <i>lovedest, turnedest</i>, is [say <i>has</i>] now become a dissyllable, <i>lovedst, turnedst</i>."--<i>Lowth's Gram.</i>, p. 45; <i>Hiley's</i>, 45; <i>Churchill's</i>, 104. See also <i>Priestley's Gram.</i>, p. 114; and <i>Coar's</i>, p. 102. This latter doctrine, with all its vouchers, still needs confirmation. What is it but an idle conjecture? If it were <i>true</i>, a few quotations might easily prove it; but when, and by whom, have any such words as <i>lovedest, turnedest</i>, ever been used? For aught I see, the simple <i>st</i> is as complete and as old a termination for the second person singular of an English verb, as <i>est</i>; indeed, it appears to be <i>older</i>: and, for the preterit, it is, and (I believe) <i>always has been</i>, the <i>most</i> regular, if not the <i>only</i> regular, addition. If <i>sufferedest, woundedest</i>, and <i>killedest</i>, are words more regular than <i>sufferedst, woundedst, killedst</i>, then are <i>heardest, knewest, slewest, sawest, rannest, metest, swammest</i>, and the like, more regular than <i>heardst, knewst, slewst, sawst, ranst,</i> metst, swamst, satst, saidst, ledst, fledst, toldst<i>, and so forth; but not</i> otherwise.[246] So, in the solemn style, we write <i>seemest, deemest,</i> swimmest<i>, like</i> seemeth, deemeth, swimmeth<i>, and so forth; but, when we</i> use the form which has no increase of syllables, why is an apostrophe more necessary in the second person, than in the third?--in <i>seemst, deemst,</i> swimst<i>, than in</i> seems, deems, swims<i>? When final</i> e <i>is dropped from the</i> verb, the case is different; as,</p>
<pre>  "Thou <i>cutst</i> my head off with a golden axe,
   And <i>smil'st</i> upon the stroke that murders me."--<i>Shakspeare</i>.
</pre>
<p>OBS. 22.--Dr. Lowth supposes the verbal termination <i>s</i> or <i>es</i> to have come from a contraction of <i>eth</i>. He says, "Sometimes, by the rapidity of our pronunciation, the vowels are shortened or lost; and the consonants, which are thrown together, do not coalesce with one another, and are therefore changed into others of the same organ, or of a kindred species. This occasions a farther deviation from <i>the regular form</i>: thus, <i>loveth,</i> turneth<i>, are contracted into</i> lov'th, turn'th<i>, and these, for easier</i> pronunciation, <i>immediately</i> become <i>loves, turns</i>."--<i>Lowth's Gram.</i>, p. 46; <i>Hiley's</i>, 45. This etymology may possibly be just, but certainly such contractions as are here spoken of, were not very common in Lowth's age, or even in that of Ben Jonson, who resisted the <i>s</i>. Nor is the sound of sharp <i>th</i> very obviously akin to flat <i>s</i>. The change would have been less violent, if <i>lov'st</i> and <i>turnst</i> had become <i>loves</i> and <i>turns</i>; as some people nowadays are apt to change them, though doubtless this is a grammatical error: as,</p>
<pre>  "And wheresoe'er thou <i>casts</i> thy view."
       --<i>Cowley</i>.
</pre>
<pre>   "Nor thou that <i>flings</i> me floundering from thy back."
       --<i>Bat. of Frogs and Mice</i>, 1,123.
</pre>
<pre>   "Thou <i>sitt'st</i> on high, and <i>measures</i> destinies."
       --<i>Pollok, Course of Time</i>, B. vi, 1, 668.
</pre>
<p>OBS. 23.--Possibly, those personal terminations of the verb which do not form syllables, are mere contractions or relics of <i>est</i> and <i>eth</i>, which are syllables; but it is perhaps not quite so easy to prove them so, as some authors imagine. In the oldest specimens given by Dr. Johnson in his History of the English Language,--specimens bearing a much earlier date than the English language can claim,--even in what he calls "Saxon in its highest state of purity," both <i>st</i> and <i>th</i> are often added to verbs, without forming additional syllables, and without any sign of contraction. Nor were verbs of the second person singular always inflected of old, in those parts to which <i>est</i> was afterwards very commonly added. Examples: "Buton ic wat thæt thu <i>hoefst</i> thara wæpna."--<i>King Alfred</i>. "But I know that thou <i>hast</i> those weapons." "Thæt thu <i>oncnawe</i> thara worda sothfæstnesse. of tham the thu <i>geloered eart</i>."--<i>Lucæ</i>, i, 4. "That thou <i>mightest know</i> the certainty of those things wherein thou <i>hast been</i> instructed<i>."--</i>Luke<i>, i, 4. "And thu</i> nemst <i>his naman Johannes."--</i>Lucæ<i>,</i> i, 13. "And his name <i>schal be clepid</i> Jon."--<i>Wickliffe's Version</i>. "And thou <i>shalt call</i> his name John."--<i>Luke</i>, i, 13. "And he ne <i>drincth</i> win ne beor."--<i>Lucæ</i>, i, 15. "He <i>schal</i> not <i>drinke</i> wyn ne sydyr."--<i>Wickliffe</i>. "And <i>shall drink</i> neither wine nor strong drink."--<i>Luke</i>, i, 15. "And nu thu <i>bist</i> suwigende. and thu <i>sprecan</i> ne <i>miht</i> oth thone dæg the thas thing <i>gewurthath</i>. fortham thu minum wordum ne <i>gelyfdest</i>. tha <i>beoth</i> on hyra timan <i>gefyllede</i>."--<i>Lucæ</i>, i, 20. "And lo, thou <i>schalt</i> be doumbe, and thou <i>schalt</i> not mowe <i>speke</i>, til into the day in which these thingis <i>schulen be don</i>, for thou <i>hast</i> not <i>beleved</i> to my wordis, whiche <i>schulen be fulfild</i> in her tyme."--<i>Wickliffe</i>. "And, behold, thou <i>shalt</i> be dumb, and not able to speak, until the day <i>that</i>[247] these things <i>shall be performed</i>, because thou <i>believest</i> not my words, which <i>shall be fulfilled</i> in their season."--<i>Luke</i>, i, 20.</p>

</pre>
<p>OBS. 24.--The corollary towards which the foregoing observations are directed, is this. As most of the peculiar terminations by which the second person singular is properly distinguished in the solemn style, are not only difficult of utterance, but are quaint and formal in conversation; the preterits and auxiliaries of our verbs are seldom varied in familiar discourse, and the present is generally simplified by contraction, or by the adding of <i>st</i> without increase of syllables. A distinction between the solemn and the familiar style has long been admitted, in the pronunciation of the termination <i>ed</i>, and in the ending of the verb in the third person singular; and it is evidently according to good taste and the best usage, to admit such a distinction in the second person singular. In the familiar use of the second person singular, the verb is usually varied only in the present tense of the indicative mood, and in the auxiliary <i>hast</i> of the perfect. This method of varying the verb renders the second person singular analogous to the third, and accords with the practice of the most intelligent of those who retain the common use of this distinctive and consistent mode of address. It disencumbers their familiar dialect of a multitude of harsh and useless terminations, which serve only, when uttered, to give an uncouth prominency to words not often emphatic; and, without impairing the strength or perspicuity of the language, increases its harmony, and reduces the form of the verb in the second person singular nearly to the same simplicity as in the other persons and numbers. It may serve also, in some instances, to justify the poets, in those abbreviations for which they have been so unreasonably censured by Lowth, Murray, and some other grammarians: as,</p>
<pre>  "And thou their natures <i>knowst</i>, and <i>gave</i> them names,
   Needless to thee repeated."--<i>Milton</i>, P. L., Book vii, line 494.
</pre>
<p>OBS. 25.--The writings of the Friends, being mostly of a grave cast, afford but few examples of their customary manner of forming the verb in connexion with the pronoun <i>thou</i>, in familiar discourse. The following may serve to illustrate it: "Suitable to the office thou <i>layst</i> claim to."--R. BARCLAY'S <i>Works</i>, Vol. i, p. 27. "Notwithstanding thou <i>may have</i> sentiments opposite to mine."--THOMAS STORY. "To devote all thou <i>had</i> to his service;"--"If thou <i>should come</i>;"--"What thou <i>said</i>;"--"Thou kindly <i>contributed</i>;"--"The epistle which thou <i>sent</i> me;"--"Thou <i>would</i> perhaps <i>allow</i>;"--"If thou <i>submitted</i>;"--"Since thou <i>left</i>;"--"<i>Should</i> thou <i>act</i>;"--"Thou <i>may be</i> ready;"--"That thou <i>had met</i>;"--"That thou <i>had</i> intimated<i>;"--"Before thou</i> puts<i>" [putst];--"What thou</i> meets<i>"</i> [meetst];--"If thou <i>had made</i>;"--"I observed thou <i>was</i>;"--"That thou <i>might put</i> thy trust;"--"Thou <i>had been</i> at my house."--JOHN KENDALL. "Thou <i>may be plundered</i>;"--"That thou <i>may feel</i>;"--"Though thou <i>waited</i> long, and <i>sought</i> him;"--"I hope thou <i>will bear</i> my style;"--"Thou also <i>knows</i>" [knowst];--"Thou <i>grew</i> up;"--"I wish thou <i>would</i> yet <i>take</i> my counsel."--STEPHEN CRISP. "Thou <i>manifested</i> thy tender regard, <i>stretched</i> forth thy delivering hand, and <i>fed</i> and <i>sustained</i> us."--SAMUEL FOTHERGILL. The writer has met with thousands that used the second person singular in conversation, but never with any one that employed, on ordinary occasions, all the regular endings of the solemn style. The simplification of the second person singular, which, to a greater or less extent, is everywhere adopted by the Friends, and which is here defined and explained, removes from each verb eighteen of these peculiar terminations; and, (if the number of English verbs be, as stated by several grammarians, 8000,) disburdens their familiar dialect of 144,000 of these awkward and useless appendages.[248] This simplification is supported by usage as extensive as the familiar use of the pronoun <i>thou</i>; and is also in accordance with the canons of criticism: "The <i>first</i> canon on this subject is, All words and phrases which are remarkably harsh and unharmonious, and not absolutely necessary, should be rejected." See <i>Campbell's Philosophy of Rhetoric</i>, B. ii, Ch. ii, Sec. 2, Canon Sixth, p. 181. See also, in the same work, (B. hi, Ch. iv, Sec. 2d,) an <i>express defence</i> of "those elisions whereby the sound is improved;" especially of the suppression of the "feeble vowel in the last syllable of the preterits of our regular verbs;" and of "such abbreviations" as "the eagerness of conveying one's sentiments, the rapidity and ease of utterance, necessarily produce, in the dialect of conversation."--Pages 426 and 427. Lord Kames says, "That the English tongue, originally harsh, is at present much softened by dropping many <i>redundant consonants</i>, is undoubtedly true; that it is not capable of being further mellowed without suffering in its force and energy, will scarce be thought by any one who possesses an ear."--<i>Elements of</i> Criticism<i>, Vol. ii, p. 12.</i></p>
<p>OBS. 26.--The following examples are from a letter of an African Prince, translated by Dr. Desaguillier of Cambridge, England, in 1743, and published in a London newspaper: "I lie there too upon the bed <i>thou</i> presented <i>me;"--"After</i> thou <i>left me, in thy swimming house;"--"Those</i> good things <i>thou presented</i> me;"--"When <i>thou spake</i> to the Great Spirit and his Son." If it is desirable that our language should retain this power of a simple literal version of what in others may be familiarly expressed by the second person singular, it is clear that our grammarians must not continue to dogmatize according to the letter of some authors hitherto popular. But not every popular grammar condemns such phraseology as the foregoing. "I improved, Thou <i>improvedst</i>, &amp;c. This termination of the second person preterit, on account of its harshness, <i>is seldom used</i>, and especially in the irregular verbs."--<i>Harrison's Gram.</i>, p. 26. "The termination <i>est</i>, annexed to the preter tenses of verbs, is, at best, a very harsh one, when it is contracted, according to our general custom of throwing out the <i>e</i>; as <i>learnedst</i>, for <i>learnedest</i>; and especially, if it be again contracted into one syllable, <i>as it is commonly pronounced</i>, and made <i>learndst.</i> * * * I believe a writer or speaker would have recourse to any periphrasis rather than say <i>keptest</i>, or <i>keptst</i>. * * * Indeed this harsh termination <i>est</i> is <i>generally quite dropped in common</i> conversation<i>, and sometimes by the poets, in writing."--</i>Priestley's Gram.<i>, p. 115. The fact is, it never was added with much uniformity.</i> Examples: "But like the hell hounde <i>thou waxed</i> fall furious, expressing thy malice when <i>thou</i> to honour <i>stied</i>."--FABIAN'S CHRONICLE, V. ii, p. 522: in <i>Tooke's Divers.</i>, T. ii, p. 232.</p>

</pre>
<p>OBS. 27.--L. Murray, and his numerous copyists, Ingersoll, Greenleaf, Kirkham, Fisk, Flint, Comly, Alger, and the rest; though they insist on it, that the <i>st</i> of the second person can never be dispensed with, except in the imperative mood and some parts of the subjunctive; are not altogether insensible of that monstrous harshness which their doctrine imposes upon the language. Some of them tell us to avoid this by preferring the auxiliaries <i>dost</i> and <i>didst</i>: as <i>dost burst</i>, for <i>burstest; didst</i> check<i>, for</i> checkedst. <i>This recommendation proceeds on the supposition</i> that <i>dost</i> and <i>didst</i> are smoother syllables than <i>est</i> and <i>edst</i>; which is not true: <i>didst learn</i> is harsher than either <i>learnedst</i> or <i>learntest</i>; and all three of them are intolerable in common discourse. Nor is the "<i>energy</i>, or <i>positiveness</i>," which grammarians ascribe to these auxiliaries, always appropriate. Except in a question, <i>dost</i> and <i>didst</i>, like <i>do, does</i>, and <i>did</i>, are usually signs of <i>emphasis</i>; and therefore unfit to be substituted for the <i>st, est</i>, or <i>edst</i>, of an unemphatic verb. Kirkham, who, as we have seen, graces his Elocution with such unutterable things, as "<i>prob'dst, hurl'dst, arm'dst, want'dst, burn'dst,</i> bark'dst, bubbl'dst, troubbl'dst<i>," attributes the use of the plural for</i> the singular, to a design of avoiding the raggedness of the latter. "In order to avoid the disagreeable harshness of sound, occasioned by the frequent recurrence of the termination <i>est, edst</i>, in the adaptation of our verbs to the nominative <i>thou</i>, a <i>modern innovation</i> which substitutes <i>you</i> for <i>thou</i>, in familiar style, has generally been adopted. This innovation contributes greatly to the harmony of our colloquial style. <i>You</i> was formerly restricted to the plural number; but now it is employed to represent either a singular or a plural noun."--<i>Kirkham's Gram.</i>, p. 99. A modern innovation, forsooth! Does not every body know it was current four hundred years ago, or more? Certainly, both <i>ye</i> and <i>you</i> were applied in this manner, to the great, as early as the fourteenth century. Chaucer sometimes used them so, and he died in 1400. Sir T. More uses them so, in a piece dated 1503.</p>

   And when I ask'd <i>you</i> what the matter was,
   <i>You</i> star'd upon me with ungentle looks."--<i>J. Cæsar</i>, Act ii, Sc. 2.
</pre>
<p>OBS. 28.--"There is a natural tendency in all languages to throw out the rugged parts which improper consonants produce, and to preserve those which are melodious and agreeable to the ear."--<i>Gardiner's Music of Nature</i>, p. 29. "The English tongue, so remarkable for its grammatical simplicity, is loaded with a great variety of dull unmeaning terminations. Mr. Sheridan attributes this defect, to an utter inattention to what is easy to the organs of speech and agreeable to the ear; and further adds, that, 'the French having been adopted as the language of the court, no notice was taken, of the spelling or pronunciation of our words, until the reign of queen Anne.' So little was spelling attended to in the time of Elizabeth, that Dr. Johnson informs us, that on referring to Shakspeare's will, to determine how his name was spelt, he was found to have written it himself [in] no <i>less</i> [fewer] than three different ways."--<i>Ib.</i>, p. 477. In old books, our participial or verbal termination <i>ed</i>, is found written in about a dozen different ways; as, <i>ed, de, d, t, id, it, yd, yt, ede, od,</i> ud<i>. For</i> est <i>and</i> eth<i>, we find sometimes the consonants only; sometimes,</i> <i>ist</i> or <i>yst, ith</i> or <i>yth</i>; sometimes, for the latter, <i>oth</i> or <i>ath</i>; and sometimes the ending was omitted altogether. In early times also the <i>th</i> was an ending for verbs of the third person plural, as well as for those of the third person singular;[249] and, in the imperative mood, it was applied to the second person, both singular and plural: as,</p>
<pre>  "<i>Demith</i> thyself, that demist other's dede;
   And trouthe the shall deliver, it's no drede."--<i>Chaucer</i>.
</pre>
<p>OBS. 29.--It must be obvious to every one who has much acquaintance with the history of our language, that this part of its grammar has always been quite as unsettled as it is now; and, however we may wish to establish its principles, it is idle to teach for absolute certainty that which every man's knowledge may confute. Let those who desire to see our forms of conjugation as sure as those of other tongues, study to exemplify in their own practice what tends to uniformity. The best that can be done by the author of a grammar, is, to exhibit usage, as it has been, and as it is; pointing out to the learner what is most fashionable, as well as what is most orderly and agreeable. If by these means the usage of writers and speakers cannot be fixed to what is fittest for their occasions, and therefore most grammatical, there is in grammar no remedy for their inaccuracies; as there is none for the blunders of dull opinionists, none for the absurdities of Ignorance stalled in the seats of Learning. Some grammarians say, that, whenever the preterit of an irregular verb is like the present, it should take <i>edst</i> for the second person singular. This rule, (which is adopted by Walker, in his Principles, No. 372,) gives us such words as <i>cast-edst, cost-edst, bid-dedst, burst-edst, cut-tedst,</i> hit-tedst, let-tedst, put-tedst, hurt-edst, rid-dedst, shed-dedst<i>, &amp;c. But</i> the rule is groundless. The few examples which may be adduced from ancient writings, in support of this principle, are undoubtedly formed in the usual manner from regular preterits now obsolete; and if this were not the case, no person of taste could think of employing, on any occasion, derivatives so uncouth. Dr. Johnson has justly remarked, that "the chief defect of our language, is ruggedness and asperity." And this defect, as some of the foregoing remarks have shown, is peculiarly obvious, when even the regular termination of the second person singular is added to our preterits. Accordingly, we find numerous instances among the poets, both ancient and modern, in which that termination is omitted. See Percy's Reliques of Ancient Poetry, everywhere.</p>

</pre>
<p>OBS. 30.--With the familiar form of the second person singular, those who constantly put <i>you</i> for <i>thou</i> can have no concern; and many may think it unworthy of notice, because Murray has said nothing about it: others will hastily pronounce it bad English, because they have learned at school some scheme of the verb, which implies that this must needs be wrong. It is this partial learning which makes so much explanation here necessary. The formation of this part of speech, form it as you will, is <i>central to</i> grammar<i>, and cannot but be very important. Our language can never entirely</i> drop the pronoun <i>thou</i>, and its derivatives, <i>thy, thine, thee, thyself</i>, without great injury, especially to its poetry. Nor can the distinct syllabic utterance of the termination <i>ed</i> be now generally practised, except in solemn prose. It is therefore better, not to insist on those old verbal forms against which there are so many objections, than to exclude the pronoun of the second person singular from all such usage, whether familiar or poetical, as will not admit them. It is true that on most occasions <i>you</i> may be substituted for <i>thou</i>, without much inconvenience; and so may <i>we</i> be substituted for <i>I</i>, with just as much propriety; though Dr. Perley thinks the latter usage "is not to be encouraged."--<i>Gram.</i>, p. 28. Our authors and editors, like kings and emperors, are making <i>we</i> for <i>I</i> their most common mode of expression. They renounce their individuality to avoid egotism. And when all men shall have adopted this enallage, the fault indeed will be banished, or metamorphosed, but with it will go an other sixth part of every English conjugation. The pronouns in the following couplet are put for the first person singular, the second person singular, and the second person plural; yet nobody will understand them so, but by their antecedents:</p>
<pre>  "Right trusty, and so forth--<i>we</i> let <i>you</i> to know
   <i>We</i> are very ill used by <i>you mortals</i> below."--<i>Swift.</i>
</pre>
<p>OBS. 31.--It is remarkable that some, who forbear to use the plural for the singular in the second person, adopt it without scruple, in the first. The figure is the same in both; and in both, sufficiently common. Neither practice is worthy to be made more general than it now is. If <i>thou</i> should not be totally sacrificed to what was once a vain compliment, neither should <i>I</i>, to what is now an occasional, and perhaps a vain assumption. Lindley Murray, who does not appear to have used <i>you</i> for <i>thou</i>, and who was sometimes singularly careful to periphrase [sic--KTH] and avoid the latter, nowhere in his grammar speaks of himself in the first person singular. He is often "the <i>Compiler</i>;" rarely, "the <i>Author</i>;" generally, "We:" as, "<i>We</i> have distributed these parts of grammar, in the mode which <i>we</i> think most correct and intelligible."--<i>Octavo Gram.</i>, p. 58. "<i>We</i> shall not pursue this subject any further."--<i>Ib.</i>, p. 62. "<i>We</i> shall close these remarks on the tenses."--<i>Ib.</i>, p. 76. "<i>We</i> presume no solid objection can be made."--<i>Ib.</i>, p. 78. "The observations which <i>we</i> have made."--<i>Ib.</i>, p. 100. "<i>We</i> shall produce a remarkable example of this beauty from Milton."--<i>Ib.</i>, p. 331. "<i>We</i> have now given sufficient openings into this subject."--<i>Ib.</i>, p. 334. This usage has authority enough; for it was not uncommon even among the old Latin grammarians; but he must be a slender scholar, who thinks the pronoun <i>we</i> thereby becomes <i>singular.</i> What advantage or fitness there is in thus putting <i>we</i> for <i>I</i>, the reader may judge. Dr. Blair did not hesitate to use <i>I</i>, as often as ho had occasion; neither did Lowth, or Johnson, or Walker, or Webster: as, "<i>I</i> shall produce a remarkable example of this beauty from Milton."--<i>Blair's Rhet.</i>, p. 129. "<i>I</i> have now given sufficient openings into this subject."--<i>Ib.</i>, p. 131. So in Lowth's Preface: "<i>I</i> believe,"--"<i>I</i> am persuaded,"--"<i>I</i> am sure,"--"<i>I</i> think,"--"<i>I</i> am afraid,"--"<i>I</i> will not take upon <i>me</i> to say."</p>
<p>OBS. 32.--Intending to be critical without hostility, and explicit without partiality, I write not for or against any sect, or any man; but to teach all who desire to know <i>the grammar</i> of our tongue. The student must distinctly understand, that it is necessary to speak and write differently, according to the different circumstances or occasions of writing. Who is he that will pretend that the solemn style of the Bible may be used in familiar discourse, without a mouthing affectation? In preaching, or in praying, the ancient terminations of <i>est</i> for the second person singular and <i>eth</i> for the third, as well as <i>ed</i> pronounced as a separate syllable for the preterit, are admitted to be generally in better taste than the smoother forms of the familiar style: because the latter, though now frequently heard in religious assemblies, are not so well suited to the dignity and gravity of a sermon or a prayer. In grave poetry also, especially when it treats of scriptural subjects, to which <i>you</i> put for <i>thou</i> is obviously unsuitable, the personal terminations of the verb, though from the earliest times to the present day they have usually been contracted and often omitted by the poets, ought still perhaps to be considered grammatically necessary, whenever they can be uttered, agreeably to the notion of our tuneless critics. The critical objection to their elision, however, can have no very firm foundation while it is admitted by some of the objectors themselves, that, "Writers <i>generally</i> have recourse to this mode of expression, that they may avoid harsh terminations."-- <i>Irving's Elements of English Composition</i>, p. 12. But if writers of good authority, such as Pope, Byron, and Pollok, have sometimes had recourse to this method of simplifying the verb, even in compositions of a grave cast, the elision may, with tenfold stronger reason, be admitted in familiar writing or discourse, on the authority of general custom among those who choose to employ the pronoun <i>thou</i> in conversation.</p>

</pre>
<p>OBS. 33.--Some of the Friends (perhaps from an idea that it is less formal) misemploy <i>thee</i> for <i>thou</i>; and often join it to the third person of the verb in stead of the second. Such expressions as, <i>thee does, thee is, thee</i> has, thee thinks<i>, &amp;c., are double solecisms; they set all grammar at</i> defiance. Again, many persons who are not ignorant of grammar, and who employ the pronoun aright, sometimes improperly sacrifice concord to a slight improvement in sound, and give to the verb the ending of the third person, for that of the second. Three or four instances of this, occur in the examples which have been already quoted. See also the following, and many more, in the works of the poet Burns; who says of himself, "Though it cost the schoolmaster some thrashings, I made an excellent English scholar; and, by the time I was ten or eleven years of age, I was a critic in substantives, VERBS, and particles:"--"But when thou <i>pours</i>;"--"There thou <i>shines</i> chief;"--"Thou <i>clears</i> the head;"--"Thou <i>strings</i> the nerves;"--"Thou <i>brightens</i> black despair;"--"Thou <i>comes</i>;"--"Thou <i>travels</i> far;"--"Now <i>thou's turned</i> out;"--"Unseen thou <i>lurks</i>;"--"O thou pale orb that silent <i>shines</i>." This mode of simplifying the verb, confounds the persons; and, as it has little advantage in sound, over the regular contracted form of the second person, it ought to be avoided. With this author it may be, perhaps, a Scotticism: as,</p>
<pre>  "Thou <i>paints</i> auld nature to the nines,
   In thy sweet Caledonian lines."--<i>Burns to Ramsay</i>.
</pre>
<p>"Thou <i>paintst old</i> nature," would be about as smooth poetry, and certainly much better English. This confounding of the persons of the verb, however, is no modern peculiarity. It appears to be about as old as the use of <i>s</i> for <i>th</i> or <i>eth</i>. Spenser, the great English poet of the sixteenth century, may be cited in proof: as,</p>
<pre>  "Siker, <i>thou's</i> but a lazy loord,
   And <i>rekes</i> much of thy swinke."--<i>Joh. Dict., w. Loord</i>.
</pre>
<p>OBS. 34.--In the solemn style, (except in poetry, which usually contracts these forms,) the second person singular of the present indicative, and that of the irregular preterits, commonly end in <i>est</i>, pronounced as a separate syllable, and requiring the duplication of the final consonant, according to Rule 3d for Spelling: as, I <i>run</i>, thou <i>runnest</i>; I <i>ran</i>, thou <i>rannest</i>. But as the termination <i>ed</i>, in solemn discourse, constitutes a syllable, the regular preterits form the second person singular by assuming <i>st</i>, without further increase of syllables: as, I <i>loved</i>, thou <i>lovedst</i>; not, "<i>lovedest</i>," as Chandler made it in his English Grammar, p. 41, Edition of 1821; and as Wells's rule, above cited, if literally taken, would make it. <i>Dost</i> and <i>hast</i>, and the three irregular preterits, <i>wast, didst</i>, and <i>hadst</i>, are permanently contracted; though <i>doest</i> and <i>diddest</i> are sometimes seen in old books. <i>Saidst</i> is more common, and perhaps more regular, than <i>saidest. Werest</i> has long been contracted into <i>wert</i>: "I would thou <i>werest</i> either cold or hot."--<i>W. Perkins</i>, 1608.[251] The auxiliaries <i>shall</i> and <i>will</i> change the final <i>l</i> to <i>t</i>, and become <i>shalt</i> and <i>wilt</i>. To the auxiliaries, <i>may, can, might, could, would</i>, and <i>should</i>, the termination <i>est</i> was formerly added; but they are now generally written with <i>st</i> only, and pronounced as monosyllables, even in solemn discourse. Murray, in quoting the Scriptures, very often charges <i>mayest</i> to <i>mayst, mightest</i> to <i>mightst</i>, &amp;c. Some other permanent contractions are occasionally met with, in what many grammarians call the solemn style; as <i>bidst</i> for <i>biddest,</i> fledst <i>for</i> fleddest, satst <i>for</i> sattest<i>:</i></p>
<pre>  "Riding sublime, thou <i>bidst</i> the world adore,
   And humblest nature with thy northern blast."
       --<i>Thomson</i>.
</pre>
<pre>   "Fly thither whence thou <i>fledst</i>."
        --<i>Milton, P. L.</i>, B. iv, l. 963.
</pre>
<pre>   "Unspeakable, who <i>sitst</i> above these heavens."
       --<i>Id., ib.</i>, B. v, l. 156.
</pre>
<pre>   "Why <i>satst</i> thou like an enemy in wait?"
       --<i>Id., ib.</i>, B. iv, l. 825.
</pre>
<p>OBS. 35.--The formation of the third person singular of verbs, is <i>now</i> precisely the same as that of the plural number of nouns: as, <i>love, loves;</i> show, shows; boast, boasts; fly, flies; reach, reaches<i>. This form began to</i> be used about the beginning of the sixteenth century. The ending seems once to have been <i>es</i>, sounded as <i>s</i> or <i>z</i>: as,</p>
<pre>  "And thus I see among these pleasant thynges
   Eche care <i>decayes</i>, and yet my sorrow <i>sprynges</i>."--<i>Earl of Surry</i>.
</pre>
<pre>   "With throte yrent, he <i>roares</i>, he <i>lyeth</i> along."--<i>Sir T. Wyat</i>.
</pre>
<pre>   "He <i>dyeth</i>, he is all dead, he <i>pantes</i>, he <i>restes</i>."--<i>Id.</i>, 1540.
</pre>
<p>In all these instances, the <i>e</i> before the <i>s</i> has become improper. The <i>es</i> does not here form a syllable; neither does the <i>eth</i>, in "<i>lyeth</i>" and "<i>dyeth</i>." In very ancient times, the third person singular appears to have been formed by adding <i>th</i> or <i>eth</i> nearly as we now add <i>s</i> or <i>es</i>[252] Afterwards, as in our common Bible, it was formed by adding <i>th</i> to verbs ending in <i>e</i>, and <i>eth</i> to all others; as, "For he that <i>eateth</i> and <i>drinketh</i> unworthily, <i>eateth</i> and <i>drinketh</i> damnation to himself."--<i>1 Cor.</i>, xi, 29. "He <i>quickeneth</i> man, who is dead in trespasses and sins; he <i>keepeth</i> alive the quickened soul, and <i>leadeth</i> it in the paths of life; he <i>scattereth, subdueth</i>, and <i>conquereth</i> the enemies of the soul."--<i>I. Penington</i>. This method of inflection, as now pronounced, always adds a syllable to the verb. It is entirely confined to the solemn style, and is little used. <i>Doth, hath</i>, and <i>saith</i>, appear to be permanent contractions of verbs thus formed. In the days of Shakspeare, both terminations were common, and he often mixed them, in a way which is not very proper now: as,</p>
<pre>  "The quality of mercy is not strained;
   It <i>droppeth</i>, as the gentle rain from heaven
   Upon the place beneath: it is twice bless'd;
   It <i>blesseth</i> him that <i>gives</i>, and him that <i>takes</i>."
       --<i>Merchant of Venice</i>.
</pre>
<p>OBS. 36.--When the second person singular is employed in familiar discourse, with any regard to correctness, it is usually formed in a manner strictly analogous to that which is now adopted in the third person singular. When the verb ends with a sound which will unite with that of <i>st</i> or <i>s</i>, the second person singular is formed by adding <i>s</i> only, and the third, by adding <i>s</i> only; and the number of syllables is not increased: as, I <i>read</i>, thou <i>readst</i>, he <i>reads</i>; I <i>know</i>, thou <i>knowst</i>, he <i>knows</i>; I <i>take</i>, thou <i>takest</i>, he <i>takes</i>; I <i>free</i>, thou <i>freest</i>, he <i>frees</i>. For, when the verb ends in mute <i>a</i>, no termination renders this <i>a</i> vocal in the familiar style, if a synæresis can take place. To prevent their readers from ignorantly assuming the pronunciation of the solemn style, the poets have generally marked such words with an apostrophe: as,</p>
<pre>  "Look what thy soul holds dear, imagine it
   To lie the way thou <i>go'st</i>, not whence thou <i>com'st</i>."--<i>Shak</i>.
</pre>
<p>OBS. 37.--But when the verb ends in a sound which will not unite with that of <i>st</i> or <i>s</i>, the second and third persons are formed by adding <i>est</i> and <i>es</i>; or, if the first person end in mute <i>e</i>, the <i>st</i> and <i>s</i> render that <i>e</i> vocal; so that the verb acquires an additional syllable: as, I <i>trace</i>, thou <i>tracest</i>, he <i>traces</i>; I <i>pass</i>, thou <i>passest</i>, he <i>passes</i>; I <i>fix</i>, thou <i>fixest</i>, he <i>fixes</i>; I <i>preach</i>, thou <i>preachest</i>, he <i>preaches</i>; I <i>blush</i>, thou <i>blushest</i>, he <i>blushes</i>; I <i>judge</i>, thou <i>judgest</i>, he <i>judges</i>. But verbs ending in <i>o</i> or <i>y</i> preceded by a consonant, do not exactly follow either of the foregoing rules. In these, <i>y</i> is changed into <i>i</i>; and, to both <i>o</i> and <i>i, est</i> and <i>es</i> are added without increase of syllables: as, I <i>go</i>, thou <i>goest</i>, he <i>goes</i>; I <i>undo</i>, thou <i>undoest</i>,[253] he <i>undoes</i>; I <i>fly</i>, thou <i>fliest</i>, he <i>flies</i>; I <i>pity</i>, thou <i>pitiest</i>, he <i>pities</i>. Thus, in the following lines, <i>goest</i> must be pronounced like <i>ghost</i>; otherwise, we spoil the measure of the verse:</p>
<pre>  "Thou <i>goest</i> not now with battle, and the voice
   Of war, as once against the rebel hosts;
   Thou <i>goest</i> a Judge, and <i>findst</i> the guilty bound;
   Thou <i>goest</i> to prove, condemn, acquit, reward."--<i>Pollok</i>, B. x.
</pre>
<p>In solemn prose, however, the termination is here made a separate syllable: as, I <i>go</i>, thou <i>goëst</i>, he <i>goëth</i>; I <i>undo</i>, thou <i>undoëst</i>, he <i>undoëth</i>; I <i>fly</i>, thou <i>fliëst</i>, he <i>fliëth</i>; I <i>pity</i>, thou <i>pitiëst</i>, he <i>pitiëth</i>.</p>
<p>OBS. 38.--The auxiliaries <i>do, dost, does</i>,--(pronounced <i>doo, dust, duz</i>; and not as the words <i>dough, dosed, doze</i>,--) <i>am, art, is,--have, hast,</i> has<i>,--being also in frequent use as principal verbs of the present tense,</i> retain their peculiar forms, with distinction of person and number, when they help to form the compound tenses of other verbs. The other auxiliaries are not varied, or ought not to be varied, except in the solemn style. Example of the familiar use: "That thou <i>may</i> be found truly owning it."--<i>Barclay's Works</i>, Vol. i, p. 234.</p>
<p>OBS. 39.--The only regular terminations that are added to English verbs, are <i>ing, d</i> or <i>e, st</i> or <i>est, s</i> or <i>es, th</i> or <i>eth</i>[254] <i>Ing</i>, and <i>th</i> or <i>eth</i>, always add a syllable to the verb; except in <i>doth, hath,</i> saith<i>.[255] The rest, whenever their sound will unite with that of the</i> final syllable of the verb, are usually added without increasing the number of syllables; otherwise, they are separately pronounced. In solemn discourse, however, <i>ed</i> and <i>est</i> are by most speakers uttered distinctly in all cases; except sometimes when a vowel precedes: as in <i>sanctified,</i> glorified<i>, which are pronounced as three syllables only. Yet, in spite of</i> this analogy, many readers will have <i>sanctifiest</i> and <i>glorifiest</i> to be words of four syllables. If this pronunciation is proper, it is only so in solemn prose. The prosody of verse will show how many syllables the poets make: as,</p>
<pre>  "Thou <i>diedst</i>, a most rare boy, of melancholy!"
       --<i>Shak., Cymb.</i>, Act iv, sc. 2.
</pre>
<pre>   "Had not a voice thus warn'd me: What thou <i>seest</i>,
   What there thou <i>seest</i>, fair creature, is thyself."
       --<i>Milton</i>, B. iv, l. 467.
</pre>
<pre>   "By those thou <i>wooedst</i> from death to endless life."
       --<i>Pollok</i>, B. ix, l. 7.
</pre>
<pre>   "Attend: that thou art happy, owe to God;
   That thou <i>continuest</i> such, owe to thyself"
       --<i>Milton</i>, B. v, l. 520.
</pre>
<p>OBS. 40.--If the grave and full form of the second person singular must needs be supposed to end rather with the syllable <i>est</i> than with <i>st</i> only, it is certain that this form may be <i>contracted</i>, whenever the verb ends in a sound which will unite with that of <i>st</i>. The poets generally employ the briefer or contracted forms; but they seem not to have adopted a uniform and consistent method of writing them. Some usually insert the apostrophe, and, after a single vowel, double the final consonant before <i>st</i>; as, <i>hold'st, bidd'st, said'st, ledd'st, wedd'st, trimm'st, may'st,</i> might'st<i>, and so forth: others, in numerous instances, add</i> st <i>only, and</i> form permanent contractions; as, <i>holdst, bidst, saidst, ledst, wedst,</i> trimst, mayst, mightst<i>, and so forth. Some retain the vowel</i> e<i>, in the</i> termination of certain words, and suppress a preceding one; as, <i>quick'nest, happ'nest, scatt'rest, rend'rest, rend'redst, slumb'rest,</i> slumb'redst<i>: others contract the termination of such words, and insert the</i> apostrophe; as, <i>quicken'st, happen'st, scatter'st, render'st, render'dst,</i> slumber'st, slumber'dst<i>. The nature and idiom of our language, "the accent</i> and pronunciation of it," incline us to abbreviate or "contract even all our regular verbs;" so as to avoid, if possible, an increase of syllables in the inflection of them. Accordingly, several terminations which formerly constituted distinct syllables, have been either wholly dropped, or blended with the final syllables of the verbs to which they are added. Thus the plural termination <i>en</i> has become entirely obsolete; <i>th</i> or <i>eth</i> is no longer in common use; <i>ed</i> is contracted in pronunciation; the ancient <i>ys</i> or <i>is</i>, of the third person singular, is changed to <i>s</i> or <i>es</i>, and is usually added without increase of syllables; and <i>st</i> or <i>est</i> has, in part, adopted the analogy. So that the proper mode of forming these contractions of the second person singular, seems to be, to add <i>st</i> only; and to insert no apostrophe, unless a vowel is suppressed from the verb to which this termination is added: as, <i>thinkst, sayst, bidst, sitst, satst,</i> lov'st, lov'dst, slumberst, slumber'dst<i>.</i></p>

   Thou shalt be made to answer at the bar."--<i>Cotton</i>.
</pre>
<p>OBS. 41.--Ho man deserves more praise for his attention to English pronunciation, than John Walker. His Pronouncing Dictionary was, for a long period, the best standard of orthoëpy, that our schools possessed. But he seems to me to have missed a figure, in preferring such words as <i>quick'nest, strength'nest</i>, to the smoother and more regular forms, <i>quickenst, strengthenst</i>. It is true that these are rough words, in any form you can give them; but let us remember, that needless apostrophes are as rough to the eye, as needless <i>st'</i>s to the ear. Our common grammarians are disposed to encumber the language with as many of both as they can find any excuse for, and vastly more than can be sustained by any good argument. In words that are well understood to be contracted in pronunciation, the apostrophe is now less frequently used than it was formerly. Walker says, "This contraction of the participial <i>ed</i>, and the verbal <i>en</i>, is so fixed an idiom of our pronunciation, that to alter it, would be to alter the sound of the whole language. It must, however, be regretted that it subjects our tongue to some of the most hissing, snapping, clashing, grinding sounds that ever grated the ears of a Vandal; thus, <i>rasped,</i> scratched, wrenched, bridled, fangled, birchen, hardened, strengthened, quickened<i>, &amp;c. almost frighten us when written as they are actually</i> pronounced, as <i>rapt, scratcht, wrencht, bridl'd, fangl'd, birch'n,</i> strength'n'd, quick'n'd<i>, &amp;c.; they become still more formidable when used</i> contractedly in the solemn style, which never ought to be the case; for here instead of <i>thou strength'n'st</i> or <i>strength'n'd'st, thou quick'n'st</i> or <i>quick'n'd'st</i>, we ought to pronounce <i>thou strength'nest</i> or <i>strength'nedst, thou quick'nest</i> or <i>quick'nedst</i>, which are sufficiently harsh of all conscience."--<i>Principles</i>, No. 359. Here are too many apostrophes; for it does not appear that such words as <i>strengthenedest</i> and <i>quickenedest</i> ever existed, except in the imagination of certain grammarians. In solemn prose one may write, <i>thou quickenest, thou</i> strengthenest<i>, or</i> thou quickenedst, thou strengthenedst<i>; but, in the</i> familiar style, or in poetry, it is better to write, <i>thou quickenst, thou</i> strengthenst, thou quickened, thou strengthened<i>. This is language which it</i> is possible to utter; and it is foolish to strangle ourselves with strings of rough consonants, merely because they are insisted on by some superficial grammarians. Is it not strange, is it not incredible, that the same hand should have written the two following lines, in the same sentence? Surely, the printer has been at fault.</p>
<pre>  "With noiseless foot, thou <i>walkedst</i> the vales of earth"--
   "Most honourable thou <i>appeared</i>, and most
   To be desired."--<i>Pollok's Course of Time</i>, B. ix, l. 18, and l. 24.
</pre>
<p>OBS. 42.--It was once a very common practice, to retain the final <i>y</i>, in contractions of the preterit or of the second person of most verbs that end in <i>y</i>, and to add the consonant terminations <i>d, st</i>, and <i>dst</i>, with an apostrophe before each; as, <i>try'd</i> for <i>tried, reply'd</i> for <i>replied,</i> try'st <i>for</i> triest, try'dst <i>for</i> triedst<i>. Thus Milton:--</i></p>
<pre>  "Thou following <i>cry'dst</i> aloud, Return, fair Eve;
   Whom <i>fly'st</i> thou? whom thou <i>fly'st</i>, of him thou art."
       --<i>P. L.</i>, B. iv, l. 481.
</pre>
<p>This usage, though it may have been of some advantage as an index to the pronunciation of the words, is a palpable departure from the common rule for spelling such derivatives. That rule is, "The final <i>y</i> of a primitive word, when preceded by a consonant, is changed into <i>i</i> before an additional termination." The works of the British poets, except those of the present century, abound with contractions like the foregoing; but late authors, or their printers, have returned to the rule; and the former practice is wearing out and becoming obsolete. Of regular verbs that end in <i>ay, ey</i>, or <i>oy</i>, we have more than half a hundred; all of which usually retain the <i>y</i> in their derivatives, agreeably to an other of the rules for spelling. The preterits of these we form by adding <i>ed</i> without increase of syllables; as, <i>display, displayed; survey, surveyed; enjoy, enjoyed</i>. These also, in both tenses, may take <i>st</i> without increase of syllables; as, <i>display'st, display'dst</i>; <i>survey'st, survey'dst; enjoy'st,</i> enjoy'dst<i>. All these forms, and such as these, are still commonly</i> considered contractions, and therefore written with the apostrophe; but if the termination <i>st</i> is sufficient of itself to mark the second person singular, as it certainly is considered to be as regards one half of them, and as it certainly was in the Saxon tongue still more generally, then for the other half there is no need of the apostrophe, because nothing is omitted. <i>Est</i>, like <i>es</i>, is generally a syllabic termination; but <i>st</i>, like <i>s</i>, is not. As signs of the third person, the <i>s</i> and the <i>es</i> are always considered equivalent; and, as signs of the second person, the <i>st</i> and the <i>est</i> are sometimes, and ought to be always, considered so too. To all verbs that admit the sound, we add the <i>s</i> without marking it as a contraction for <i>es</i>; and there seems to be no reason at all against adding the <i>st</i> in like manner, whenever we choose to form the second person without adding a syllable to the verb. The foregoing observations I commend to the particular attention of all those who hope to write such English as shall do them honour--to every one who, from a spark of literary ambition, may say of himself,</p>

<p><br>
THE CONJUGATION OF VERBS.</p>
<p>The conjugation of a verb is a regular arrangement of its moods, tenses, persons, numbers, and participles.</p>
<p>There are four PRINCIPAL PARTS in the conjugation of every simple and complete verb; namely, the <i>Present</i>, the <i>Preterit</i>, the <i>Imperfect</i> Participle<i>, and the</i> Perfect Participle<i>.[256] A verb which wants any of</i> these parts, is called <i>defective</i>; such are most of the auxiliaries.</p>
<p>An <i>auxiliary</i> is a short verb prefixed to one of the principal parts of an other verb, to express some particular mode and time of the being, action, or passion. The auxiliaries are <i>do, be, have, shall, will, may, can</i>, and <i>must</i>, with their variations.</p>
<p><br>
OBSERVATIONS.</p>
<p>OBS. 1.--The <i>present</i>, or the verb in the present tense, is radically the same in all the moods, and is the part from which all the rest are formed. The present infinitive is commonly considered <i>the root</i>, or <i>simplest</i> form<i>, of the English verb. We usually place the</i> preposition <i>TO</i> before it; but never when with an auxiliary it forms a compound tense that is not infinitive: there are also some other exceptions, which plainly show, that the word <i>to</i> is neither a part of the verb, as Cobbett, R. C. Smith, S. Kirkham, and Wells, say it is; nor a part of the infinitive mood, as Hart and many others will have it to be, but a distinct <i>preposition</i>. (See, in the <i>Syntax</i> of this work, Observations on Rule 18th.) The preterit and the perfect participle are regularly formed by adding <i>d</i> or <i>ed</i>, and the imperfect participle, by adding <i>ing</i>, to the present.</p>
<p>OBS. 2.--The moods and tenses, in English, are formed partly by inflections, or changes made in the verb itself, and partly by the combination of the verb or its participle, with a few short verbs, called <i>auxiliaries</i>, or <i>helping verbs</i>. This view of the subject, though disputed by some, is sustained by such a preponderance both of authority and of reason, that I shall not trouble the reader with any refutation of those who object to it. Murray the schoolmaster observes, "In the English language, the times and modes of verbs are expressed in a perfect, easy, and beautiful manner, by the aid of a few little words called <i>auxiliaries</i>, or <i>helping verbs</i>. The possibility of a thing is expressed by <i>can</i> or <i>could</i>; the liberty to do a thing, by <i>may</i> or <i>might</i>; the inclination of the will, by <i>will</i> or <i>would</i>; the necessity of a thing, by <i>must</i> or <i>ought, shall</i> or <i>should</i>. The preposition <i>to</i> is never expressed after the helping verbs, except after <i>ought</i>."--<i>Alex. Murray's</i> Gram.<i>, p. 112. See nearly the same words in</i> Buchanan's English Syntax<i>,</i> p. 36; and in <i>the British Gram.</i>, p. 125.</p>
<p>OBS. 3.--These authors are wrong in calling <i>ought</i> a helping verb, and so is Oliver B. Peirce, in calling "<i>ought to</i>," and "<i>ought to have</i>" auxiliaries; for no auxiliary ever admits the preposition <i>to</i> after it or into it: and Murray of Holdgate is no less in fault, for calling <i>let</i> an auxiliary; because no mere auxiliary ever governs the objective case. The sentences, "He <i>ought</i> to <i>help</i> you," and, "<i>Let</i> him <i>help</i> you," severally involve two different moods: they are equivalent to, "It <i>is his</i> duty <i>to</i> help <i>you;"--"</i>Permit <i>him</i> to help <i>you." Hence</i> ought <i>and</i> <i>let</i> are not auxiliaries, but principal verbs.</p>
<p>OBS. 4.--Though most of the auxiliaries are defective, when compared with other verbs; yet these three, <i>do, be</i>, and <i>have</i>, being also principal verbs, are complete: but the participles of <i>do</i> and <i>have</i> are not used as auxiliaries; unless <i>having</i>, which helps to form the third or "compound perfect" participle, (as <i>having loved</i>,) may be considered such. The other auxiliaries have no participles.</p>
<p>OBS. 5.--English verbs are principally conjugated by means of auxiliaries; the only tenses which can be formed by the simple verb, being the present and the imperfect; as, I <i>love</i>, I <i>loved</i>. And even here an auxiliary is usually preferred in questions and negations; as, "<i>Do</i> you love?"--"You <i>do</i> not <i>love</i>." "<i>Did</i> he <i>love</i>?"--"He <i>did</i> not <i>love</i>." "<i>Do</i> I not yet <i>grieve</i>?"--"<i>Did</i> she not <i>die</i>?" All the other tenses, even in their simplest form, are compounds.</p>
<p>OBS. 6.--Dr. Johnson says, "<i>Do</i> is sometimes used superfluously, as <i>I</i> do <i>love, I</i> did <i>love</i>; simply for <i>I love</i>, or <i>I loved</i>; but this is considered as a <i>vitious</i> mode of speech."--<i>Gram., in 4to Dict.</i>, p. 8. He also somewhere tells us, that these auxiliaries "are not proper before <i>be</i> and <i>have</i>;" as, "<i>I do be</i>," for <i>I am</i>; "<i>I did have</i>," for <i>I had</i>. The latter remark is generally true, and it ought to be remembered;[257] but, in the <i>imperative mood, be</i> and <i>have</i> will perhaps admit the emphatic word <i>do</i> before them, in a colloquial style: as, "Now <i>do be</i> careful;"--"<i>Do have</i> a little discretion." Sanborn repeatedly puts <i>do</i> before <i>be</i>, in this mood: as, "<i>Do</i> you <i>be. Do</i> you <i>be</i> guarded. <i>Do</i> thou <i>be. Do</i> thou <i>be</i> guarded."--<i>Analytical Gram.</i>, p. 150. "<i>Do</i> thou <i>be</i> watchful."--<i>Ib.</i>, p. 155. In these instances, he must have forgotten that he had elsewhere said positively, that, "<i>Do</i>, as an auxiliary, <i>is</i> never used <i>with the verb</i> be <i>or</i> am<i>."--</i>Ib.<i>, p. 112. In the other</i> moods, it is seldom, if ever, proper before <i>be</i>; but it is sometimes used before <i>have</i>, especially with a negative: as, "Those modes of charity which <i>do not have</i> in view the cultivation of moral excellence, are essentially defective."--<i>Wayland's Moral Science</i>, p. 428. "Surely, the law of God, whether natural or revealed, <i>does not have</i> respect merely to the external conduct of men."--<i>Stuart's Commentary on Romans</i>, p. 158. "And each day of our lives <i>do we have</i> occasion to see and lament it."--<i>Dr. Bartlett's Lecture on Health</i>, p. 5. "Verbs, in themselves considered, <i>do not have</i> person and number."--<i>R. C. Smith's New Gram.</i>, p. 21. [This notion of Smith's is absurd. Kirkham taught the same as regards "person."] In the following example, <i>does he</i> is used for <i>is</i>,--the auxiliary <i>is</i>,--and perhaps allowably: "It is certain from scripture, that the same person <i>does</i> in the course of life many times offend and <i>be</i> forgiven."--<i>West's Letters to a Young Lady</i>, p. 182.</p>
<p>OBS. 7.--In the compound tenses, there is never any variation of ending for the different persons and numbers, except in the <i>first auxiliary</i>: as, "Thou <i>wilt have finished</i> it;" not, "Thou <i>wilt hast finishedst</i> it;" for this is nonsense. And even for the former, it is better to say, in the familiar style, "Thou <i>will have finished</i> it;" for it is characteristic of many of the auxiliaries, that, unlike other verbs, they are not varied by <i>s</i> or <i>eth</i>, in the third person singular, and never by <i>st</i> or <i>est</i>, in the second person singular, except in the solemn style. Thus all the auxiliaries of the potential mood, as well as <i>shall</i> and <i>will</i> of the indicative, are without inflection in the third person singular, though <i>will</i>, as a principal verb, makes <i>wills</i> or <i>willeth</i>, as well as <i>willest</i>, in the indicative present. Hence there appears a tendency in the language, to confine the inflection of its verbs to <i>this tense only</i>; and to the auxiliary <i>have, hast, has</i>, which is essentially present, though used with a participle to form the perfect. <i>Do, dost, does</i>, and <i>am, art,</i> is<i>, whether used as auxiliaries or as principal verbs, are always of the</i> indicative present.</p>
<p>OBS. 8.--The word <i>need</i>,--(though, as a principal verb and transitive, it is unquestionably both regular and complete,--having all the requisite parts, <i>need, needed, needing, needed</i>,--and being necessarily inflected in the indicative present, as, I <i>need</i>, thou <i>needst</i> or <i>needest</i>, he <i>needs</i> or <i>needeth</i>,--) is so frequently used without inflection, when placed before an other verb to express a necessity of the being, action, or passion, that one may well question whether it has not become, under these circumstances, an <i>auxiliary</i> of the potential mood; and therefore proper to be used, like all the other auxiliaries of this mood, without change of termination. I have not yet knowingly used it so myself, nor does it appear to have been classed with the auxiliaries, by any of our grammarians, except Webster.[258] I shall therefore not presume to say now, with positiveness, that it deserves this rank; (though I incline to think it does;) but rather quote such instances as have occurred to me in reading, and leave the student to take his choice, whether to condemn as bad English the uninflected examples, or to justify them in this manner.

   Admits no cure, it <i>needs</i> not to displease."--<i>Ib.</i>, p. 14.
</pre>
<p>OBS. 9.--If <i>need</i> is to be recognized as an auxiliary of the potential mood, it must be understood to belong to two tenses; the present and the perfect; like <i>may, can</i>, and <i>must</i>: as, "He <i>need</i> not <i>go</i>, he <i>need</i> not <i>have gone</i>; Thou <i>need</i> not <i>go, Thou need</i> not <i>have gone</i>;" or, in the solemn style, "Thou <i>needst</i> not go, Thou <i>needst</i> not <i>have gone</i>." If, on the contrary, we will have it to be always a principal verb, the distinction of time should belong to itself, and also the distinction of person and number, in the parts which require it: as, "He <i>needs</i> not go. He <i>needed</i> not go; Thou <i>needst</i> not go, Thou <i>needed</i> not go;" or, in the solemn style, "Thou <i>needest</i> not go, Thou <i>neededst</i> not go." Whether it can be right to say, "He <i>needed</i> not <i>have gone</i>," is at least questionable. From the observations of Murray, upon relative tenses, under his thirteenth rule of syntax, it seems fair to infer that he would have judged this phraseology erroneous. Again, "He <i>needs</i> not <i>have gone</i>," appears to be yet more objectionable, though for the same reason. And if, "He <i>need</i> not <i>have gone</i>," is a correct expression, <i>need</i> is clearly proved to be an <i>auxiliary</i>, and the three words taken together must form the potential perfect. And so of the plural; for the argument is from the connexion of the tenses, and not merely from the tendency of auxiliaries to reject inflection: as, "They need not <i>have been</i> under great concern about their public affairs."--<i>Hutchinson's History</i>, i, 194, From these examples, it may be seen that an auxiliary and a principal verb have some essential difference; though these who dislike the doctrine of compound tenses, pretend not to discern any. Take some further citations; a few of which are erroneous in respect to time. And observe also that the regular verb sometimes admits the preposition <i>to</i> after it: "' There is great dignity in being waited for,' said one who had the habit of tardiness, and who <i>had</i> not much else of which he <i>need</i> be vain."--<i>Students Manual</i>, p. 64. "But he <i>needed</i> not <i>have gone</i> so far for more instances."-- <i>Johnson's Gram.</i> <i>Com.</i>, p. 143.

"It <i>need</i> not <i>have been</i> so."--<i>Ib.</i>, p. 111. "The most unaccommodating politician <i>need</i> not absolutely <i>want</i> friends."--<i>Hunts Feast of the Poets</i>, p. iii.

<p>OBS. 10.--The auxiliaries, except <i>must</i>, which is invariable, have severally two forms in respect to tense, or time; and when inflected in the second and third persons singular, are usually varied in the following manner:--</p>

<p><i>Sing</i>. I have, thou hast, he has; <i>Plur</i>. We have, you have, they have.</p>
<p>IMPERFECT TENSE; BUT SIGN OF THE INDICATIVE PLUPERFECT.</p>
<p><i>Sing</i>. I had, thou hadst, he had; <i>Plur</i>. We had, you had, they had.</p>
<p><br>
SHALL AND WILL.</p>
<p>These auxiliaries have distinct meanings, and, as signs of the future, they are interchanged thus:</p>
<p>PRESENT TENSE; BUT SIGNS OF THE INDICATIVE FIRST-FUTURE.</p>
<p>1. Simply to express a future action or event:--</p>
<p><i>Sing</i>. I shall, thou wilt, he will; <i>Plur</i>. We shall, you will, they will.</p>
<p>2. To express a promise, command, or threat:--</p>
<p><i>Sing</i>.: I will, thou shalt, he shall; <i>Plur</i>. We will, you shall, they shall.</p>
<p>IMPERFECT TENSE; BUT, AS SIGNS, AORIST, OR INDEFINITE.</p>
<p>1. Used with reference to duty or expediency:--</p>
<p><i>Sing.</i> I should, thou shouldst, he should; <i>Plur.</i> We should, you should, they should.</p>
<p>2. Used with reference to volition or desire:--</p>
<p><i>Sing.</i> I would, thou wouldst, he would; <i>Plur.</i> We would, you would, they would.</p>
<p><br>
MAY.</p>
<p>PRESENT TENSE; AND SIGN OF THE POTENTIAL PRESENT.</p>
<p><i>Sing.</i> I may, thou mayst, he may; <i>Plur.</i> We may, you may, they may.</p>
<p>IMPERFECT TENSE; AND SIGN OF THE POTENTIAL IMPERFECT.</p>
<p><i>Sing.</i> I might, thou mightst, he might; <i>Plur.</i> We might, you might, they might.</p>
<p><br>
CAN.</p>
<p>PRESENT TENSE; AND SIGN OF THE POTENTIAL PRESENT.</p>
<p><i>Sing.</i> I can, thou canst, he can; <i>Plur.</i> We can, you can, they can.</p>
<p>IMPERFECT TENSE; AND SIGN OF THE POTENTIAL IMPERFECT.</p>
<p><i>Sing.</i> I could, thou couldst, he could; <i>Plur.</i> We could, you could, they could.</p>
<p><br>
MUST.</p>
<p>PRESENT TENSE; AND SIGN OF THE POTENTIAL PRESENT.</p>
<p><i>Sing.</i> I must, thou must, he must; <i>Plur.</i> We must, you must, they must.</p>
<p>If must is ever used in the sense of the Imperfect tense, or Preterit, the form is the same as that of the Present: this word is entirely invariable.</p>
<p>OBS. 11.--Several of the auxiliaries are occasionally used as mere expletives, being quite unnecessary to the sense: as, 1. DO and DID: "And it is night, wherein all the beasts of the forest <i>do</i> creep forth."--<i>Psalms</i>, civ, 20. "And ye, that on the sands with printless foot <i>do</i> chase the ebbing Neptune, and <i>do</i> fly him when he comes back."--<i>Shak.</i> "And if a man <i>did</i> need a poison now."--<i>Id.</i> This needless use of do and did is now avoided by good writers. 2. SHALL, SHOULD, and COULD: "'Men <i>shall</i> deal unadvisedly sometimes, which after-hours give leisure to repent of.' I <i>should</i> advise you to proceed. I <i>should</i> think it would succeed. He, it <i>should</i> seem, thinks otherwise."--<i>W. Allen's Gram.</i>, p. 65. "I <i>could</i> wish you to go."--<i>Ib.</i>, p. 71. 3. WILL, &amp;c. The following are nearly of the same character, but not exactly: "The isle is full of noises; sometimes a thousand twanging instruments <i>will</i> hum about mine ears."--<i>Shak.</i> "In their evening sports she <i>would</i> steal in amongst them."--<i>Barbauld</i>.</p>
<pre>  "His listless length at noontide <i>would</i> he stretch."--<i>Gray</i>.
</pre>
<p>OBS. 12.--As our old writers often formed the infinitive in <i>en</i>, so they sometimes dropped the termination of the perfect participle. Hence we find, in the infancy of the language, <i>done</i> used for <i>do</i>, and <i>do</i> for <i>done</i>; and that by the same hand, with like changes in other verbs: as, "Thou canst nothing <i>done</i>."--<i>Chaucer</i>. "As he was wont to <i>done</i>."--<i>Id.</i> "The treson that to women hath be <i>do</i>."--<i>Id.</i> "For to <i>ben</i> honourable and free."--<i>Id.</i> "I am sworn to <i>holden</i> it secre."--<i>Id.</i> "Our nature God hath to him <i>unyte</i>."--<i>Douglas</i>. "None otherwise negligent than I you saie haue I not <i>bee</i>."--<i>Id.</i> See <i>W. Allen's E. Gram.</i>, p. 97.</p>
<pre>  "But netheless the thynge is <i>do</i>,
   That fals god was soone <i>go</i>."--GOWER: <i>H. Tooke</i>, Vol. i, p. 376.
</pre>
<p>OBS. 13.--"<i>May</i> is from the Anglo-Saxon, <i>mægan</i>, to be able. In the parent language also, it is used as an auxiliary. It is exhibited by Fortescue, as a principal verb; 'They shall <i>may</i> do it:' i. e. they shall be able (to) do it."--<i>W. Allen's Gram.</i>, p. 70. "<i>May not</i>, was formerly used for <i>must not</i>; as, 'Graces for which we <i>may not</i> cease to sue.' Hooker."--<i>Ib.</i>, p. 91. "<i>May</i> frequently expresses doubt of the fact; as, 'I <i>may</i> have the book in my library, but I think I have not.' It is used also, to express doubt, or a consequence, with a future signification; as, 'I <i>may</i> recover the use of my limbs, but I see little probability of it.'--'That they <i>may</i> receive me into their houses.' <i>Luke</i>, xvi, 4."--<i>Churchill's Gram.</i>, p. 247. In these latter instances, the potential present is akin to the subjunctive. Hence Lowth and others improperly call "I <i>may love</i>," &amp;c. the subjunctive mood. Others, for the same reason, and with as little propriety, deny that we have any subjunctive mood; alleging an ellipsis in every thing that bears that name: as, "'If it (<i>may</i>) <i>be</i> possible, live peaceably with all men.' Scriptures."--<i>W. Allen's Gram.</i>, p. 61. <i>May</i> is also a sign of wishing, and consequently occurs often in prayer: as, "<i>May</i> it be thy good pleasure;"--"O that it <i>may</i> please thee;"--"<i>Mayst</i> thou be pleased." Hence the potential is akin also to the imperative: the phrases, "Thy will be done,"--"<i>May</i> thy will be done,"--"Be thy will done,"--"<i>Let</i> thy will be done,"--are alike in meaning, but not in mood or construction.</p>
<p>OBS. 14.--<i>Can</i>, to be able, is etymologically the same as the regular verbs <i>ken</i>, to see, and <i>con</i>, to learn; all of them being derived from the Saxon <i>connan</i> or <i>cunnan</i>, to know: whence also the adjective cunning, which was formerly a participle. In the following example <i>will</i> and <i>can</i> are principal verbs: "In evil, the best condition is, not to <i>will</i>; the second, not to <i>can</i>."--<i>Ld. Bacon</i>. "That a verb which signifies knowledge, may also signify power, appears from these examples: <i>Je ne</i> saurois, I should not know how<i>, (i. e.</i> could <i>not.) [Greek: Asphalisasthe</i> hos oidate], Strengthen it as you <i>know how</i>, (i. e. as you <i>can</i>.) <i>Nescio</i> mentiri, I <i>know not how to</i> (i.e. <i>I cannot</i>) lie."--<i>W. Allen's</i> Gram.<i>, p. 71.</i> Shall<i>, Saxon</i> sceal<i>, originally signified to</i> owe<i>; for</i> which reason <i>should</i> literally means <i>ought</i>. In the following example from Chaucer, <i>shall</i> is a principal verb, with its original meaning:</p>
<pre>  "For, by the faith I <i>shall</i> to God, I wene,
   Was neuer straungir none in hir degre."--<i>W. Allen's Gram.</i>, p. 64.
</pre>
<p>OBS. 15.--<i>Do</i> and <i>did</i> are auxiliary only to the present infinitive, or the radical verb; as, <i>do throw, did throw</i>: thus the mood of <i>do throw</i> or <i>to throw</i> is marked by <i>do</i> or <i>to</i>. <i>Be</i>, in all its parts, is auxiliary to either of the simple participles; as, <i>to be throwing, to be thrown; I</i> am throwing, I am thrown<i>: and so, through the whole conjugation.</i> Have and <i>had</i>, in their literal use, are auxiliary to the perfect participle only; as, <i>have thrown, had thrown. Have</i> is from the Saxon <i>habban</i>, to possess; and, from the nature of the perfect participle, the tenses thus formed, suggest in general a completion of the action. The French idiom is similar to this: as, <i>J'ai vu</i>, I have seen. <i>Shall</i> and <i>should, will</i> and <i>would, may</i> and <i>might, can</i> and <i>could, must</i>, and also <i>need, (if we</i> call the last a helping verb,) are severally auxiliary to both forms of the infinitive, and to these only: as, shall throw, shall have thrown; should throw, should have thrown<i>; and so of all the rest.</i></p>
<p>OBS. 16.--The form of the indicative pluperfect is sometimes used in lieu of the potential pluperfect; as, "If all the world could have seen it, the wo <i>had been</i> universal."--<i>Shakspeare</i>. That is,--"<i>would have been</i> universal." "I <i>had been drowned</i>, but that the shore was shelvy and shallow."--<i>Id.</i> That is,--"I <i>should have been drowned</i>." This mode of expression may be referred to the figure <i>enallage</i>, in which one word or one modification is used for an other. Similar to this is the use of <i>were</i> for <i>would be</i>: "It <i>were</i> injustice to deny the execution of the law to any individual;" that is, "it <i>would</i> be injustice."--<i>Murray's Grammar</i>, p. 89. In some instances, <i>were</i> and <i>had been</i> seem to have the same import; as, "Good <i>were</i> it for that man if he had never been born."--<i>Mark</i>, xiv, 21. "It <i>had been</i> good for that man if he had not been born."--<i>Matt.</i>, xxvi, 24. In prose, all these licenses are needless, if not absolutely improper. In poetry, their brevity may commend them to preference; but to this style, I think, they ought to be confined: as,</p>
<pre>  "That <i>had been</i> just, replied the reverend bard;
   But done, fair youth, thou ne'er <i>hadst met</i> me here."--<i>Pollok</i>.
</pre>
<pre>   "The keystones of the arch!--though all were o'er,
   For us repeopled <i>were</i> the solitary shore."--<i>Byron</i>.
</pre>
<p>OBS. 17.--With an adverb of comparison or preference, as <i>better, rather,</i> best, as lief<i>, or</i> as lieve<i>, the auxiliary</i> had <i>seems sometimes to be</i> used before the infinitive to form the potential imperfect or pluperfect: as, "He that loses by getting, <i>had better lose</i> than get."--<i>Penn's</i> Maxims<i>. "Other prepositions</i> had better have been substituted<i>."--</i> <i>Priestley's Gram.</i>, p. 166. "I had as lief say."--LOWTH: <i>ib.</i>, p. 110. "It compels me to think of that which I <i>had rather forget</i>."-- <i>Bickersteth, on Prayer</i>, p. 25. "You <i>had much better say</i> nothing upon the subject."--<i>Webster's Essays</i>, p. 147. "I <i>had much rather show</i> thee what hopes thou hast before thee."--<i>Baxter</i>. "I <i>had rather speak</i> five words with my understanding, than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue."--<i>1 Cor.</i>, xiv, 19. "I knew a gentleman in America who told me <i>how much rather he had be</i> a woman than the man he is."--<i>Martineau's</i> Society in America<i>, Vol. i, p. 153. "I</i> had as lief go <i>as not."--</i> <i>Webster's Dict., w. Lief</i>. "I <i>had as lieve</i> the town crier spoke my lines."--SHAK.: <i>Hamlet</i>. "We <i>had best leave</i> nature to her own operations."--<i>Kames, El. of Crit.</i>, Vol. i, p. 310. "What method <i>had he</i> best take<i>?"--</i>Harris's Hermes<i>, p. ix. These are equivalent to the</i> phrases, <i>might better lose--might</i> better have been substituted--<i>would</i> as lief say--<i>would</i> rather forget--<i>might</i> much better say--<i>would</i> much rather show--<i>would</i> rather speak--how much rather he <i>would</i> be--<i>would</i> as lief go--<i>should</i> best leave--<i>might</i> he best take; and, for the sake of regularity, these latter forms ought to be preferred, as they sometimes are: thus, "For my own part, I <i>would rather look</i> upon a tree in all its luxuriancy."--<i>Addison, Spect.</i>, No. 414; <i>Blair's Rhet.</i>, p. 223. The following construction is different: "Augustus <i>had like to</i> have been slain."--<i>S. Butler</i>. Here <i>had</i> is a principal verb of the indicative imperfect. The following examples appear to be positively erroneous: "Much that was said, <i>had better remained</i> unsaid."--<i>N. Y. Observer</i>. Say, "<i>might better have remained</i>." "A man that is lifting a weight, if he put not sufficient strength to it, <i>had as good</i> put none at all."--<i>Baxter</i>. Say, "<i>might as well put</i>." "You <i>were better pour</i> off the first infusion, and use the latter."--<i>Bacon</i>. Say, "<i>might better pour</i>;" or, if you prefer it, "<i>had better pour.</i>" Shakspeare has an expression which is still worse:--</p>
<pre>  "Or, by the worth of mine eternal soul,
   Thou <i>hadst been better have been born</i> a dog."--<i>Beauties</i>, p. 295.
</pre>
<p>OBS. 18.--The form of conjugating the active verb, is often called the <i>Active Voice</i>, and that of the passive verb, the <i>Passive Voice</i>. These terms are borrowed from the Latin and Greek grammars, and, except as serving to diversify expression, are of little or no use in English grammar. Some grammarians deny that there is any propriety in them, with respect to any language. De Sacy, after showing that the import of the verb does not always follow its form of voice, adds: "We must, therefore, carefully distinguish the Voice of a Verb from its signification. To facilitate the distinction, I denominate that an <i>Active</i> Verb which contains an Attribute in which the action is considered as performed by the Subject; and that a <i>Passive</i> Verb which contains an Attribute in which the action is considered as suffered by the Subject, and performed upon it by some agent. I call that voice a <i>Subjective</i> Voice which is generally appropriated to the Active Verb, and that an <i>Objective</i> Voice which is generally appropriated to the Passive Verb. As to the Neuter Verbs, if they possess a peculiar form, I call it a Neuter Voice."--<i>Fosdick's</i> Translation<i>, p. 99.</i></p>
<p>OBS. 19.--A recognition of the difference between actives and passives, in our original classification of verbs with respect to their signification,-- a principle of division very properly adopted in a great majority of our grammars and dictionaries, but opinionately rejected by Webster, Bolles, and sundry late grammarians,--renders it unnecessary, if not improper, to place Voices, the Active Voice and the Passive, among the <i>modifications</i> of our verbs, or to speak of them as such in the conjugations. So must it be in respect to "a Neuter Voice," or any other distinction which the classification involves. The significant characteristic is not overlooked; the distinction is not neglected as nonessential; but it is transferred to a different category. Hence I cannot exactly approve of the following remark, which "the Rev. W. Allen" appears to cite with approbation: "'The distinction of active or passive,' says the accurate Mr. Jones, <b>is not</b> essential <i>to verbs. In the infancy of language, it was, in all</i> probability, not known. In Hebrew, the difference but imperfectly exists, and, in the early periods of it, probably did not exist at all. In Arabic, the only distinction which obtains, arises from the vowel points, a late invention compared with the antiquity of that language. And in our own tongue, the names of <i>active</i> and <i>passive</i> would have remained unknown, if they had not been learnt in Latin.'"--<i>Allen's Elements of English Gram.</i>, p. 96.</p>
<p>OBS. 20.--By <i>the conjugation</i> of a verb, some teachers choose to understand nothing more than the naming of its principal parts; giving to the arrangement of its numbers and persons, through all the moods and tenses, the name of <i>declension.</i> This is a misapplication of terms, and the distinction is as needless, as it is contrary to general usage. Dr. Bullions, long silent concerning principal parts, seems now to make a singular distinction between "<i>conjugating</i>" and "<i>conjugation.</i>" His <i>conjugations</i> include the moods, tenses, and inflections of verbs; but he teaches also, with some inaccuracy, as follows: "The principal parts of the verb are the <i>Present indicative</i>, the <i>Past indicative</i> and the <i>Past</i> participle. <i>The mentioning of these parts is called CONJUGATING THE</i> VERB."--<i>Analyt. and Pract. Gram.</i>, 1849, p. 80.</p>
<p>OBS. 21.--English verbs having but very few inflections to indicate to what part of the scheme of moods and tenses they pertain, it is found convenient to insert in our conjugations the preposition <i>to</i>, to mark the infinitive; personal <i>pronouns</i>, to distinguish the persons and numbers; the conjunction <i>if</i>, to denote the subjunctive mood; and the adverb <i>not</i>, to show the form of negation. With these additions, or indexes, a verb may be conjugated in <i>four ways</i>:--</p>
<p>1. Affirmatively; as, I write, I do write, or, I am writing; and so on.</p>
<p>2. Negatively; as, I write not, I do not write, or, I am not writing.</p>
<p>3. Interrogatively; as, Write I? Do I write? or, Am I writing?</p>
<p>4. Interrogatively and negatively; as, Write I not? Do I not write? or, Am I not writing?</p>
<p>1. SIMPLE FORM, ACTIVE OR NEUTER.</p>
<p>The simplest form of an English conjugation, is that which makes the present and imperfect tenses without auxiliaries; but, even in these, auxiliaries are required for the potential mood, and are often preferred for the indicative.</p>
<p>FIRST EXAMPLE.</p>
<p><i>The regular active verb LOVE, conjugated affirmatively</i>.</p>
<p>PRINCIPAL PARTS.</p>
<p><i>Present. Preterit. Imperfect Participle. Perfect Participle.</i></p>
<pre>   Love.     Loved.          Loving.                Loved.
</pre>
<p><br>
INFINITIVE MOOD.[260]</p>
<p>The infinitive mood is that form of the verb, which expresses the being, action, or passion, in an unlimited manner, and without person or number. It is used only in the present and perfect tenses.</p>
<p>PRESENT TENSE.</p>
<p>This tense is the <i>root</i>, or <i>radical verb</i>; and is usually preceded by the preposition <i>to</i>, which shows its relation to some other word: thus,</p>
<p>To love.</p>
<p>PERFECT TENSE.</p>
<p>This tense prefixes the auxiliary <i>have</i> to the perfect participle; and, like the infinitive present, is usually preceded by the preposition <i>to</i>: thus,</p>
<p>To have loved.</p>
<p>INDICATIVE MOOD.</p>
<p>The indicative mood is that form of the verb, which simply indicates or declares a thing, or asks a question. It is used in all the tenses.</p>
<p>PRESENT TENSE.</p>
<p>The present indicative, in its simple form, is essentially the same as the present infinitive, or radical verb; except that the verb <i>be</i> has <i>am</i> in the indicative.</p>
<p>1. The simple form of the present tense is varied thus:--</p>
<pre> <i>Singular</i>.         <i>Plural</i>.
</pre>
<p>1st person, I love, 1st person. We love, 2d person, Thou lovest, 2d person, You love, 3d person, He loves; 3d person, They love.</p>
<p>2. This tense may also be formed by prefixing the auxiliary <i>do</i> to the verb: thus,</p>
<pre> <i>Singular</i>.        <i>Plural</i>.
</pre>
<p>1. I do love, 1. We do love, 2. Thou dost love, 2. You do love, 3. He does love; 3. They do love.</p>
<p>IMPERFECT TENSE.</p>
<p>This tense, in its simple form is <i>the preterit</i>; which, in all regular verbs, adds <i>d</i> or <i>ed</i> to the present, but in others is formed variously.</p>
<p>1. The simple form of the imperfect tense is varied thus:--</p>
<pre>   <i>Singular</i>.   <i>Plural</i>.
</pre>
<p>1. I loved, 1. We loved, 2. Thou lovedst, 2. You loved, 3. He loved; 3. They loved.</p>
<p>2. This tense may also be formed by prefixing the auxiliary <i>did</i> to the present: thus,</p>
<pre>   <i>Singular</i>.   <i>Plural</i>.
</pre>
<p>1. I did love, 1. We did love, 2. Thou didst love, 2. You did love, 3. He did love; 3. They did love.</p>
<p>PERFECT TENSE.</p>
<p>This tense prefixes the auxiliary <i>have</i> to the perfect participle: thus,</p>
<pre>   <i>Singular</i>.     <i>Plural</i>.
</pre>
<p>1. I have loved, 1. We have loved, 2. Thou hast loved, 2. You have loved, 3. He has loved; 3. They have loved.</p>
<p>IMPERFECT TENSE.</p>
<p>This tense prefixes the auxiliary <i>had</i> to the perfect participle: thus,</p>
<pre>   <i>Singular</i>.       <i>Plural</i>.
</pre>
<p>1. I had loved, 1. We had loved, 2. Thou hadst loved, 2. You had loved, 3. He had loved; 3. They had loved.</p>
<p>FIRST-FUTURE TENSE.</p>
<p>This tense prefixes the auxiliary <i>shall</i> or <i>will</i> to the present: thus,</p>
<p>1. Simply to express a future action or event:--</p>
<pre>   <i>Singular</i>.        <i>Plural</i>.
</pre>
<p>1. I shall love, 1. We shall love, 2. Thou wilt love, 2. You will love, 3. He will love; 3. They will love;</p>
<p>2. To express a promise, volition, command, or threat:--</p>
<pre>   <i>Singular</i>.      <i>Plural</i>.
</pre>
<p>1. I will love, 1. We will love, 2. Thou shalt love, 2. You shall love, 3. He shall love; 3. They shall love.</p>
<p>SECOND-FUTURE TENSE.</p>
<p>This tense prefixes the auxiliaries <i>shall have</i> or <i>will have</i> to the perfect participle: thus,</p>
<pre>  <i>Singular</i>.          <i>Plural</i>.
</pre>
<p>1. I shall have loved, 1. We shall have loved, 2. Thou wilt have loved, 2. You will have loved, 3. He will have loved; 3. They will have loved.</p>
<p>OBS.--The auxiliary <i>shall</i> may also be used in the second and third persons of this tense, when preceded by a conjunction expressing condition or contingency; as, "<i>If</i> he <i>shall have completed</i> the work by midsummer."--<i>L. Murray's Gram.</i>, p. 80. So, with the conjunctive adverb <i>when</i>; as, "Then cometh the end, <i>when</i> he <i>shall have delivered</i> up the kingdom to God, even the Father; <i>when</i> he <i>shall have put</i> down all rule and all authority and power."--<i>1 Cor.</i>, xv, 24. And perhaps <i>will</i> may here be used in the first person to express a promise, though such usage, I think, seldom occurs. Professor Fowler has given to this tense, first, the "<i>Predictive</i>" form, as exhibited above, and then a form which he calls "<i>Promissive</i>," and in which the auxiliaries are varied thus: "Singular. 1. I <i>will</i> have taken. 2. Thou <i>shalt</i> have taken, you <i>shall</i> have taken. 3. He <i>shall</i> have taken. Plural. 1. We <i>will</i> have taken. 2. Ye <i>or</i> you <i>shall</i> have taken. 3. He [say <i>They</i>,] <i>shall</i> have taken."--<i>Fowler's E.</i> Gram.<i>, 8vo., N. Y., 1850, p. 281. But the other instances just cited show</i> that such a form is not always promissory.</p>
<p><br>
POTENTIAL MOOD.</p>
<p>The potential mood is that form of the verb, which expresses the power, liberty, possibility, or necessity of the being, action, or passion. It is used in the first four tenses; but the potential <i>imperfect</i> is properly an <i>aorist</i>: its time is very indeterminate; as, "He <i>would be</i> devoid of sensibility were he not greatly satisfied."--<i>Lord Kames, El. of Crit.</i>, Vol. i, p. 11.</p>
<p><br>
PRESENT TENSE.</p>
<p>This tense prefixes the auxiliary <i>may, can</i>, or <i>must</i>, to the radical verb: thus,</p>
<pre>   <i>Singular</i>.                <i>Plural</i>.
</pre>
<p>1. I may love, 1. We may love, 2. Thou mayst love, 2. You may love, 3. He may love; 3. They may love.</p>
<p><br>
IMPERFECT TENSE.</p>
<p>This tense prefixes the auxiliary <i>might, could, would</i>, or <i>should</i>, to the radical verb: thus,</p>
<pre>   <i>Singular</i>.                <i>Plural</i>.
</pre>
<p>1. I might love, 1. We might love, 2. Thou mightst love, 2. You might love, 3. He might love; 3. They might love.</p>
<p><br>
PERFECT TENSE.</p>
<p>This tense prefixes the auxiliaries, <i>may have, can have</i>, or <i>must have</i>, to the perfect participle: thus,</p>
<pre>   <i>Singular</i>.                <i>Plural</i>.
</pre>
<p>1. I may have loved, 1. We may have loved, 2. Thou mayst have loved, 2. You may have loved, 3. He may have loved; 3. They may have loved.</p>
<p><br>
PLUPERFECT TENSE.</p>
<p>This tense prefixes the auxiliaries, <i>might have, could have, would have</i>, or <i>should have</i>, to the perfect participle: thus,</p>
<pre>   <i>Singular</i>.               <i>Plural</i>.
</pre>
<p>1. I might have loved, 1. We might have loved, 2. Thou mightst have loved, 2. You might have loved, 3. He might have loved; 3. They might have loved.</p>
<p><br>
SUBJUNCTIVE MOOD.</p>
<p>The subjunctive mood is that form of the verb, which represents the being, action, or passion, as conditional, doubtful, or contingent. This mood is generally preceded by a conjunction; as, <i>if, that, though, lest, unless,</i> except<i>. But sometimes, especially in poetry, it is formed by a mere</i> placing of the verb before the nominative; as, "<i>Were I</i>," for, "<i>If I</i> were<i>;"--"</i>Had he<i>," for, "</i>If he had<i>;"--"</i>Fall we<i>" for, "</i>If we fall<i>;"--"</i>Knew they<i>," for, "</i>If they knew<i>." It does not vary its</i> termination at all, in the different persons.[261] It is used in the present, and sometimes in the imperfect tense; rarely--and perhaps never <i>properly</i>--in any other. As this mood can be used only in a dependent clause, the <i>time</i> implied in its tenses is always relative, and generally indefinite; as,</p>
<pre>  "It shall be in eternal restless change,
   Self-fed, and self-consum'd: <i>if this fail</i>,
   The pillar'd firmament is rottenness."--<i>Milton, Comus</i>, l. 596.
</pre>
<p>PRESENT TENSE.</p>
<p>This tense is generally used to express some condition on which a future action or event is affirmed. It is therefore erroneously considered by some grammarians, as an elliptical form of the future.</p>
<p><i>Singular</i>. <i>Plural</i>. 1. If I love, 1. If we love, 2. If Thou love, 2. If you love, 3. If He love; 3. If they love.</p>
<p>OBS.--In this tense, the auxiliary <i>do</i> is sometimes employed; as, "If thou <i>do prosper</i> my way."--<i>Genesis</i>, xxiv, 42. "If he <i>do</i> not <i>utter</i> it."--<i>Leviticus</i>, v, 1. "If he <i>do</i> but <i>intimate</i> his desire."--<i>Murray's</i> Key<i>, p. 207. "If he</i> do promise<i>, he will certainly perform."--</i>Ib.<i>, p.</i> 208. "An event which, if it ever <i>do occur</i>, must occur in some future period."--<i>Hiley's Gram.</i>, (3d Ed., Lond.,) p. 89. "If he <i>do</i> but <i>promise</i>, thou art safe."--<i>Ib.</i>, 89.</p>
<pre>  "Till old experience <i>do attain</i>
   To something like prophetic strain."--MILTON: <i>Il Penseroso</i>.
</pre>
<p>These examples, if they are right, prove the tense to be <i>present</i>, and not <i>future</i>, as Hiley and some others suppose it to be.</p>
<p>IMPERFECT TENSE.</p>
<p>This tense, like the imperfect of the potential mood, with which it is frequently connected, is properly an aorist, or indefinite tense; for it may refer to time past, present, or future: as, "If therefore perfection <i>were</i> by the Levitical priesthood, what further need <i>was</i> there that an other priest <i>should rise</i>?"--<i>Heb.</i>, vii, 11. "They must be viewed <i>exactly</i> in the same light, as if the intention to purchase <i>now</i> existed<i>."--</i>Murray's Parsing Exercises<i>, p. 24. "If it</i> were <i>possible,</i> they <i>shall deceive</i> the very elect."--<i>Matt.</i>, xxiv, 24. "If the whole body <i>were</i> an eye, where <i>were</i> the hearing?"--<i>1 Corinthians</i>, xii, 17. "If the thankful <i>refrained</i>, it <i>would be</i> pain and grief to them."--<i>Atterbury</i>.</p>
<p><i>Singular</i>. <i>Plural</i>. 1. If I loved, 1. If we loved, 2. If thou loved, 2. If you loved, 3. If he loved; 3. If they loved.</p>
<p>OBS.--In this tense, the auxiliary <i>did</i> is sometimes employed. The subjunctive may here be distinguished from the indicative, by these circumstances; namely, that the time is indefinite, and that the supposition is always contrary to the fact: as, "Great is the number of those who might attain to true wisdom, if they <i>did not already think</i> themselves wise."--<i>Dillwyn's Reflections</i>, p. 36. This implies that they <i>do think</i> themselves wise; but an indicative supposition or concession--(as, "Though they <i>did not think</i> themselves wise, they were so--") accords with the fact, and with the literal time of the tense,--here time past. The subjunctive imperfect, suggesting the idea of what is not, and known by the sense, is sometimes introduced without any of the <i>usual</i> signs<i>; as, "In a society of perfect men,</i> where all understood <i>what was</i> morally right, and <i>were determined</i> to act accordingly, it is obvious, that human laws, or even human organization to enforce God's laws, would be altogether unnecessary, and could serve no valuable purpose."--PRES. SHANNON: <i>Examiner</i>, No. 78.</p>
<p>IMPERATIVE MOOD.</p>
<p>The imperative mood is that form of the verb, which is used in commanding, exhorting, entreating, or permitting. It is commonly used only in the second person of the present tense.</p>
<p>PRESENT TENSE.</p>
<p><i>Singular.</i> 2. Love [thou,] <i>or</i> Do thou love;</p>
<p><i>Plural.</i> 2. Love [ye <i>or</i> you,] <i>or</i> Do you love.</p>
<p>OBS.--In the Greek language, which has three numbers, the imperative mood is used in the second and third persons of them all; and has also several different tenses, some of which cannot be clearly rendered in English. In Latin, this mood has a distinct form for the third person, both singular and plural. In Italian, Spanish, and French, the first person plural is also given it. Imitations of some of these forms are occasionally employed in English, particularly by the poets. Such imitations must be referred to this mood, unless by ellipsis and transposition we make them out to be something else; and against this there are strong objections. Again, as imprecation on one's self is not impossible, the first person singular may be added; so that this mood <i>may possibly have</i> all the persons and numbers. Examples: "<i>Come we</i> now to his translation of the Iliad."--<i>Pope's Pref. to Dunciad</i>. "<i>Proceed we</i> therefore in our subject."--<i>Ib.</i> "<i>Blessed be he</i> that blesseth thee."--<i>Gen.</i>, xxvii, 29. "Thy <i>kingdom come</i>."--<i>Matt.</i>, vi, 10. "But <i>pass we</i> that."--<i>W. Scott</i>. "Third person: <i>Be he, Be they</i>."--<i>Churchill's Gram.</i>, p. 92.</p>

<p>NOTES.</p>
<p>NOTE I--The student ought to be able to rehearse the form of a verb, not only according to the order of the entire conjugation, but also according to the synopsis of the several persons and numbers. One sixth part of the paradigm, thus recited, gives in general a fair sample of the whole: and, in class recitations, this mode of rehearsal will save much time: as, IND. I see <i>or</i> do see, I saw <i>or</i> did see, I have seen, I had seen, I shall <i>or</i> will see, I shall <i>or</i> will have seen. POT. I may, can, <i>or</i> must see; I might, could, would, <i>or</i> should see; I may, can, <i>or</i> must have seen; I might, could, would, <i>or</i> should have seen. SUBJ. If I see, If I saw.</p>
<p>NOTE II.--In the familiar style, the second person singular of this verb is usually and more properly formed thus: IND.

<p><br>
OBSERVATIONS.</p>
<p>OBS. 1.--It appears that <i>be</i>, as well as <i>am</i>, was formerly used for the indicative present: as, "I be, Thou beest, He be; We be, Ye be, They be." See <i>Brightland's Gram.</i>, p. 114. Dr. Lowth, whose Grammar is still preferred at Harvard University, gives both forms, thus: "I am, Thou art, He is; We are, Ye are, They are. Or, I be, Thou beest, He <i>is</i>; We be, Ye be, They be." To the third person singular, he subjoins the following example and remark: "'I think it <i>be</i> thine indeed, for thou liest in it.' Shak. Hamlet. <i>Be</i>, in the singular number of this time and mode, especially in the third person, is obsolete; and <i>is become</i> somewhat antiquated <i>in the plural</i>."--<i>Lowth's Gram.</i>, p. 36. Dr. Johnson gives this tense thus: "<i>Sing</i>. I am; thou art; he is; <i>Plur</i>. We are, <i>or</i> be; ye are, <i>or</i> be; they are, <i>or</i> be." And adds, "The plural <i>be</i> is now little in use."--<i>Gram. in Johnson's Dict.</i>, p. 8. The Bible commonly has <i>am, art, is</i>, and <i>are</i>, but not always; the indicative <i>be</i> occurs in some places: as, "We <i>be</i> twelve brethren."--<i>Gen.</i>, xlii, 32. "What <i>be</i> these two olive branches?"--<i>Zech.</i>, iv, 12. Some traces of this usage still occur in poetry: as,</p>
<pre>  "There <i>be</i> more things to greet the heart and eyes
   In Arno's dome of Art's most princely shrine,
   Where Sculpture with her rainbow sister vies;
   There <i>be</i> more marvels yet--but not for mine."
       --<i>Byron's Childe Harold</i>, Canto iv, st. 61.
</pre>
<p>OBS. 2.--Respecting the verb <i>wert</i>, it is not easy to determine whether it is most properly of the indicative mood only, or of the subjunctive mood only, or of both, or of neither. The <i>regular</i> and <i>analogical</i> form for the indicative, is "Thou <i>wast</i>;" and for the subjunctive, "If thou <i>were</i>." Brightland exhibits, "I <i>was</i> or <i>were</i>, Thou <i>wast</i> or <i>wert</i>, He <i>was</i> or <i>were</i>," without distinction of mood, for the three persons singular; and, for the plural, <i>were</i> only. Dr. Johnson gives us, for the indicative, "Thou wast, <i>or</i> wert;" with the remark, "<i>Wert</i> is properly of the <i>conjunctive</i> mood, and ought not to be used in the indicative."--<i>Johnson's Gram.</i>, p. 8. In his conjunctive (or subjunctive) mood, he has, "Thou <i>beest</i>," and "Thou <i>wert</i>." So Milton wrote, "If thou <i>beest</i> he."--<i>P. Lost</i>, B. i, l. 84. Likewise Shakspeare: "If thou <i>beest</i> Stephano."--<i>Tempest</i>. This inflection of <i>be</i> is obsolete: all now say, "If thou <i>be</i>." But <i>wert</i> is still in use, to some extent, <i>for both</i> moods<i>; being generally placed by the grammarians in the subjunctive only,</i> but much oftener written for the indicative: as, "Whate'er thou art or <i>wert</i>."--<i>Byron's Harold</i>, Canto iv, st. 115. "O thou that <i>wert</i> so happy!"--<i>Ib.</i>, st. 109. "Vainly <i>wert</i> thou wed."--<i>Ib.</i>, st. 169.</p>
<p>OBS. 3.--Dr. Lowth gave to this verb, BE, that form of the subjunctive mood, which it now has in most of our grammars; appending to it the following examples and questions: "'Before the sun, Before the Heavens, thou <i>wert</i>.'--<i>Milton</i>. 'Remember what thou <i>wert</i>.'--<i>Dryden</i>. 'I knew thou <i>wert</i> not slow to hear.'--<i>Addison</i>. 'Thou who of old <i>wert</i> sent to Israel's court.'--<i>Prior</i>. 'All this thou <i>wert</i>.'--<i>Pope</i>. 'Thou, Stella, <i>wert</i> no longer young.'--<i>Swift</i>. Shall we, in deference to these great authorities," asks the Doctor, "allow <i>wert</i> to be the same with <i>wast</i>, and common to the indicative and [the] subjunctive mood? or rather abide by the practice of our best ancient writers; the propriety of the language, which requires, as far as may be, distinct forms, for different moods; and the analogy of formation in each mood; I <i>was</i>, thou <i>wast</i>; I <i>were</i>, thou <i>wert</i>? all which conspire to make <i>wert</i> peculiar to the subjunctive mood."--<i>Lowth's Gram.</i>, p. 37; <i>Churchill's</i>, p. 251. I have before shown, that several of the "best ancient writers" <i>did not inflect</i> the verb <i>were</i>, but wrote "<i>thou were</i>;" and, surely, "the analogy of formation," requires that the subjunctive <i>be not inflected</i>. Hence "the propriety which requires distinct forms," requires not <i>wert</i>, in either mood. Why then should we make this contraction of the old indicative form <i>werest</i>, a <i>solitary exception</i>, by fixing it in the subjunctive only, and that in opposition to the best authorities that ever used it? It is worthier to take rank with its kindred <i>beest</i>, and be called an <i>archaism</i>.</p>
<p>OBS. 4.--The chief characteristical difference between the indicative and the subjunctive mood, is, that in the latter the verb is <i>not inflected at</i> all<i>, in the different persons: IND. "Thou</i> magnifiest <i>his work." SUBJ.</i> "Remember that thou <i>magnify</i> his work."--<i>Job</i>, xxxvi, 24. IND. "He <i>cuts</i> off, <i>shuts</i> up, and <i>gathers</i> together." SUBJ. "If he <i>cut</i> off, and <i>shut</i> up, or <i>gather</i> together, then who can hinder him?"--<i>Job</i>, xl, 10. There is also a difference of meaning. The Indicative, "If he <i>was</i>," admits the fact; the Subjunctive, "If he <i>were</i>," supposes that he was not. These moods may therefore be distinguished by the sense, even when their forms are alike: as, "Though <i>it thundered</i>, it did not rain."--"Though <i>it thundered</i>, he would not hear it." The indicative assumption here is, "Though it <i>did thunder</i>," or, "Though there <i>was</i> thunder<i>;" the subjunctive, "Though it</i> should thunder<i>," or, "Though there</i> <i>were</i> thunder." These senses are clearly different. Writers however are continually confounding these moods; some in one way, some in an other. Thus S. R. Hall, the teacher of a <i>Seminary for Teachers</i>: "SUBJ. <i>Present</i> Tense<i>. 1. If I be,</i> or <i>am, 2. If thou be,</i> or <i>art, 3. If he be,</i> or <i>is;</i> 1. If we be, <i>or</i> are, 2. If ye <i>or</i> you be, <i>or</i> are, 3. If they be, <i>or</i> are. <i>Imperfect Tense</i>. 1. If I were, <i>or</i> was, 2. If thou wert, <i>or</i> wast, 3. If he were, <i>or</i> was; 1. If we were, 2. If ye <i>or</i> you were, 3. If they were."--<i>Hall's Grammatical Assistant</i>, p. 11. Again: "SUBJ. <i>Present</i> Tense<i>. 1. If I love, 2. If thou</i> lovest<i>, 3. If he love," &amp;c. "The</i> remaining tenses of this <i>mode</i>, are, <i>in general</i>, similar to the correspondent tenses of the Indicative <i>mode, only</i> with the conjunction prefixed."--<i>Ib.</i>, p. 20. Dr. Johnson observes, "The indicative and conjunctive moods are by modern writers frequently confounded; or rather the conjunctive is wholly neglected, when some convenience of versification does not invite its revival. It is used among the purer writers of former times; as, 'Doubtless thou art our father, though Abraham <i>be</i> ignorant of us, and Israel <i>acknowledge</i> us not.'"--<i>Gram. in Joh. Dict.</i>, p. 9. To neglect the subjunctive mood, or to confound it with the indicative, is to augment several of the worst faults of the language.</p>

II. COMPOUND OR PROGRESSIVE FORM.</p>
<p>Active and neuter verbs may also be conjugated, by adding the Imperfect Participle to the auxiliary verb BE, through all its changes; as, "I <i>am</i> writing <i>a letter."--"He</i> is sitting <i>idle."--"They</i> are going<i>." This form</i> of the verb denotes a <i>continuance</i> of the action or state of being, and is, on many occasions, preferable to the simple form of the verb.</p>

<p>NOTE.--In the familiar style, the second person singular of this verb, is usually and more properly formed thus: IND. Thou art reading, Thou was reading, Thou hast been reading, Thou had been reading, Thou shall <i>or</i> will be reading, Thou shall <i>or</i> will have been reading. POT. Thou may, can, <i>or</i> must be reading; Thou might, could, would, <i>or</i> should be reading; Thou may, can, <i>or</i> must have been reading; Thou might, could, would, <i>or</i> should have been reading. SUBJ. If thou be reading, If thou were reading. IMP. Be [thou,] reading, <i>or</i> Do thou be reading.</p>

OBSERVATIONS.</p>
<p>OBS. 1.--Those verbs which, in their simple form, imply continuance, do not admit the compound form: thus we say, "I <i>respect</i> him;" but not, "I <i>am</i> respecting <i>him." This compound form seems to imply that kind of action,</i> which is susceptible of intermissions and renewals. Affections of the mind or heart are supposed to last; or, rather, actions of this kind are complete as soon as they exist. Hence, <i>to love, to hate, to desire, to</i> fear, to forget, to remember<i>, and many other such verbs, are</i> incapable of this method of conjugation.[265] It is true, we often find in grammars such models, as, "I <i>was loving</i>, Thou <i>wast loving</i>, He <i>was loving</i>," &amp;c. But this language, to express what the authors intend by it, is not English. "He <i>was loving</i>," can only mean, "He was <i>affectionate</i>:" in which sense, loving is an adjective, and susceptible of comparison. Who, in common parlance, has ever said, "He <i>was loving me</i>," or any thing like it? Yet some have improperly published various examples, or even whole conjugations, of this spurious sort. See such in <i>Adam's Gram.</i>, p. 91; <i>Gould's Adam</i>, 83; <i>Bullions's English Gram.</i>, 52; <i>his Analyt. and Pract.</i> Gram.<i>, 92;</i> Chandler's New Gram.<i>, 85 and 86;</i> Clark's<i>, 80;</i> Cooper's Plain and Practical<i>, 70;</i> Frazee's Improved<i>, 66 and 69;</i> S.

Expressions of this kind are condemned by some critics, under the notion that the participle in <i>ing</i> must never be passive; but the usage is unquestionably of far better authority, and, according to my apprehension, in far better taste, than the more complex phraseology which some late writers adopt in its stead; as, "The books <i>are</i> now <i>being sold</i>."--"In all the towns about Cork, the whiskey shops <i>are being closed</i>, and soup, coffee, and tea houses [are] <i>establishing</i> generally."--<i>Dublin Evening</i> Post<i>, 1840.</i></p>
<p>OBS. 3.--The question here is, Which is the most correct expression, "While the bridge <i>was building</i>,"--"While the bridge was <i>a</i> building,"--or, "While the bridge <i>was being built</i>?" And again, Are they all wrong? If none of these is right, we must reject them all, and say, "While <i>they were</i> building <i>the bridge;"--"While the bridge</i> was in process of erection<i>;"--or resort to some other equivalent phrase. Dr. Johnson, after</i> noticing the compound form of active-intransitives, as, "I <i>am</i> going<i>"--"She</i> is dying<i>,"--"The tempest</i> is raging<i>,"--"I</i> have been walking<i>," and so forth, adds: "There is another manner of using the active</i> participle, which gives it a <i>passive</i> signification:[266] as, The grammar is now printing, <i>Grammatica jam nunc chartis imprimitur</i>. The brass is forging, <i>Æra excuduntur</i>. This is, in my opinion," says he, "a <i>vitious</i> expression, probably corrupted from a phrase more pure, but now somewhat obsolete: The book is <i>a</i> printing, The brass is <i>a</i> forging; <i>a</i> being properly <i>at</i>, and <i>printing</i> and <i>forging</i> verbal nouns signifying action, according to the analogy of this language."--<i>Gram. in Joh. Dict.</i>, p. 9.</p>
<p>OBS. 4.--<i>A</i> is certainly sometimes a <i>preposition</i>; and, as such, it may govern a participle, and that without converting it into a "<i>verbal noun</i>." But that such phraseology ought to be preferred to what is exhibited with so many authorities, in a preceding paragraph, and with an example from Johnson among the rest, I am not prepared to concede. As to the notion of introducing a new and more complex passive form of conjugation, as, "The bridge is <i>being built</i>," "The bridge <i>was being built</i>," and so forth, it is one of the most absurd and monstrous innovations ever thought of. Yet some two or three men, who seem to delight in huge absurdities, declare that this "modern <i>innovation</i> is <i>likely to supersede</i>" the simpler mode of expression. Thus, in stead of, "The work <i>is now publishing</i>," they choose to say, "The work is <i>now being published</i>."--<i>Kirkham's Gram.</i>, p. 82. This is certainly no better English than, "The work <i>was being</i> published, has been being published, had been being published, shall or will be being published, shall or will have been being published<i>;" and so</i> on, through all the moods and tenses. What a language shall we have when our verbs are thus conjugated!</p>
<p>OBS. 5.--A certain <i>Irish</i> critic, who even outdoes in rashness the above-cited American, having recently arrived in New York, has republished a grammar, in which he not only repudiates the passive use of the participle in <i>ing</i>, but denies the usual passive form of the present tense, "<i>I am loved, I am smitten</i>" &amp;c., as taught by Murray and others, to be good English; and tells us that the true form is, "<i>I am being loved, I</i> am being smitten<i>," &amp;c. See the 98th and 103d pages of</i> Joseph W. Wright's Philosophical Grammar<i>, (</i>Edition of <i>1838,)</i> dedicated <i>"TO COMMON</i> SENSE!" [267] But both are offset, if not refuted, by the following observations from a source decidedly better: "It has lately become common to use the present participle passive [,] to express the suffering of an action as <i>continuing</i>, instead of the participle in <i>-ing</i> in the passive sense; thus, instead of, 'The house <i>is building</i>,' we now very frequently hear, 'The house <i>is being built</i>.' This mode of expression, besides being awkward, is incorrect, and <i>does not express the idea intended</i>. This will be obvious, I think, from the following considerations.</p>
<p>"1. The expression, <b>is being<i>,' is equivalent to</i></b> <i>is</i>,' and expresses no more; just as, <b>is loving<i>,' is equivalent to,</i></b> <i>loves</i>.' Hence, <b>is</b> being built<i>,' is precisely equivalent to, <b>is built</b></i><b>.'</b></p>
<p>"2. '<i>Built</i>,' is a perfect participle; and therefore cannot, in any connexion, express an action, or the suffering of an action, <i>now in</i> progress<i>. The verb</i> to be<i>, signifies</i> to exist<i>; <b>being</b></i><b>,' therefore, is</b> equivalent to '<i>existing</i>.' If then we substitute the synonyme, the nature of the expression will be obvious; thus, 'the house is <i>being built</i>,' is, in other words, 'the house is <i>existing built</i>,' or more simply as before, 'the house <i>is built</i>;' plainly importing an action not progressing, but now <i>existing in a finished state</i>.</p>
<p>"3. If the expression, '<i>is being built</i>,' be a correct form of the present indicative passive, then it must be equally correct to say in the perfect, <b>has been being built<i>;' in the past perfect,</i></b> <i>had been being built</i>;' in the present infinitive,'<i>to be being built</i>;' in the perfect infinitive,'<i>to have been being built</i>;' and in the present participle, '<i>being being built</i>;' which all will admit to be expressions as incorrect as they are inelegant, but precisely analogous to that which now begins to prevail."--<i>Bullions's Principles of English Gram.</i>, p. 58.</p>
<p>OBS. 6.--It may be replied, that the verbs <i>to be</i> and <i>to exist</i> are not always synonymous; because the former is often a mere auxiliary, or a mere copula, whereas the latter always means something positive, as <i>to be in</i> being, to be extant<i>. Thus we may speak of a thing as</i> being destroyed<i>, or</i> may say, it <i>is annihilated</i>; but we can by no means speak of it as <i>existing destroyed</i>, or say, it <i>exists annihilated</i>. The first argument above is also nugatory. These drawbacks, however, do not wholly destroy the force of the foregoing criticism, or at all extenuate the obvious tautology and impropriety of such phrases as, <i>is being, was being</i>, &amp;c. The gentlemen who affirm that this new form of conjugation "<i>is being</i> introduced <i>into the language," (since they allow participles to follow</i> possessive pronouns) may very fairly be asked, "What evidence have you of <i>its being being introduced</i>?" Nor can they, on their own principles, either object to the monstrous phraseology of this question, or tell how to better it![268]</p>
<p>OBS. 7.--D. H. Sanborn, an other recent writer, has very emphatically censured this innovation, as follows: "English and American writers have of late introduced a new kind of phraseology, which has become quite prevalent in the periodical and popular publications of the day. Their intention, doubtless, is, to supersede the use of the verb in the <i>definite form</i>, when it has a passive signification. They say, 'The ship is <i>being</i> built,'--'time is <i>being wasted</i>,"--'the work is <i>being advanced</i>,' instead of, 'the ship is <i>building</i>, time is <i>wasting</i>, the work is <i>advancing</i>.' Such a phraseology is a solecism too palpable to receive any favor; it is at war with the practice of the most distinguished writers in the English language, such as Dr. Johnson and Addison. "When an individual says, 'a house is being burned,' he declares that a house is <i>existing, burned</i>, which is impossible; for <i>being</i> means existing, and <i>burned, consumed by</i> fire<i>. The house ceases to exist as such, after it is consumed by fire. But</i> when he says, 'a house <i>is burning</i>,' we understand that it is <i>consuming</i> by fire<i>; instead of inaccuracy, doubt, and ambiguity, we have a form of</i> expression perfectly intelligible, beautiful, definite, and appropriate."--<i>Sanborn's Analytical Gram.</i>, p. 102.</p>
<p>OBS. 8.--Dr. Perley speaks of this usage thus: "An attempt has been made of late to introduce a kind of passive participial voice; as, 'The temple is being built.' This ought not to be encouraged. For, besides being an innovation, it is less convenient than the use of the present participle in the passive sense. <i>Being built</i> signifies action <i>finished</i>; and how can, <i>Is being built</i>, signify an <i>action unfinished?"--Perley's Gram.</i>, p. 37.</p>
<p>OBS. 9.--The question now before us has drawn forth, on either side, a deal of ill scholarship and false logic, of which it would be tedious to give even a synopsis. Concerning the import of some of our most common words and phrases, these ingenious masters,--Bullions, Sanborn, and Perley,--severally assert some things which seem not to be exactly true. It is remarkable that critics can err in expounding terms so central to the language, and so familiar to all ears, as "<i>be, being, being built, burned,</i> being burned, is, is burned, to be burned<i>," and the like.</i> That to be <i>and</i> <i>to exist</i>, or their like derivatives, such as <i>being</i> and <i>existing, is</i> and <i>exists</i>, cannot always explain each other, is sufficiently shown above; and thereby is refuted Sanborn's chief argument, that, "<i>is being</i> burned<i>," involves the contradiction of "</i>existing, burned<i>," or "</i>consumed by fire<i>." According to his reasoning, as well as that of Bullions,</i> is burned <i>must mean</i> exists consumed; was burned, existed consumed<i>; and thus</i> our whole passive conjugation would often be found made up of bald absurdities! That this new <i>unco-passive</i> form conflicts with the older and better usage of taking the progressive form sometimes passively, is doubtless a good argument against the innovation; but that "Johnson and Addison" are fit representatives of the older "practice" in this case, may be doubted. I know not that the latter has anywhere made use of such phraseology; and one or two examples from the former are scarcely an offset to his positive verdict against the usage. See OBS. 3rd, above.</p>
<p>OBS. 10.--As to what is called "<i>the present</i> or <i>the imperfect participle</i> passive<i>,"--as, "</i>being burned<i>," or "</i>being burnt<i>,"--if it is rightly</i> interpreted in <i>any</i> of the foregoing citations, it is, beyond question, very improperly <i>thus</i> named. In participles, <i>ing</i> denotes <i>continuance</i>: thus <i>being</i> usually means <i>continuing to be; loving, continuing to love;</i> building, continuing to build<i>,--or (as taken passively)</i> continuing to be built<i>: i. e., (in words which express the sense more precisely and</i> certainly,) <i>continuing to be in process of construction</i>. What then is "being built," but "<i>continuing to be built</i>," the same, or nearly the same, as "<i>building</i>" taken passively? True it is, that <i>built</i>, when alone, being a perfect participle, does not mean "<i>in process of</i> construction<i>," but rather, "</i>constructed<i>" which intimates</i> completion<i>;</i> yet, in the foregoing passive phrases, and others like them, as well as in all examples of this unco-passive voice, continuance of the passive state being first suggested, and cessation of the act being either regarded as future or disregarded, the imperfect participle passive is for the most part received as equivalent to the simple imperfect used in a passive sense. But Dr. Bullions, who, after making "<i>is being built</i> precisely equivalent to <i>is built</i>," classes the two participles differently, and both erroneously,--the one as a "<i>present</i> participle," and the other, of late, as a "<i>past</i>,"--has also said above, "'<i>Built</i>,' is a <i>perfect</i> participle: and THEREFORE cannot, in <i>any connexion</i>, express an action, or the suffering of an action, <i>now in progress</i>." And Dr. Perley, who also calls the compound of <i>being</i> a "<i>present</i> participle," argues thus: "<i>Being built</i> signifies an <i>action, finished</i>; and how can <i>Is being</i> built<i>, signify an</i> action unfinished<i>?" To expound a</i> passive <i>term</i> <i>actively</i>, or as "signifying <i>action</i>," is, at any rate, a near approach to absurdity; and I shall presently show that the fore-cited notion of "a perfect participle," now half abandoned by Bullions himself, has been the seed of the very worst form of that ridiculous neology which the good Doctor was opposing.</p>
<p>OBS. 11.--These criticisms being based upon the <i>meaning</i> of certain participles, either alone or in phrases, and the particular terms spoken of being chiefly meant to represent <i>classes</i>, what is said of them may be understood of their <i>kinds</i>. Hence the appropriate <i>naming</i> of the kinds, so as to convey no false idea of any participle's import, is justly brought into view; and I may be allowed to say here, that, for the first participle passive, which begins with "<i>being</i>," the epithet "<i>Imperfect</i>" is better than "<i>Present</i>," because this compound participle denotes, not always what is <i>present</i>, but always <i>the state</i> of something by which an action is, <i>or was, or will be, undergone or undergoing--a state continuing</i>, or so regarded, though perhaps the action causative may be ended--or sometimes perhaps imagined only, and not yet really begun. With a marvellous instability of doctrine, for the professed systematizer of different languages and grammars, Dr. Bullions has recently changed his names of the second and third participles, in both voices, from "<i>Perfect</i>" and "<i>Compound Perfect</i>," to "<i>Past</i>" and "<i>Perfect</i>." His notion now is, that, "<i>The Perfect</i> participle is always compound; as, <i>Having finished, Having</i> been finished<i>."--</i>Bullions's Analyt. and Pract. Grammar<i>, 1849, p. 77. And</i> what was the "<i>Perfect</i>" before, in his several books, is now called the "<i>Past</i>;" though, with this change, he has deliberately made an other which is repugnant to it: this participle, being the basis of three tenses always, and of all the tenses sometimes, is now allowed by the Doctor to lend the term "<i>perfect</i>" to the three,--"<i>Present-perfect, Past-perfect,</i> Future-perfect,"<i>--even when itself is named otherwise!</i></p>
<p>OBS. 12.--From the erroneous conception, that a perfect participle must, in every connexion, express "<i>action finished</i>," <i>action past</i>,--or perhaps from only a moiety of this great error,--the notion that such a participle cannot, in connexion with an auxiliary, constitute a passive verb of the <i>present tense</i>,--J. W. Wright, above-mentioned, has not very unnaturally reasoned, that, "The expression, '<i>I am loved</i>,' which Mr. Murray has employed to exhibit the passive conjugation of the <i>present tense</i>, may much more <i>feasibly</i> represent <i>past</i> than <i>present</i> time."--See <i>Wright's</i> Philosophical Gram.<i>, p. 99. Accordingly, in his own paradigm of the</i> passive verb, he has formed <i>this</i> tense solely from what he calls the participle <i>present</i>, thus: "I <i>am being smitten</i>, Thou <i>art being</i> smitten<i>," &amp;c.--</i>Ib.<i>, p. 98. His "</i>Passed Tense<i>," too, for some reason</i> which I do not discover, he distinguishes above the rest by a <i>double</i> form<i>, thus: "I</i> was smitten, or being smitten<i>; Thou</i> wast smitten, or being smitten<i>;" &amp;c.--P. 99. In his opinion, "Few will object to</i> the propriety of <i>the more familiar phraseology, <b>I am in the</b></i> <b>ACT,--or,</b> <i>suffering</i> the ACTION <i>of</i> BEING SMITTEN;' and yet," says he, "in substance and effect, it is wholly the same as, '<i>I am being smitten</i>,' which is THE TRUE FORM of the verb in the <i>present</i> tense of the <i>passive</i> voice!<i>"--</i>Ibid. <i>Had we not met with some similar expressions of English</i> or American blunderers, "the <i>act</i> or <i>action of being smitten</i>," would be accounted a downright Irish bull; and as to this ultra notion of neologizing all our passive verbs, by the addition of "<i>being</i>,"--with the author's cool talk of "<i>the presentation of this theory, and</i> [<i>the</i>] <i>consequent suppression of that hitherto employed</i>,"--there is a transcendency in it, worthy of the most sublime aspirant among grammatical newfanglers.</p>
<p>OBS. 13.--But, with all its boldness of innovation, Wright's Philosophical Grammar is not a little <i>self-contradictory</i> in its treatment of the passive verb. The entire "suppression" of the usual form of its present tense, did not always appear, even to this author, quite so easy and reasonable a matter, as the foregoing citations would seem to represent it. The passive use of the participle in <i>ing</i>, he has easily disposed of: despite innumerable authorities for it, one false assertion, of seven syllables, suffices to make it quite impossible.[269] But the usual passive form, which, with some show of truth, is accused of not having always precisely the same meaning as the progressive used passively,--that is, of not always denoting <i>continuance in the state of receiving continued</i> action<i>,--and which is, for that remarkable reason, judged worthy of</i> <i>rejection</i>, is nevertheless admitted to have, in very many instances, a conformity to this idea, and therefore to "belong [thus far] to the present tense."--P. 103. This contradicts to an indefinite extent, the proposition for its rejection. It is observable also, that the same examples, <b>I am</b> loved <b>and 'I <i>am smitten</i>,'--the same "<i>tolerated, but erroneous forms</i>,"</b> (so called on page 103,) that are given as specimens of what he would reject,--though at first pronounced "<i>equivalent</i> in grammatical construction," censured for the same pretended error, and proposed to be changed alike to "<i>the true form</i>" by the insertion of "<i>being</i>,"--are subsequently declared to "belong to" different classes and different tenses. "<i>I am loved</i>," is referred to that "numerous" class of verbs, which "<i>detail</i> ACTION <i>of prior, but retained, endured, and continued</i> existence<i>; and therefore, in this sense,</i> belong to the present tense<i>."</i> But "<i>I am smitten</i>," is idly reckoned of an opposite class, (said by Dr. Bullions to be "perhaps the greater number,") whose "ACTIONS described are neither <i>continuous</i> in their nature, nor <i>progressive</i> in their duration; but, on the contrary, <i>completed</i> and <i>perfected</i>; and [which] are consequently descriptive of <i>passed</i> time and ACTION."--<i>Wright's Gram.</i>, p. 103. Again: "In what instance soever this latter form and signification <i>can</i> be introduced, <i>their import should be, and, indeed, ought to be,</i> supplied by the perfect tense construction<i>:--for example, '</i>I am smitten<i>,' [should] be, <b>I have been smitten</b></i><b>.'"--<i>Ib.</i> Here is</b> self-contradiction indefinitely extended <i>in an other way</i>. Many a good phrase, if not every one, that the author's first suggestion would turn to the unco-passive form, his present "<i>remedy</i>" would about as absurdly convert into "the perfect tense."</p>
<p>OBS. 14.--But Wright's inconsistency, about this matter, ends not here: it runs through all he says of it; for, in this instance, error and inconsistency constitute his whole story. In one place, he anticipates and answers a question thus: "To what tense do the constructions, 'I am pleased;' 'He is expected;' '<i>I am smitten</i>;' 'He is bound;' belong?" "We answer:--<i>So far as</i> these and like constructions are applicable to the delineation of <i>continuous</i> and <i>retained</i> ACTION, they express <i>present</i> time; and must be treated accordingly."--P. 103. This seems to intimate that even, "<i>I am smitten</i>," and its likes, as they stand, may have some good claim to be of the present tense; which suggestion is contrary to several others made by the author. To expound this, or any other passive term, <i>passively</i>, never enters his mind: with him, as with sundry others, "ACTION," "<i>finished</i> ACTION," or "<i>progressive</i> ACTION," is all any <i>passive</i> verb or participle ever means! No marvel, that awkward perversions of the forms of utterance and the principles of grammar should follow such interpretation. In Wright's syntax a very queer distinction is apparently made between a passive verb, and the participle chiefly constituting it; and here, too, through a fancied ellipsis of "<i>being</i>" before the latter, most, if not all, of his other positions concerning passives, are again disastrously overthrown by something worse--a word "<i>imperceptibly understood</i>." "<b>I am smitten<i>;'</i></b> <i>I was smitten</i>;' &amp;c., are," he says, "the <i>universally acknowledged forms</i> of the VERBS in these tenses, in the passive voice:--not of the <i>PARTICIPLE</i>. In all verbal constructions of the character of which we have hitherto treated, (see page 103) <i>and, where</i> the ACTIONS described are <i>continuous</i> in their <i>operations</i>,--the participle BEING is <i>imperceptibly omitted, by</i> ellipsis<i>."--P. 144.</i></p>
<p>OBS. 15.--Dr. Bullions has stated, that, "The present participle active, and the present participle passive, are <i>not counterparts</i> to each other in signification; [,] the one signifying the present doing, and the other the present suffering of an action, [;] for the latter <i>always intimates the</i> present being of an <i>ACT,</i> not in progress, but completed<i>."--</i>Prin. of Eng. Gram.<i>, p. 58. In this, he errs no less grossly than in his idea of</i> the "<i>action</i> or the suffering" expressed by "a <i>perfect</i> participle," as cited in OBS. 5th above; namely, that it must have <i>ceased</i>. Worse interpretation, or balder absurdity, is scarcely to be met with; and yet the reverend Doctor, great linguist as he should be, was here only trying to think and tell the common import of a very common sort of <i>English</i> participles; such as, "<i>being loved</i>" and "<i>being seen</i>." In grammar, "<i>an</i> act<i>," that has "</i>present being<i>," can be nothing else than an act now</i> doing, or "<i>in progress</i>;" and if, "<i>the present being of an</i> ACT <i>not in</i> progress<i>," were here a possible thought, it surely could not be intimated</i> by any <i>such</i> participle. In Acts, i, 3 and 4, it is stated, that our Saviour showed himself to the apostles, "alive after his passion, by many infallible proofs, <i>being seen</i> of them forty days, and <i>speaking</i> of the things <i>pertaining</i> to the kingdom of God; and, <i>being assembled</i> together with them commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem." Now, of these misnamed "<i>present</i> participles," we have here one "<i>active</i>," one "<i>passive</i>," and two others--(one in each form--) that are <i>neuter</i>; but <i>no present time</i>, except what is in the indefinite date of "<i>pertaining</i>." The events are past, and were so in the days of St. Luke. Yet each of the participles denotes <i>continuance</i>: not, indeed, in or to the <i>present</i> time<i>, but</i> for a time<i>. "</i>Being seen<i>" means</i> continuing to be seen<i>; and,</i> in this instance, the period of the continuance was "forty days" of time past. But, according to the above-cited "<i>principle of English Grammar</i>," so long and so widely inculcated by "the Rev. Peter Bullions, D. D., Professor of Languages," &amp;c.,--a central principle of interpretation, presumed by him to hold "<i>always</i>"--this participle must intimate "<i>the</i> present being of an act, not in progress, but completed<i>;"--that is, "</i>the present being of" the apostles' act in formerly seeing the risen Saviour<i>!</i></p>
<p>OBS. 16.--This grammarian has lately taken a deal of needless pains to sustain, by a studied division of verbs into two classes, similar to those which are mentioned in OBS. 13th above, a part of the philosophy of J. W. Wright, concerning our usual form of passives in the present tense. But, as he now will have it, that the two voices sometimes tally as counterparts, it is plain that he adheres but partially to his former erroneous conception of a perfect or "past" participle, and the terms which hold it "in any connexion." The awkward substitutes proposed by the Irish critic, he does not indeed countenance; but argues against them still, and, in some respects, very justly. The doctrine now common to these authors, on this point, is the highly important one, that, in respect to half our verbs, what we commonly take for the passive present, <i>is not such</i>--that, in "the <i>second</i> class, (perhaps the greater number,) the <i>present-passive</i> implies that <i>the act expressed by the active voice has ceased</i>. Thus, 'The house is built.' * * * Strictly speaking, then," says the Doctor, "the PAST PARTICIPLE with the verb TO BE <i>is not the present tense in the passive</i> voice of verbs thus used<i>; that is, this form does not express passively</i> the <i>doing</i> of the act."--<i>Bullions's Analyt. and Pract. Grammar</i>, Ed. of 1849, p. 235. Thus far these two authors agree; except that Wright seems to have avoided the incongruity of <i>calling</i> that "<i>the present-passive</i>" which he <i>denies</i> to be such. But the Doctor, approving none of this practitioner's "remedies," and being less solicitous to provide other treatment than expulsion for the thousands of present passives which both deem spurious, adds, as from the chair, this verdict: "These verbs either <i>have no present-passive</i>, or it is made by annexing the participle in <i>ing</i>, in its passive sense, to the verb <i>to be</i>; as, 'The house <i>is</i> building<i>.'"--</i>Ib.<i>, p. 236.</i></p>
<p>OBS. 17.--It would seem, that Dr. Bullions thinks, and in reality Wright also, that nothing can be a present passive, but what "<i>expresses passively</i> the <i>DOING</i> of the act<i>." This is about as wise, as to try to imagine every</i> active verb to <i>express actively the receiving of an act</i>! It borders exceedingly hard upon absurdity; it very much resembles the nonsense of "<i>expressing receptively the giving of something</i>!" Besides, the word "DOING," being used substantively, does not determine well what is here meant; which is, I suppose, <i>continuance</i>, or an <i>unfinished state</i> of the act received--an idea which seems adapted to the participle in <i>ing</i>, but which it is certainly no fault of a participle ending in <i>d, t</i>, or <i>n</i>, not to suggest. To "<i>express passively the doing of the act</i>," if the language means any thing rational, may be, simply to say, that the act <i>is</i> or <i>was done</i>. For "<i>doings</i>" are, as often as any-wise, "<i>things done</i>," as <i>buildings</i> are <i>fabrics built</i>; and "<i>is built</i>," and "<i>am smitten</i>," the gentlemen's choice examples of <i>false passives</i>, and of "<i>actions</i> finished<i>,"--though neither of them necessarily intimates either</i> continuance or cessation of the act suffered, or, if it did, would be the less or the more passive or present,--may, in such a sense, "express <i>the</i> doing <i>of the act," if any passives can:--nay, the "finished act" has such</i> completion as may be stated with degrees of progress or of frequency; as, "The house <i>is partly built</i>."--"I <i>am oftener smitten</i>." There is, undoubtedly, some difference between the assertions, "The house <i>is</i> building<i>,"--and, "The house</i> is partly built<i>;" though, for practical</i> purposes, perhaps, we need not always be very nice in choosing between them. For the sake of variety, however, if for nothing else, it is to be hoped, the doctrine above-cited, which limits half our passive verbs of the present tense, <i>to the progressive form only</i>, will not soon be generally approved. It impairs the language more than unco-passives are likely ever to corrupt it.</p>
<p>OBS. 18.--"No <i>startling novelties</i> have been introduced," says the preface to the "Analytical and Practical Grammar of the English Language." To have shunned all shocking innovations, is only to have exercised common prudence. It is not pretended, that any of the Doctor's errors here remarked upon, or elsewhere in this treatise, will <i>startle</i> any body; but, if errors exist, even in plausible guise, it may not be amiss, if I tell of them. To suppose every verb or participle to be either "<i>transitive</i>" or "<i>intransitive</i>," setting all <i>passives</i> with the former sort, all <i>neuters</i> with the latter; (p. 59;)--to define the <i>transitive</i> verb or participle as expressing always "<i>an act</i> DONE <i>by one person or thing to</i> another<i>;" (p. 60;)--to say, after making passive verbs transitive, "The</i> object of a transitive verb is in the <i>objective case</i>," and, "A verb that does not make sense with an objective after it, is intransitive;" (p. 60;)--to insist upon a precise and almost universal <i>identity of "meaning</i>" in terms so obviously <i>contrasted</i> as are the two voices, "active" and "passive;" (pp. 95 and 235;)--to allege, as a general principle, "that whether we use the active, or the passive voice, <i>the meaning is the same</i>, except in some cases in the present tense;" (p. 67;)--to attribute to the forms naturally opposite in voice and sense, that sameness of meaning which is observable only in certain <i>whole sentences</i> formed from them; (pp. 67, 95, and 235;)--to assume that each "VOICE is a particular <i>form of the</i> verb<i>," yet make it include</i> two cases<i>, and often a preposition before one</i> of them; (pp. 66, 67, and 95;)--to pretend from the words, "The PASSIVE VOICE represents the subject of the verb as <i>acted upon</i>," (p. 67,) that, "<i>According to the</i> DEFINITION, the passive voice expresses, passively, <i>the same thing</i> that the active does actively;" (p. 235;)--to affirm that, "'Cæsar <i>conquered</i> Gaul,' and 'Gaul <i>was conquered</i> by Cæsar,' express <i>precisely the same idea</i>,"--and then say, "It will be felt at once that the expressions, 'Cæsar <i>conquers</i> Gaul,' and 'Gaul <i>is conquered</i> by Cæsar,' <i>do not express the same thing</i>;" (p. 235;)--to deny that passive verbs or neuter are worthy to constitute a distinct class, yet profess to find, in one single tense of the former, such a difference of meaning as warrants a general division of verbs in respect to it; (<i>ib.</i>;)--to announce, in bad English, that, "<i>In regard to this matter</i> [,] there are evidently Two CLASSES of verbs; namely, those <i>whose</i> present-passive expresses precisely the same thing, passively, as the active voice does actively, and those <i>in which it</i> does not:" (<i>ib.</i>;)--to do these several things, as they have been done, is, to set forth, not "novelties" only, but errors and inconsistencies.</p>
<p>OBS. 19.--Dr. Bullions still adheres to his old argument, that <i>being</i> after its own verb must be devoid of meaning; or, in his own words, "that <i>is being built</i>, if it mean anything, can mean nothing more than <i>is</i> built<i>, which is not the idea intended to be expressed."--</i>Analyt. and Pract. Gram.<i>, p. 237. He had said, (as cited in OBS. 5th above,) "The</i> expression, '<i>is being</i>,' is equivalent to <i>is</i>, and expresses <i>no more</i>; just as, <b>is loving<i>,' is equivalent to</i></b> <i>loves</i>.' Hence, <b>is being</b> built<i>,' is precisely equivalent to '</i>is built<i>.'"--</i>Principles of E. Gram.<i>, p. 58. He has now discovered "that</i> there is no progressive form of the verb <i>to be</i>, and no need of it:" and that, "hence, <i>there is no</i> such expression <i>in English as</i> is being<i>."--</i>Analyt. and Pract. Gram.<i>, p.</i> 236. He should have noticed also, that "<i>is loving</i>" is not an authorized "equivalent to <i>loves</i>;" and, further, that the error of saying "<i>is being</i> built<i>," is only in the relation of the</i> first two words <i>to each other. If</i> "<i>is being</i>," and "<i>is loving</i>," are left unused for the same reason, the truth may be, that <i>is</i> itself, like <i>loves</i>, commonly denotes "<i>continuance</i>;" and that <i>being</i> after it, in stead of being necessary or proper, can only be awkwardly tautologous. This is, in fact, THE GRAND OBJECTION to the new phraseology--"<i>is being practised</i>"--"<i>am being</i> smitten<i>"--and the like. Were there no danger that petty writers would one</i> day seize upon it with like avidity, an other innovation, exactly similar to this in every thing but tense--similar in awkwardness, in tautology, in unmistakeableness--might here be uttered for the sake of illustration. Some men conceive, that "The <i>perfect</i> participle is always compound; as, <i>having seen, having written</i>;"--and that the simple word, <i>seen</i> or <i>written</i>, had originally, and still ought to have, only a passive construction. For such views, they find authorities. Hence, in lieu of the common phrases, "<i>had we seen</i>," "<i>we have written</i>," they adopt such English as this; "<i>Had we having seen</i> you, we should have stopped."--"<i>We</i> have having written <i>but just now, to our correspondent." Now, "</i>We are being smitten<i>," is no better grammar than this;--and no worse: "The idea</i> intended" is in no great jeopardy in either case.</p>
<p>OBS. 20.--J. R. Chandler, of Philadelphia, in his Common School Grammar of 1847, has earnestly undertaken the <i>defence</i> of this new and much-mooted passive expression: which he calls "<i>the Definite Passive Voice</i>," or "<i>the</i> Passive Voice of the Definite Form<i>." He admits it, however, to be a form</i> that "does not <i>sound well</i>,"--a "<i>novelty</i> that strikes the ear unpleasantly;" but he will have the defect to be, not in the tautologous conceit of "<i>is being</i>," "<i>was being</i>," "<i>has been being</i>," and the like, but in everybody's organ of hearing,--supposing all ears corrupted, "from infancy," to a distaste for correct speech, by "the habit of <i>hearing</i> and using words <i>ungrammatically</i>!"--See p. 89. Claiming this new form as "<i>the</i> true passive<i>," in just contrast with the progressive active, he not only</i> rebukes all attempts "to evade" the use of it, "by some real or supposed <i>equivalent</i>," but also declares, that, "The attempt to deprive the transitive definite verb of [this] <i>its passive voice</i>, is <i>to strike at</i> the foundation of the language<i>, and</i> to strip it of one of its most important qualities<i>; that of making both actor and sufferer, each in turn</i> and at pleasure, the subject of conversation."--<i>Ibid.</i> Concerning <i>equivalents</i>, he evidently argues fallaciously; for he urges, that the using of them "<i>does not dispense with the necessity of the definite</i> passive voice<i>."--P. 88. But it is plain, that, of the many fair</i> substitutes which may in most cases be found, if any one is preferred, this form, and all the rest, are of course rejected for the time.</p>
<p>OBS. 21.--By Chandler, as well as others, this new passive form is justified only on the supposition, that the simple participle in <i>ing</i> can never with propriety be used passively. No plausible argument, indeed, can be framed for it, without the assumption, that the simpler form, when used in the same sense, <i>is ungrammatical</i>. But this is, in fact, a begging of the main question; and that, in opposition to abundant authority for the usage condemned. (See OBS. 3d, above.) This author pretends that, "<i>The</i> RULE of all grammarians <i>declares the verb</i> is<i>, and a</i> present participle (<i>is building</i>, or <i>is writing</i>), to be in the active voice" only.--P. 88. (I add the word "<i>only</i>," but this is what he means, else he merely quibbles.) Now in this idea he is wrong, and so are the several grammarians who support the principle of this imaginary "<i>RULE</i>." The opinion of critics in general would be better represented by the following suggestions of the Rev. W. Allen: "When the English verb does not signify <i>mental</i> affection<i>, the distinction of voice is often disregarded: thus we say,</i> <i>actively</i>, they <i>were selling</i> fruit; and, <i>passively</i>, the books <i>are</i> now <i>selling</i>. The same remark applies to the participle used as a noun: as, actively, <i>drawing</i> is an elegant amusement, <i>building</i> is expensive; and, passively, his <i>drawings</i> are good, this is a fine <i>building</i>."--<i>Allen's Elements of E. Gram.</i>, p. 82.</p>
<p>OBS. 22.--Chandler admits, that, "When it is said, 'The house is <i>building</i>,' the meaning is easily obtained; though," he strangely insists, "<i>it is exactly opposite to the assertion</i>."--P. 89. He endeavours to show, moreover, by a fictitious example made for the purpose, that the progressive form, if used in both voices, will be liable to ambiguity. It may, perhaps, be so in some instances; but, were there weight enough in the objection to condemn the passive usage altogether, one would suppose there might be found, somewhere, <i>an actual example or two</i> of the abuse. Not concurring with Dr. Bullions in the notion that the active voice and the passive usually "express precisely the same thing," this critic concludes his argument with the following sentence: "There is an <i>important</i> difference <i>between</i> doing <i>and</i> suffering<i>; and that</i> difference is grammatically shown <i>by the appropriate use of the active and passive</i> voices of a verb."--<i>Chandler's Common School Gram.</i>, p. 89.</p>
<p>OBS. 23.--The opinion given at the close of OBS. 2d above, was first published in 1833. An opposite doctrine, with the suggestion that it is "<i>improper</i> to say, <b>the house is building<i>,' instead of 'the house</i> is</b> being built<i>,'"--is found on page 64th of the Rev. David Blair's Grammar,</i> of 1815,--"Seventh Edition," with a preface dated, "<i>October 20th</i>, 1814." To any grammarian who wrote at a period much earlier than that, the question about <i>unco-passives</i> never occurred. Many critics have passed judgement upon them since, and so generally with reprobation, that the man must have more hardihood than sense, who will yet disgust his readers or hearers with them.[270] That "This new form has been used by <i>some</i> respectable writers<i>," we need not deny; but let us look at the given</i> "<i>instances of it</i>: 'For those who <i>are being educated</i> in our seminaries.' R. SOUTHEY.--'It <i>was being uttered</i>.' COLERIDGE.--'The foundation <i>was</i> being laid<i>.' BRIT. CRITIC."--</i>English Grammar with Worcester's Univ. and Crit. Dict.<i>, p. xlvi. Here, for the first example, it would be much better</i> to say, "For those who <i>are educated</i>," [271]--or, "who <i>are receiving</i> their education<i>;" for the others, "It</i> was uttering<i>,"--"</i>was uttered<i>,"--or, "</i>was in uttering<i>."--"The foundation</i> was laying<i>,"--"</i>was laid<i>,"--or, "</i>was about being laid<i>." Worcester's opinion of the "new</i> form" is to be inferred from his manner of naming it in the following sentence: "Within a few years, a <i>strange and awkward</i> neologism has been introduced, by which the <i>present passive participle</i> is substituted, in such cases as the above, for the participle in <i>ing</i>."--<i>Ibid.</i> He has two instances more, in each of which the phrase is linked with an expression of disapprobation; "' It <a href="http://en.wikisource.org/w/index.php?title=Greek:_tetymmenos&action=edit&redlink=1" class="new" title="Greek: tetymmenos (page does not exist)">Greek: tetymmenos</a> signifies properly, though <i>in</i> uncouth English<i>, one who</i> is being beaten<i>.' ABP. WHATELY.--'The bridge</i> <i>is being built</i>, and other phrases of the like kind, <i>have</i> pained the eye.' D. BOOTH."--<i>Ibid.</i>[272]</p>
<p>OBS. 24.--Richard Hiley, in the third edition of his Grammar, published in London, in 1840, after showing the passive use of the participle in <i>ing</i>, proceeds thus: "No ambiguity arises, we presume, from the use of the participle in this manner. To avoid, however, affixing a passive signification to the participle in <i>ing</i>, an attempt has lately been made to substitute the passive participle in its place. Thus instead of 'The house was <i>building</i>,' 'The work <i>imprinting</i>,' we sometimes hear, 'The house was <i>being built</i>,' 'The work is <i>being printed</i>.' But this mode is <i>contrary to the English idiom</i>, and has not yet obtained the sanction of reputable authority."--<i>Hiley's Gram.</i>, p. 30.</p>
<p>OBS. 25.--Professor Hart, of Philadelphia, whose English Grammar was first published in 1845, justly prefers the usage which takes the progressive form occasionally in a passive sense; but, in arguing against the new substitute, he evidently remoulds the early reasoning of Dr. Bullions, errors and all; a part of which he introduces thus: "I know the correctness of this mode of expression has lately been very much assailed, and an attempt, to some extent successful, has been made [,] to introduce the form [,] <b>is being built.</b> But, in the first place, the old mode of expression is a well established usage of the language, being found in our best and most correct writers. Secondly, <i>is being built</i> does not convey the idea intended, [;] namely [,] that of <i>progressive action. Is being</i>, taken together, means simply <i>is</i>, just as <i>is writing</i> means <i>writes</i>; therefore, <i>is being built</i> means <i>is built</i>, a perfect and not a progressive ACTION. Or, if <i>being</i> [and] <i>built</i> be taken together, <i>they</i> signify an <i>ACTION COMPLETE, and the phrase means, as before,</i> the house is <i>(EXISTS)</i> being built<i>."--</i>Hart's Gram.<i>, p. 76. The last three</i> sentences here are liable to many objections, some of which are suggested above.</p>
<p>OBS. 26.--It is important, that the central phraseology of our language be so understood, as not to be <i>misinterpreted with credit</i>, or falsely expounded by popular critics and teachers. Hence errors of <i>exposition</i> are the more particularly noticed in these observations. In "<i>being built</i>," Prof. Hart, like sundry authors named above, finds nothing but "ACTION COMPLETE." Without doubt, Butler interprets better, when he says, "'The house <i>is built</i>,' denotes an <i>existing state</i>, rather than a <i>completed</i> action<i>." But this author, too, in his next three sentences, utters as many</i> errors; for he adds: "The name of the agent <i>cannot be expressed</i> in phrases of this kind. We <i>cannot say</i>, 'The house is built <i>by John</i>.' When we say, 'The house is built by mechanics,' we <i>do not express an existing</i> state<i>."--</i>Butler's Practical Gram.<i>, p. 80. Unquestionably, "</i>is built by mechanics<i>," expresses</i> nothing else <i>than the "</i>existing state<i>" of being</i> "built by mechanics," together with an affirmation:--that is, the "existing state" of receiving the action of mechanics, is affirmed of "the house." And, in my judgement, one may very well say, "<i>The house is built by</i> John<i>;" meaning, "</i>John is building the house.<i>" St. Paul says, "Every</i> house <i>is builded by</i> SOME MAN."--<i>Heb.</i>, iii, 4. In this text, the common "name of the agent" is "expressed."</p>
<p>OBS. 27.--Wells and Weld, whose grammars date from 1846, being remarkably chary of finding anything wrong in "respectable writers," hazard no opinion of their own, concerning the correctness or incorrectness of either of the usages under discussion. They do not always see absurdity in the approbation of opposites; yet one should here, perhaps, count them with the majorities they allow. The latter says, "The participle in <i>ing</i> is sometimes used passively; as, forty and six years was this temple in <i>building</i>; not in <i>being built</i>."--<i>Weld's English Gram.</i>, 2d Ed., p. 170. Here, if he means to suggest, that "<i>in being built</i>" would "not" be good English, he teaches very erroneously; if his thought is, that this phrase would "not" express the sense of the former one, "<i>in building</i>," he palpably contradicts his own position! But he proceeds, in a note, thus: "The form of expression, <i>is being built, is being committed</i>, &amp;c., is almost universally condemned by grammarians; but it is <i>sometimes</i> met with in respectable writers. It occurs most frequently in newspaper paragraphs, and in hasty compositions."--<i>Ibid.</i> Wells comments thus: "Different opinions have long existed among critics respecting this passive use of the imperfect participle. Many respectable writers substitute the compound passive participle; as, 'The house is <i>being built</i>;' 'The book is <i>being</i> printed<i>.' But the prevailing practice of the best authors is in favor of</i> the <i>simple form</i>; as, 'The house <i>is building</i>.'"--<i>Wells's School Gram.</i>, 1st Ed., p. 148; 113th Ed., p. 161.[273]</p>
<p>OBS. 28.--S. W. Clark, in the second edition of his Practical Grammar, stereotyped and published in New York in 1848, appears to favour the insertion of "<i>being</i>" into passive verbs; but his instructions are so obscure, so often inaccurate, and so incompatible one with an other, that it is hard to say, with certainty, what he approves. In one place, he has this position: "The Passive Voice of a verb is formed by adding the <i>Passive Participle</i> of that verb, to the verb <i>be</i>. EXAMPLES--To <i>be</i> loved. I <i>am</i> feared. They <i>are</i> worshipped."--Page 69. In an other, he has this: "When the Subject is to be represented as receiving the action, <i>the</i> Passive Participle <i>should be used. EXAMPLE--Henry's</i> lesson <i>is BEING</i> RECITED."--P. 132. Now these two positions utterly confound each other; for they are equally general, and "<i>the Passive Participle</i>" is first one thing, and then an other. Again, he has the following assertions, both false: "The Present (or First) Participle <i>always</i> ends in <i>ing</i>, and is <i>limited to the Active Voice</i>. The Past (or Second) Participle of Regular Verbs ends in <i>d</i> or <i>ed</i>, and is <i>limited to the Passive Voice</i>."--P. 131. Afterwards, in spite of the fancied limitation, he acknowledges the passive use of the participle in <i>ing</i>, and that there is "<i>authority</i>" for it; but, at the same time, most absurdly supposes the word to predicate "<i>action</i>," and also to be <i>wrong</i>: saying, "<i>Action</i> is <i>sometimes</i> predicated of a <i>passive</i> subject. EXAMPLE--'The <i>house is building</i>,.. for.. 'The <i>house is being built</i>,'.. which means.. The house <i>is becoming</i> built<i>." On this, he remarks thus: "This is one of the instances in which</i> <i>Authority</i> is against <i>Philosophy</i>. For an <i>act</i> cannot <i>properly</i> be predicated of a <i>passive agent</i>. Many good writers <i>properly reject</i> this idiom. 'Mansfield's prophecy <i>is being realized</i>.'--MICHELET'S LUTHER."--<i>Clark's Practical Gram.</i>, p. 133. It may require some study to learn from this <i>which idiom it is</i>. that these "many good writers reject:" but the grammarian who can talk of "<i>a passive agent</i>," without perceiving that the phrase is self-contradictory and absurd, may well be expected to entertain a "Philosophy" which is against "Authority," and likewise to prefer a ridiculous innovation to good and established usage.</p>
<p>OBS. 29.--As most verbs are susceptible of both forms, the simple active and the compound or progressive, and likewise of a transitive and an intransitive sense in each; and as many, when taken intransitively, may have a meaning which is scarcely distinguishable from that of the passive form; it often happens that this substitution of the imperfect participle passive for the simple imperfect in <i>ing</i>, is quite needless, even when the latter is not considered passive. For example: "See by the following paragraph, how widely the bane <i>is being circulated!</i>"--<i>Liberator</i>, No. 999, p. 34. Here <i>is circulating</i> would be better; and so would <i>is circulated</i>. Nor would either of these much vary the sense, if at all; for "<i>circulate</i>" may mean, according to Webster, "<i>to be diffused</i>," or, as Johnson and Worcester have it, "<i>to be dispersed</i>." See the second marginal note on p. 378.</p>
<p>OBS. 30.--R. G. Parker appears to have formed a just opinion of the "modern innovation," the arguments for which are so largely examined in the foregoing observations; but the "principle" which he adduces as "conclusive" against it, if <i>principle</i> it can be called, has scarcely any bearing on the question; certainly no more than has the simple assertion of one reputable critic, that our participle in <i>ing</i> may occasionally be used passively. "Such expressions as the following," says he, "have recently become very common, not only in the periodical publications of the day, but are likewise finding favor with popular writers; as, 'The house <i>is being</i> built<i>.' 'The street</i> is being paved<i>.' 'The actions that</i> are <i>now</i> being performed<i>,' &amp;c. 'The patents</i> are being prepared<i>.' The usage of the best</i> writers does not sanction these expressions; and Mr. Pickbourn lays down the following principle, which is conclusive upon the subject. <b>Whenever</b> the participle <i>in</i> ing <i>is joined by an auxiliary verb to a nominative</i> capable of the action, it is taken actively; but, when joined to one incapable of the action, it becomes passive. If we say, <i>The man are</i> building a house<i>, the participle</i> building <i>is evidently used in an active</i> sense; <i>because</i> the men are capable of the action. But when we say, <i>The</i> house is building<i>, or,</i> Patents are preparing<i>, the participles</i> building and <i>preparing</i> must necessarily be understood in a passive sense; because neither the house nor the patents are capable of action.'--See Pickbourn on the English Verb, pp. 78-80."--<i>Parker's Aids to English Composition</i>, p. 105. Pickbourn wrote his Dissertation before the question arose which he is here supposed to decide. Nor is he right in assuming that the common Progressive Form, of which he speaks, must be either <i>active-transitive</i> or <i>passive</i>: I have shown above that it may be <i>active-intransitive</i>, and perhaps, in a few instances, <i>neuter</i>. The class of the verb is determined by something else than the mere <i>capableness</i> of the "<i>nominative</i>."</p>

<p>III. FORM OF PASSIVE VERBS.</p>
<p>Passive verbs, in English, are always of a compound form; being made from active-transitive verbs, by adding the Perfect Participle to the auxiliary verb BE, through all its changes: thus from the active-transitive verb <i>love</i>, is formed the passive verb <i>be</i> loved<i>.</i></p>

<p><br>
OBSERVATIONS.</p>
<p>OBS. 1.--A few active-intransitive verbs, that signify mere motion, change of place, or change of condition, may be put into this form, with a <i>neuter</i> signification; making not <i>passive</i> but <i>neuter</i> verbs, which express nothing more than the state which results from the change: as, "<i>I</i> am come<i>."--"She</i> is gone<i>."--"He</i> is risen<i>."--"They</i> are fallen<i>." These</i> are what Dr. Johnson and some others call "<i>neuter</i> passives;" a name which never was very proper, and for which we have no frequent use.</p>
<p>OBS. 2.--Most neuter verbs of the passive form, such as, "<i>am grown, art</i> become, is lain, are flown, are vanished, are departed, was sat, were arrived<i>," may now be considered errors of conjugation, or perhaps of</i> syntax. In the verb, <i>to be mistaken</i>, there is an irregularity which ought to be particularly noticed. When applied to <i>persons</i>, this verb is commonly taken in a <i>neuter</i> sense, and signifies, <i>to be in error, to be</i> wrong<i>; as, "I</i> am mistaken<i>, thou</i> art mistaken<i>, he</i> is mistake<i>." But,</i> when used of <i>things</i>, it is a proper passive verb, and signifies, <i>to be</i> misunderstood<i>, or</i> to be taken wrong<i>; as, "The sense of the passage</i> is mistaken<i>; that is, not rightly understood." See</i> Webster's Dict., w. Mistaken<i>. "I have known a shadow across a brook</i> to be mistaken <i>for a</i> footbridge."</p>
<p>OBS. 3.--Passive verbs may be easily distinguished from neuter verbs of the same form, by a reference to the agent or instrument, common to the former class, but not to the latter. This frequently is, and always may be, expressed after <i>passive</i> verbs; but never is, and never can be, expressed after <i>neuter</i> verbs: as, "The thief has been caught <i>by the officer</i>."-- "Pens are made <i>with a knife</i>." Here the verbs are passive; but, "<i>I am not</i> yet ascended<i>," (John, xx, 17,) is not passive, because it does not convey</i> the idea of being ascended <i>by</i> some one's agency.</p>
<p>OBS. 4.--Our ancient writers, after the manner of the French, very frequently employed this mode of conjugation in a neuter sense; but, with a very few exceptions, present usage is clearly in favour of the auxiliary <i>have</i> in preference to <i>be</i>, whenever the verb formed with the perfect participle is not passive; as, "They <i>have</i> arrived,"--not, "They <i>are</i> arrived." Hence such examples as the following, are not now good English: "All these reasons <i>are</i> now ceased."--<i>Butler's Analogy</i>, p. 157. Say, "<i>have now</i> ceased." "Whether he <i>were</i> not got beyond the reach of his faculties."--<i>Ib.</i>, p. 158. Say, "<i>had</i> not got." "Which <i>is</i> now grown wholly obsolete."--<i>Churchill's Gram.</i>, p. 330. Say, "<i>has</i> now grown." "And when he <i>was</i> entered into a ship."--<i>Bible</i>. Say, "<i>had</i> entered."-- "What <i>is</i> become of decency and virtue?"--<i>Murray's Key</i>, p. 196. Say, "<i>has</i> become."</p>
<p>OBS. 5.--Dr. Priestley says, "It seems <i>not to have been determined</i> by the English grammarians, whether the <i>passive</i> participles of verbs neuter require the auxiliary <i>am</i> or <i>have</i> before them. The French, in this case, confine themselves strictly to the former. 'What <i>has become</i> of national liberty?' Hume's History, Vol. 6. p. 254. The French would say, <i>what is</i> become<i>; and, in this instance, perhaps, with more propriety."--</i> <i>Priestley's Gram.</i>, p. 128. It is no marvel that those writers who have not rightly made up their minds upon this point of English grammar, should consequently fall into many mistakes. The perfect participle of a neuter verb is not "<i>passive</i>," as the doctor seems to suppose it to be; and the mode of conjugation which he here inclines to prefer, is a mere <i>Gallicism</i>, which is fast wearing out from our language, and is even now but little countenanced by good writers.</p>
<p>OBS. 6.--There are a few verbs of the passive form which seem to imply that a person's own mind is the agent that actuates him; as, "The editor <i>is</i> rejoiced <i>to think," &amp;c.--</i>Juvenile Keepsake<i>. "I</i> am resolved <i>what to</i> do."--<i>Luke</i>, xvi, 4. "He <i>was resolved</i> on going to the city to reside."--<i>Comly's Gram.</i>, p. 114. "James <i>was resolved</i> not to indulge himself."--<i>Murray's Key</i>, ii, 220. "He <i>is inclined</i> to go."--"He <i>is</i> determined <i>to go."--"He</i> is bent <i>on going." These are properly passive</i> verbs, notwithstanding there are active forms which are nearly equivalent to most of them; as, "The editor <i>rejoices</i> to think."--"I <i>know</i> what to do."--"He <i>had resolved</i> on going."--"James <i>resolved</i> not to indulge himself." So in the phrase, "I <i>am ashamed</i> to beg," we seem to have a passive verb of this sort; but, the verb <i>to ashame</i> being now obsolete, <i>ashamed</i> is commonly reckoned an <i>adjective</i>. Yet we cannot put it before a noun, after the usual manner of adjectives. <i>To be indebted</i>, is an other expression of the same kind. In the following example, "<i>am remember'd</i>" is used for <i>do remember</i>, and, in my opinion, <i>inaccurately</i>:</p>
<pre>  "He said mine eyes were black, and my hair black;
   And, now I <i>am remember'd</i>, scorn'd at me."--<i>Shakspeare</i>.

IV. FORM OF NEGATION.</p>

<p><br>
OBSERVATIONS.</p>
<p>OBS. 1.--In a familiar question or negation, the compound or auxiliary form of the verb is, in general, preferable to the simple: as, "No man lives to purpose, who <i>does not live</i> for posterity."--<i>Dr. Wayland</i>. It is indeed so much more common, as to seem the only proper mode of expression: as, "<i>Do I say</i> these things as a man?"--"<i>Do you think</i> that we excuse ourselves?"--"<i>Do you not know</i> that a little leaven <i>leavens</i> the whole lump?"--"<i>Dost thou revile?</i>" &amp;c. But in the solemn or the poetic style, though either may be used, the simple form is more dignified, and perhaps more graceful: as, "<i>Say I</i> these things as a man?"--<i>1 Cor.</i>, ix, 8. "<i>Think ye</i> that we excuse ourselves?"--<i>2 Cor.</i>, xii, 19. "<i>Know ye not</i> that a little leaven <i>leaveneth</i> the whole lump?"--<i>1 Cor.</i>, v, 6. "<i>Revilest thou</i> God's high priest?"--<i>Acts</i>. "King Agrippa, <i>believest</i> thou <i>the prophets?"--</i>Ib. <i>"</i>Understandest thou <i>what thou</i> readest?"--<i>Ib.</i> "Of whom <i>speaketh</i> the prophet this?"--<i>Id.</i> "And the man of God said, Where <i>fell it?</i>"--<i>2 Kings</i>, vi, 6.</p>
<pre>  "What! <i>heard ye not</i> of lowland war?"--<i>Sir W. Scott, L. L.</i>
</pre>
<pre>   "<i>Seems he not</i>, Malise, like a ghost?"--<i>Id., L. of Lake</i>.
</pre>
<pre>   "Where <i>thinkst thou</i> he is now? <i>Stands he</i>, or <i>sits he?</i>
   Or <i>does he walk?</i> or <i>is he</i> on his horse?"--<i>Shak., Ant. and Cleop.</i>
</pre>
<p>OBS. 2.--In interrogative sentences, the auxiliaries <i>shall</i> and <i>will</i> are not always capable of being applied to the different persons agreeably to their use in simple declarations: thus, "<i>Will</i> I go?" is a question which there never can be any occasion to ask in its literal sense; because none knows better than I, what my will or wish is. But "<i>Shall</i> I go?" may properly be asked; because <i>shall</i> here refers to <i>duty</i>, and asks to know what is agreeable to the will of an other. In questions, the first person generally requires <i>shall</i>; the second, <i>will</i>; the third admits of both: but, in the second-future, the third, used interrogatively, seems to require <i>will</i> only. Yet, in that figurative kind of interrogation which is sometimes used to declare a negative, there may be occasional exceptions to these principles; as, "<i>Will I eat</i> the flesh of bulls, or drink the blood of goats?"--<i>Psalms</i>, 1, 13. That is, <i>I will not eat</i>, &amp;c.</p>
<p>OBS. 3.--<i>Cannot</i> is not properly one word, but two: in parsing, the adverb must be taken separately, and the auxiliary be explained with its principal. When power is denied, <i>can</i> and <i>not</i> are now <i>generally</i> united<i>--perhaps in order to prevent ambiguity; as, "I</i> cannot <i>go." But</i> when the power is affirmed, and something else is denied, the words are written separately; as, "The Christian apologist <i>can not merely</i> expose the utter baseness of the infidel assertion, but he has positive ground for erecting an opposite and confronting assertion in its place."--<i>Dr.</i> Chalmers. <i>The junction of these terms, however, is not of much importance</i> to the sense; and, as it is plainly contrary to analogy, some writers,--(as Dr. Webster, in his late or "improved" works; Dr. Bullions, in his; Prof. W. C. Fowler, in his new "English Grammar," 8vo; R. C. Trench, in his "Study of Words;" T. S. Pinneo, in his "revised" grammars; J. R. Chandler, W. S. Cardell, O. B. Peirce,--) always separate them. And, indeed, why should we write, "I <i>cannot</i> go, Thou <i>canst not</i> go, He <i>cannot</i> go?" Apart from the custom, we have just as good reason to join <i>not</i> to <i>canst</i> as to <i>can</i>; and sometimes its union with the latter is a gross error: as, "He <i>cannot only</i> make a way to escape, but with the injunction to duty can infuse the power to perform."--<i>Maturin's Sermons</i>, p. 287. The fear of ambiguity never prevents us from disjoining <i>can</i> and <i>not</i> whenever we wish to put a word between them: as, "Though the waves thereof toss themselves, yet <i>can</i> they <i>not</i> prevail; though they roar, yet <i>can</i> they <i>not</i> pass over it."--<i>Jeremiah</i>, v, 22. "Which then I <i>can</i> resist <i>not</i>."--<i>Byron's Manfred</i>, p. 1.</p>
<pre>  "<i>Can</i> I <i>not</i> mountain maiden spy,
   But she must bear the Douglas eye?"--<i>Scott</i>.
</pre>
<p>OBS. 4.--In negative questions, the adverb <i>not</i> is sometimes placed before the nominative, and sometimes after it: as, "Told <i>not I</i> thee?"--<i>Numb.</i>, xxiii, 26. "Spake <i>I not</i> also to thy messengers?"--<i>Ib.</i>, xxiv, 12. "<i>Cannot I</i> do with you as this potter?"--<i>Jer.</i>, xviii, 6. "Art <i>not thou</i> a seer?"--<i>2 Sam.</i>, xv, 27. "Did <i>not Israel</i> know?"--<i>Rom.</i>, x, 19. "Have <i>they not</i> heard?"--<i>Ib.</i>, 18. "Do <i>not they</i> blaspheme that worthy name?"--<i>James</i>, ii, 7. This adverb, like every other, should be placed where it will sound most agreeably, and best suit the sense. Dr. Priestley imagined that it could not properly come before the nominative. He says, "When the nominative case is put after the verb, on account of <i>an</i> interrogation, <i>no other word</i> should be interposed between them. [EXAMPLES:] 'May <i>not we</i> here say with Lucretius?'--Addison on Medals, p. 29. May <i>we not</i> say? 'Is <i>not it</i> he.' [?] Smollett's Voltaire, Vol 18, p. 152. Is <i>it not</i> he. [?]"--<i>Priestley's Gram.</i>, p. 177.</p>
<p>OBS. 5.--In grave discourse, or in oratory, the adverb <i>not</i> is spoken as distinctly as other words; but, <i>ordinarily</i>, when placed before the nominative, it is rapidly slurred over in utterance and the <i>o</i> is not heard. In fact, it is <i>generally</i> (though inelegantly) contracted in familiar conversation, and joined to the auxiliary: as, IND. Don't they do it? Didn't they do it? Haven't they done it? Hadn't they done it? Shan't, <i>or</i> won't they do it? Won't they have done it? POT. Mayn't, can't, <i>or</i> mustn't they do it? Mightn't, couldn't, wouldn't, <i>or</i> shouldn't they do it? Mayn't, can't, <i>or</i> mustn't they have done it? Mightn't, couldn't, wouldn't, <i>or</i> shouldn't they have done it?</p>
<p>OBS. 6.--Well-educated people commonly utter their words with more distinctness and fullness than the vulgar, yet without adopting ordinarily the long-drawn syllables of poets and orators, or the solemn phraseology of preachers and prophets. Whatever may be thought of the grammatical propriety of such contractions as the foregoing, no one who has ever observed how the English language is usually spoken, will doubt their commonness, or their antiquity. And it may be observed, that, in the use of these forms, the distinction of persons and numbers in the verb, is almost, if not entirely, dropped. Thus <i>don't</i> is used for <i>dost not</i> or <i>does</i> not<i>, as properly as for</i> do not<i>; and, "</i>Thou can't <i>do it, or</i> shan't <i>do</i> it," is as good English as, "<i>He can't</i> do it, or <i>shan't</i> do it." <i>Will</i>, according to Webster, was anciently written <i>woll</i>: hence <i>won't</i> acquired the <i>o</i>, which is long in Walker's orthoëpy. <i>Haven't</i>, which cannot be used for <i>has not</i> or <i>hast not</i>, is still further contracted by the vulgar, and spoken <i>ha'nt</i>, which serves for all three. These forms are sometimes found in books; as, "WONT, a contraction of <i>woll not</i>, that is, <i>will not</i>."--<i>Webster's Dict.</i> "HA'NT, a contraction of <i>have not</i> or <i>has</i> not<i>."--</i>Id. <i>"WONT, (w=ont</i> or <i>w~unt,) A contraction of</i> would not<i>:--</i> used for <i>will</i> not."--<i>Worcester's Dict.</i> "HAN'T, (hänt or h=ant,) A vulgar contraction for <i>has not</i>, or <i>have not</i>."--<i>Id.</i> In the writing of such contractions, the apostrophe is not always used; though some think it necessary for distinction's sake: as, "Which is equivalent, because what <i>can't</i> be done <i>won't</i> be done."--<i>Johnson's Gram. Com.</i>, p. 312.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>IRREGULAR VERBS.</p>
<p>An <i>irregular verb</i> is a verb that does not form the preterit and the perfect participle by assuming <i>d</i> or <i>ed</i>; as, <i>see, saw, seeing, seen</i>. Of this class of verbs there are about one hundred and ten, beside their several derivatives and compounds.</p>

<p>OBS. 1.--Regular verbs form their preterits and perfect participles, by adding <i>d</i> to final <i>e</i>, and <i>ed</i> to all other terminations; the final consonant of the verb being sometimes doubled, (as in <i>dropped</i>,) and final <i>y</i> sometimes changed into <i>i</i>, (as in <i>cried</i>,) agreeably to the rules for spelling in such cases. The verb <i>hear, heard, hearing, heard</i>, adds <i>d</i> to <i>r</i>, and is therefore irregular. <i>Heard</i> is pronounced <i>h~erd</i> by all our lexicographers, except <i>Webster</i>: who formerly wrote it <i>heerd</i>, and still pronounces it so; alleging, in despite of universal usage against him, that it is written "more correctly <i>heared</i>."--<i>Octavo Dict.</i>, 1829. Such pronunciation would doubtless require this last orthography, "<i>heared</i>;" but both are, in fact, about as fanciful as his former mode of spelling, which ran thus: "<i>Az</i> I had <i>heerd</i> suggested by <i>frends</i> or indifferent <i>reeders</i>."--<i>Dr. Webster's Essays, Preface</i>, p. 10.</p>
<p>OBS. 2.--When a verb ends in a sharp consonant, <i>t</i> is sometimes improperly substituted for <i>ed</i>, making the preterit and the perfect participle irregular in spelling, when they are not so in sound; as, <i>distrest</i> for <i>distressed, tost</i> for <i>tossed, mixt</i> for <i>mixed, cract</i> for <i>cracked</i>. These contractions are now generally treated as <i>errors</i> in writing; and the verbs are accordingly (with a few exceptions) accounted regular. Lord Kames commends Dean Swift for having done "all in his power to restore the syllable <i>ed</i>;" says, he "possessed, if any man ever did, the true genius of the English tongue;" and thinks that in rejecting these ugly contractions, "he well deserves to be imitated."--<i>Elements of Criticism</i>, Vol. ii, p. 12. The regular orthography is indeed to be preferred in all such cases; but the writing of <i>ed</i> restores no syllable, except in solemn discourse; and, after all, the poems of Swift have so very many of these irregular contractions in <i>t</i>, that one can hardly believe his lordship had ever read them. Since the days of these critics still more has been done towards the restoration of the <i>ed</i>, in orthography, though not in sound; but, even at this present time, our poets not unfrequently write, <i>est</i> for <i>essed</i> or <i>ess'd</i>, in forming the preterits or participles of verbs that end in the syllable <i>ess</i>. This is an ill practice, which needlessly multiplies our redundant verbs, and greatly embarrasses what it seems at first to simplify: as,</p>
<pre>  "O friend! I know not which way I must look
   For comfort, being, as I am, <i>opprest</i>,
   To think that now our life is only <i>drest</i>
   For show."--<i>Wordsworth's Poetical Works</i>, 8vo, p. 119.
</pre>
<p>OBS. 3.--When the verb ends with a smooth consonant, the substitution of <i>t</i> for <i>ed</i> produces an irregularity in sound as well as in writing. In some such irregularities, the poets are indulged for the sake of rhyme; but the best speakers and writers of prose prefer the regular form, wherever good use has sanctioned it: thus <i>learned</i> is better than <i>learnt; burned</i>, than <i>burnt; penned</i>, than <i>pent; absorbed</i>, than <i>absorbt; spelled</i>, than <i>spelt; smelled</i>, than <i>smelt</i>. So many of this sort of words as are allowably contracted, belong to the class of redundant verbs, among which they may be seen in a subsequent table.</p>
<p>OBS. 4.--Several of the irregular verbs are variously used by the best authors; redundant forms are occasionally given to some verbs, without sufficient authority; and many preterits and participles which were formerly in good use, are now obsolete, or becoming so. The <i>simple</i> irregular verbs in English are about one hundred and ten, and they are nearly all monosyllables. They are derived from the Saxon, in which language they are also, for the most part, irregular.</p>
<p>OBS. 5.--The following alphabetical list exhibits the simple irregular verbs, as they are <i>now generally</i> used. In this list, those preterits and participles which are supposed to be preferable, and best supported by authorities, are placed first. Nearly all compounds that follow the form of their simple verbs, or derivatives that follow their primitives, are here purposely omitted. <i>Welcome</i> and <i>behave</i> are always regular, and therefore belong not here. Some words which are obsolete, have also been omitted, that the learner might not mistake them for words in present use. Some of those which are placed last, are now little used.</p>

<p><br>
REDUNDANT VERBS.</p>
<p>A <i>redundant verb</i> is a verb that forms the preterit or the perfect participle in two or more ways, and so as to be both regular and irregular; as, <i>thrive, thrived</i> or <i>throve, thriving, thrived</i> or <i>thriven</i>. Of this class of verbs, there are about ninety-five, beside sundry derivatives and compounds.</p>
<p><br>
OBSERVATIONS.</p>
<p>OBS. 1.--Those irregular verbs which have more than one form for the preterit or for the perfect participle, are in some sense redundant; but, as there is no occasion to make a distinct class of such as have double forms that are never regular, these redundancies are either included in the preceding list of the simple irregular verbs, or omitted as being improper to be now recognized for good English. Several examples of the latter kind, including both innovations and archaisms, will appear among the improprieties for correction, at the end of this chapter. A few old preterits or participles may perhaps be accounted good English in the solemn style, which are not so in the familiar: as, "And none <i>spake</i> a word unto him."--<i>Job</i>, ii, 13. "When I <i>brake</i> the five loaves."--<i>Mark</i>, viii, 19. "And he <i>drave</i> them from the judgement-seat."--<i>Acts</i>, xviii, 16. "Serve me till I have eaten and <i>drunken</i>."--<i>Luke</i>, xvii, 8. "It was not possible that he should be <i>holden</i> of it."--<i>Acts</i>, ii, 24. "Thou <i>castedst</i> them down into destruction."--<i>Psal.</i>, lxxiii, 18. "Behold, I was <i>shapen</i> in iniquity."--<i>Ib.</i>, li, 5. "A meat-offering <i>baken</i> in the oven."--<i>Leviticus</i>, ii, 4.</p>
<pre>  "With <i>casted</i> slough, and fresh celerity."--SHAK., <i>Henry V</i>.
</pre>
<pre>   "Thy dreadful vow, <i>loaden</i> with death."--ADDISON: <i>in Joh. Dict.</i>
</pre>
<p>OBS. 2.--The verb <i>bet</i> is given in Worcester's Dictionary, as being always regular: "BET, <i>v. a.</i> [<i>i</i>. BETTED; <i>pp</i>. BETTING, BETTED.] To wager; to lay a wager or bet. SHAK."--<i>Octavo Dict.</i> In Ainsworth's Grammar, it is given as being always irregular: "<i>Present</i>, Bet; <i>Imperfect</i>, Bet; <i>Participle</i>, Bet."--Page 36. On the authority of these, and of some others cited in OBS. 6th below, I have put it with the redundant verbs. The verb <i>prove</i> is redundant, if <i>proven</i>, which is noticed by Webster, Bolles, and Worcester, is an admissible word. "The participle <i>proven</i> is used in Scotland and in some parts of the United States, and sometimes, though rarely, in England.--'There is a mighty difference between <i>not proven</i> and <i>disproven</i>.' DR. TH. CHALMERS. 'Not <i>proven</i>.' QU. REV."--<i>Worcester's</i> Universal and Critical Dict. <i>The verbs</i> bless <i>and</i> dress <i>are to be</i> considered redundant, according to the authority of Worcester, Webster, Bolles, and others. Cobbett will have the verbs, <i>cast, chide, cling, draw,</i> grow, shred, sling, slink, spring, sting, stride, swim, swing<i>, and</i> <i>thrust</i>, to be always regular; but I find no sufficient authority for allowing to any of them a regular form; and therefore leave them, where they always have been, in the list of simple irregulars. These fourteen verbs are a part of the long list of <i>seventy</i> which this author says, "are, by some persons, <i>erroneously</i> deemed irregular." Of the following <i>nine</i> only, is his assertion true; namely, <i>dip, help, load, overflow,</i> slip, snow, stamp, strip, whip<i>. These nine ought always to be formed</i> regularly; for all their irregularities may well be reckoned obsolete. After these deductions from this most erroneous catalogue, there remain forty-five other very common verbs, to be disposed of contrary to this author's instructions. All but two of these I shall place in the list of <i>redundant</i> verbs; though for the use of <i>throwed</i> I find no written authority but his and William B. Fowle's. The two which I do not consider redundant are <i>spit</i> and <i>strew</i>, of which it may be proper to take more particular notice.</p>
<p>OBS. 3.--<i>Spit</i>, to stab, or to put upon a spit, is regular; as, "I <i>spitted frogs</i>, I crushed a heap of emmets."--<i>Dryden. Spit</i>, to throw out saliva, is irregular, and most properly formed thus: <i>spit, spit, spitting,</i> spit. "Spat <i>is obsolete."--</i>Webster's Dict. <i>It is used in the Bible; as,</i> "He <i>spat</i> on the ground, and made clay of the spittle."--<i>John</i>, ix, 6. L. Murray gives this verb thus: "Pres. <i>Spit</i>; Imp. <i>spit, spat</i>; Perf. Part. <i>spit, spitten</i>." NOTE: "<i>Spitten</i> is nearly obsolete."--<i>Octavo Gram.</i>, p. 106. Sanborn has it thus: "Pres. <i>Spit</i>; Imp. <i>spit</i>; Pres. Part. <i>spitting</i>; Perf. Part. <i>spit, spat</i>."--<i>Analytical Gram.</i>, p. 48. Cobbett, at first, taking it in the form, "to <i>spit</i>, I <i>spat, spitten</i>," placed it among the seventy which he so erroneously thought should be made regular; afterwards he left it only in his list of irregulars, thus: "to <i>spit</i>, I <i>spit, spitten</i>."--<i>Cobbett's E. Gram.</i>, of 1832, p. 54. Churchill, in 1823, preferring the older forms, gave it thus: "<i>Spit, spat</i> or <i>spit,</i> spitten <i>or</i> spit<i>."--</i>New Gram.<i>, p. 111. NOTE:--"Johnson gives</i> spat <i>as</i> the preterimperfect, and <i>spit</i> or <i>spitted</i> as the participle of this verb, when it means to pierce through with a pointed instrument: but in this sense, I believe, it is always regular; while, on the other hand, the regular form is now never used, when it signifies to eject from the mouth; though we find in <i>Luke</i>, xviii, 32, 'He shall be <i>spitted</i> on.'"--<i>Churchill's New Gram.</i>, p. 264. This text ought to have been, "He shall be <i>spit</i> upon."</p>
<p>OBS. 4.--<i>To strew</i> is in fact nothing else than an other mode of spelling the verb <i>to strow</i>; as <i>shew</i> is an obsolete form for <i>show</i>; but if we pronounce the two forms differently, we make them different words. Walker, and some others, pronounce them alike, <i>stro</i>; Sheridan, Jones, Jameson, and Webster, distinguish them in utterance, <i>stroo</i> and <i>stro</i>. This is convenient for the sake of rhyme, and perhaps therefore preferable. But <i>strew</i>, I incline to think, is properly a regular verb only, though Wells and Worcester give it otherwise: if <i>strewn</i> has ever been proper, it seems now to be obsolete. EXAMPLES: "Others cut down branches from the trees, and <i>strewed</i> them in the way."--<i>Matt.</i>, xxi, 8. "Gathering where thou hast not <i>strewed</i>."--<i>Matt.</i>, xxv, 24.</p>
<pre>  "Their name, their years, <i>spelt</i> by th' unletter'd <i>muse</i>,
   The place of fame and elegy supply;
   And many <i>a holy text</i> around she <i>strews</i>,
   <i>That teach</i> the rustic moralist to die."--<i>Gray</i>.
</pre>
<p>OBS. 5.--The list which I give below, prepared with great care, exhibits the redundant verbs, as they are now generally used, or as they may be used without grammatical impropriety.[291] Those forms which are supposed to be preferable, and best supported by authorities, are placed first. No words are inserted here, but such as some modern authors countenance. L. Murray recognizes <i>bereaved, catched, dealed, digged, dwelled, hanged, knitted,</i> shined, spilled<i>; and, in his early editions, he approved of</i> bended, builded, creeped, weaved, worked, wringed<i>. His two larger books now tell</i> us, "The Compiler <i>has not inserted</i> such verbs as <i>learnt, spelt, spilt</i>, &amp;c. which are improperly terminated by <i>t</i>, instead of <i>ed</i>."--<i>Octavo</i> Gram.<i>, p. 107;</i> Duodecimo<i>, p. 97. But if he did not, in all his grammars,</i> insert, "<i>Spill, spilt</i>, R. <i>spilt</i>, R.," (pp. 106, 96,) preferring the irregular form to the regular, somebody else has done it for him. And, what is remarkable, many of his <i>amenders</i>, as if misled by some evil genius, have contradicted themselves in precisely the same way! Ingersoll, Fisk, Merchant, and Hart, republish exactly the foregoing words, and severally become "<i>The Compiler</i>" of the same erroneous catalogue! Kirkham prefers <i>spilt</i> to <i>spilled</i>, and then declares the word to be "<i>improperly</i> terminated by <i>t</i> instead of <i>ed</i>."--<i>Gram.</i>, p. 151. Greenleaf, who condemns <i>learnt</i> and <i>spelt</i>, thinks <i>dwelt</i> and <i>spilt</i> are "the <i>only</i> established <i>forms;" yet he will have</i> dwell <i>and</i> spill <i>to be "</i>regular<i>"</i> verbs, as well as "<i>irregular!</i>"--<i>Gram. Simp.</i>, p. 29. Webber prefers <i>spilled</i> to <i>spilt</i>; but Picket admits only the latter. Cobbett and Sanborn prefer <i>bereaved, builded, dealed, digged, dreamed, hanged</i>, and <i>knitted</i>, to <i>bereft, built, dealt, dug, dreamt, hung</i>, and <i>knit</i>. The former prefers <i>creeped</i> to <i>crept</i>, and <i>freezed</i> to <i>froze</i>; the latter, <i>slitted</i> to <i>slit, wringed</i> to <i>wrung</i>; and both consider, "<i>I bended</i>," "<i>I bursted</i>" and "<i>I blowed</i>," to be good modern English. W. Allen acknowledges <i>freezed</i> and <i>slided</i>; and, like Webster, prefers <i>hove</i> to <i>hoven</i>: but the latter justly prefers <i>heaved</i> to both. EXAMP.: "The supple kinsman <i>slided</i> to the helm."--<i>New Timon</i>. "The rogues <i>slided</i> me into the river."--<i>Shak</i>. "And the sand <i>slided</i> from beneath my feet."-- DR. JOHNSON: <i>in Murray's Sequel</i>, p. 179. "Wherewith she <i>freez'd</i> her foes to congeal'd stone."--<i>Milton's Comus</i>, l. 449. "It <i>freezed</i> hard last night. Now, what was it that <i>freezed</i> so hard?"--<i>Emmons's Gram.</i>, p. 25. "Far hence lies, ever <i>freez'd</i>, the northern main."--<i>Savage's</i> Wanderer<i>, l. 57. "Has he not taught,</i> beseeched<i>, and shed abroad the</i> Spirit unconfined?"--<i>Pollok's Course of Time</i>, B. x, l. 275.</p>
<p>OBS. 6.--D. Blair supposes <i>catched</i> to be an "erroneous" word and unauthorized: "I <i>catch'd</i> it," for "I <i>caught</i> it," he sets down for a "<i>vulgarism</i>."--<i>E. Gram.</i>, p. 111. But <i>catched</i> is used by some of the most celebrated authors. Dearborn prefers the regular form of <i>creep</i>: "creep, creeped <i>or</i> crept, creeped <i>or</i> crept."--<i>Columbian Gram.</i>, p. 38. I adopt no man's opinions implicitly; copy nothing without examination; but, <i>to prove all my decisions to be right</i>, would be an endless task. I shall do as much as ought to be expected, toward showing that they are so. It is to be remembered, that the <i>poets</i>, as well as the <i>vulgar</i>, use some forms which a <i>gentleman</i> would be likely to avoid, unless he meant to quote or imitate; as,</p>
<pre>  "So <i>clomb</i> the first grand thief into God's fold;
   So since into his church lewd hirelings climb."
       --<i>Milton, P. L.</i>, B. iv, l. 192.

</pre>

<p>OBS. 8.--<i>Layed, payed</i>, and <i>stayed</i>, are now less common than <i>laid,</i> paid<i>, and</i> staid<i>; but perhaps not less correct, since they are the same</i> words in a more regular and not uncommon orthography: "Thou takest up that [which] thou <i>layedst</i> not down."--FRIENDS' BIBLE, SMITH'S, BRUCE'S: <i>Luke</i>, xix, 21. Scott's Bible, in this place, has "<i>layest</i>," which is wrong in tense. "Thou <i>layedst</i> affliction upon our loins."--FRIENDS' BIBLE: <i>Psalms</i>, lxvi, 11. "Thou <i>laidest</i> affliction upon our loins."--SCOTT'S BIBLE, <i>and</i> BRUCE'S. "Thou <i>laidst</i> affliction upon our loins."--SMITH'S BIBLE, Stereotyped by J. Howe.

<p>OBS. 9.--By the foregoing citations, <i>lay, pay</i>, and <i>stay</i>, are clearly proved to be redundant. But, in nearly all our English grammars, <i>lay</i> and <i>pay</i> are represented as being always irregular; and <i>stay</i> is as often, and as improperly, supposed to be always regular.

<p>OBS. 10.--The verb to <i>shake</i> is now seldom used in any other than the irregular form, <i>shake, shook, shaking, shaken</i>; and, in this form only, is it recognized by our principal grammarians and lexicographers, except that Johnson improperly acknowledges <i>shook</i> as well as <i>shaken</i> for the perfect participle: as, "I've <i>shook</i> it off."--DRYDEN: <i>Joh. Dict.</i> But the regular form, <i>shake, shaked, shaking, shaked</i>, appears to have been used by some writers of high reputation; and, if the verb is not now properly redundant, it formerly was so. Examples regular: "The frame and huge foundation of the earth <i>shak'd</i> like a coward."--SHAKSPEARE: <i>Hen. IV</i>. "I am he that is so <i>love-shaked</i>."--ID.: <i>As You Like it</i>. "A sly and constant knave, not to be <i>shak'd</i>."--ID.: <i>Cymbeline: Joh. Dict.</i> "I thought he would have <i>shaked</i> it off."--TATTLER: <i>ib.</i> "To the very point I <i>shaked</i> my head at."--<i>Spectator</i>, No. 4. "From the ruin'd roof of <i>shak'd</i> Olympus."--<i>Milton's Poems</i>. "None hath <i>shak'd</i> it off."--<i>Walker's English Particles</i>, p. 89. "They <i>shaked</i> their heads."--<i>Psalms</i>, cix, 25. Dr. Crombie says, "Story, in his Grammar, has, <i>most unwarrantably</i>, asserted, that the Participle of this Verb should be <i>shaked</i>."--ON ETYMOLOGY AND SYNTAX, p. 198. Fowle, on the contrary, pronounces <i>shaked</i> to be right. See <i>True English Gram.</i>, p. 46.</p>
<p>OBS. 11.--All former lists of our irregular and redundant verbs are, in many respects, defective and erroneous; nor is it claimed for those which are here presented, that they are absolutely perfect. I trust, however, they are much nearer to perfection, than are any earlier ones. Among the many individuals who have published schemes of these verbs, none have been more respected and followed than Lowth, Murray, and Crombie; yet are these authors' lists severally faulty in respect to as many as sixty or seventy of the words in question, though the whole number but little exceeds two hundred, and is commonly reckoned less than one hundred and eighty. By Lowth, eight verbs are made redundant, which I think are now regular only: namely, <i>bake, climb, fold, help, load, owe, wash</i>. By Crombie, as many: to wit, <i>bake, climb, freight, help, lift, load, shape, writhe</i>. By Murray, two: <i>load</i> and <i>shape</i>. With Crombie, and in general with the others too, twenty-seven verbs are always irregular, which I think are sometimes regular, and therefore redundant: <i>abide, beseech, blow, burst, creep,</i> freeze, grind, lade, lay, pay, rive, seethe, shake, show, sleep, slide, speed, string, strive, strow, sweat, thrive, throw, weave, weep, wind, wring<i>. Again, there are, I think, more than twenty redundant verbs which</i> are treated by Crombie,--and, with one or two exceptions, by Lowth and Murray also,--as if they were always regular: namely, <i>betide, blend,</i> bless, burn, dive, dream, dress, geld, kneel, lean, leap, learn, mean, mulct, pass, pen, plead, prove, reave, smell, spell, stave, stay, sweep, wake, whet, wont<i>. Crombie's list contains the auxiliaries, which properly</i> belong to a different table. Erroneous as it is, in all these things, and more, it is introduced by the author with the following praise, in bad English: "<i>Verbs, which</i> depart from this rule, are called Irregular, <i>of</i> which <i>I believe the subsequent enumeration to be</i> nearly complete<i>."--TREATISE ON ETYM. AND SYNT., p. 192.</i></p>
<p>OBS. 12.--Dr. Johnson, in his Grammar of the English Tongue, recognizes two forms which would make <i>teach</i> and <i>reach</i> redundant. But <i>teached</i> is now "obsolete," and <i>rought</i> is "old," according to his own Dictionary. Of <i>loaded</i> and <i>loaden</i>, which he gives as participles of <i>load</i>, the regular form only appears to be now in good use. For the redundant forms of many words in the foregoing list, as of <i>abode</i> or <i>abided, awaked</i> or <i>awoke,</i> besought <i>or</i> beseeched, caught <i>or</i> catched, hewed <i>or</i> hewn, mowed <i>or</i> <i>mown, laded</i> or <i>laden, seethed</i> or <i>sod, sheared</i> or <i>shore, sowed</i> or <i>sown, waked</i> or <i>woke, wove</i> or <i>weaved</i>, his authority may be added to that of others already cited. In Dearborn's Columbian Grammar, published in Boston in 1795, the year in which Lindley Murray's Grammar first appeared in York, no fewer than thirty verbs are made redundant, which are not so represented by Murray. Of these I have retained nineteen in the following list, and left the other eleven to be now considered always regular. The thirty are these: "bake, <i>bend, build, burn</i>, climb, <i>creep, dream</i>, fold, freight, <i>geld, heat, heave</i>, help, <i>lay, leap</i>, lift, <i>light</i>, melt, owe, <i>quit</i>, rent, rot, <i>seethe, spell, split, strive</i>, wash, <i>weave, wet,</i> work<i>." See</i> Dearborn's Gram.<i>, p. 37-45.</i></p>

<p><br>
DEFECTIVE VERBS.</p>
<p>A <i>defective verb</i> is a verb that forms no participles, and is used in but few of the moods and tenses; as, <i>beware, ought, quoth</i>.</p>
<p><br>
OBSERVATIONS.</p>
<p>OBS. 1. When any of the principal parts of a verb are wanting, the tenses usually derived from those parts are also, of course, wanting. All the auxiliaries, except <i>do, be</i>, and <i>have</i>, if we compare them with other verbs, are defective; but, <i>as auxiliaries</i>, they lack nothing; for no complete verb is used throughout as an auxiliary, except <i>be</i>. And since an auxiliary differs essentially from a principal verb, the propriety of referring <i>may, can, must</i>, and <i>shall</i>, to the class of defective verbs, is at least questionable. In parsing there is never any occasion to <i>call</i> them defective verbs, because they are always taken together with their principals. And though we may technically say, that their participles are "<i>wanting</i>," it is manifest that none are <i>needed</i>.</p>
<p>OBS. 2. <i>Will</i> is sometimes used as a principal verb, and as such it is regular and complete; <i>will, willed, willing, willed</i>: as, "His Majesty <i>willed</i> that they should attend."--<i>Clarendon</i>. "He <i>wills</i> for them a happiness of a far more exalted and enduring nature."--<i>Gurney</i>. "Whether thou <i>willest</i> it to be a minister to our pleasure."--<i>Harris</i>. "I <i>will</i>; be thou clean."--<i>Luke</i>, v, 13. "Nevertheless, not as I <i>will</i>, but as thou <i>will</i>."--<i>Matt.</i>, xxvi, 39. "To <i>will</i> is present with me."--<i>Rom.</i>, vii, 18. But <i>would</i> is sometimes also a principal verb; as, "What <i>would</i> this man?"--<i>Pope</i>. "Would God that all the Lord's people were prophets."--<i>Numb.</i>, xi, 29. "And Israel <i>would</i> none of me."--<i>Psalm</i>, lxxxi, 11. If we refer this indefinite preterit to the same root, <i>will</i> becomes redundant; <i>will, willed</i> or <i>would, willing, willed</i>. In respect to time, <i>would</i> is less definite than <i>willed</i>, though both are called preterits. It is common, and perhaps best, to consider them distinct verbs. The latter only can be a participle: as,</p>
<pre>  "How rarely does it meet with this time's guise,
   When man was <i>will'd</i> to love his enemies!"--<i>Shakspeare</i>.
</pre>
<p>OBS. 3. The remaining defective verbs are only five or six questionable terms, which our grammarians know not well how else to explain; some of them being now nearly obsolete, and others never having been very proper. <i>Begone</i> is a needless coalition of <i>be</i> and <i>gone</i>, better written separately, unless Dr. Johnson is right in calling the compound an <i>interjection</i>: as,</p>
<pre>  "Begone! the goddess cries with stern disdain,
   Begone! nor dare the hallow'd stream to stain!"--<i>Addison</i>.
</pre>
<p><i>Beware</i> also seems to be a needless compound of <i>be</i> and the old adjective <i>ware</i>, wary, aware, cautious. Both these are, of course, used only in those forms of expression in which <i>be</i> is proper; as, "<i>Beware</i> of dogs, <i>beware</i> of evil workers, <i>beware</i> of the concision."--<i>Philippians</i>, iii, 2. "But we <i>must beware</i>[297] of carrying our attention to this beauty too far."--<i>Blair's Rhet.</i>, p. 119. These words were formerly separated: as, "Of whom <i>be</i> thou <i>ware</i> also."--<i>1 Tim.</i>, iv, 15. "They <i>were ware</i> of it."--FRIENDS' BIBLE, and ALGER'S: <i>Acts</i>, xiii, 6. "They were <i>aware</i> of it."--SCOTT'S BIBLE: ib. "And in an hour <i>that</i> he is not <i>ware</i> of him."--<i>Johnson's Dict., w. Ware</i>. "And in an hour that he is not <i>aware</i> of."--COMMON BIBLES: <i>Matt.</i>, xxiv, 50. "Bid her well <i>be ware</i> and still erect."--MILTON: <i>in Johnson's Dict.</i> "That even Silence <i>was took</i> ere she <i>was ware</i>."--<i>Id., Comus</i>, line 558. The adjective <i>ware</i> is now said to be "<i>obsolete</i>;" but the propriety of this assertion depends upon that of forming such a defective verb. What is the use of doing so?</p>
<pre>  "This to disclose is all thy guardian can;
   <i>Beware</i> of all, but most <i>beware</i> of man."--<i>Pope</i>.
</pre>
<p>The words written separately will always have the same meaning, unless we omit the preposition <i>of</i>, and suppose the compound to be a <i>transitive</i> verb. In this case, the argument for compounding the terms appears to be valid; as,</p>
<pre>  "<i>Beware</i> the public <i>laughter</i> of the town;
   Thou springst a-leak already in thy crown."--<i>Dryden</i>.
</pre>
<p>OBS. 4. The words <i>ought</i> and <i>own</i>, without question, were originally parts of the redundant verb <i>to owe</i>; thus: <i>owe, owed</i> or <i>ought, owing,</i> owed <i>or</i> own<i>. But both have long been disjoined from this connexion, and</i> hence <i>owe</i> has become regular. <i>Own</i>, as now used, is either a pronominal adjective, as, "my <i>own</i> hand," or a regular verb thence derived, as, "to <i>own</i> a house." <i>Ought</i>, under the name of a <i>defective verb</i>, is now generally thought to be properly used, in this one form, in all the persons and numbers of the present and the imperfect tense of the indicative and subjunctive moods. Or, if it is really of one tense only, it is plainly an aorist; and hence the time must be specified by the infinitive that follows: as, "He <i>ought</i> to <i>go</i>; He <i>ought</i> to <i>have gone</i>." "If thou <i>ought</i> to <i>go</i>; If thou <i>ought</i> to <i>have gone</i>." Being originally a preterit, it never occurs in the infinitive mood, and is entirely invariable, except in the solemn style, where we find <i>oughtest</i> in both tenses; as, "How thou <i>oughtest</i> to <i>behave</i> thyself."--<i>1 Tim.</i>, iii, 15. "Thou <i>oughtest</i> therefore to <i>have put</i> my money to the exchangers."--<i>Matt.</i>, xxiv, 27. We never say, or have said, "He, she, or it, <i>oughts</i> or <i>oughteth</i>." Yet we manifestly use this verb in the present tense, and in the third person singular; as, "Discourse <i>ought always to</i> begin <i>with a clear proposition."--</i>Blair's Rhet.<i>, p. 217. I have already</i> observed that some grammarians improperly call <i>ought</i> an auxiliary. The learned authors of Brightland's Grammar, (which is dedicated to Queen Anne,) did so; and also affirmed that <i>must</i> and <i>ought</i> "have only the <i>present time</i>," and are alike <i>invariable</i>. "It is <i>now</i> quite obsolete to say, <i>thou oughtest</i>; for <i>ought</i> now changes its ending no more than <i>must</i>."--<i>Brightland's Gram.</i>, (approved by <i>Isaac Bickerstaff, Esq.</i>,) p. 112.</p>
<pre>  "<i>Do, will</i>, and <i>shall, must</i>, OUGHT, and <i>may</i>,
   <i>Have, am</i>, or <i>be</i>, this Doctrine will display."--<i>Ib.</i>, p. 107.
</pre>
<p>OBS. 5.--<i>Wis</i>, preterit <i>wist</i>, to know, to think, to suppose, to imagine, appears to be now nearly or quite obsolete; but it may be proper to explain it, because it is found in the Bible: as, "I <i>wist</i> not, brethren, that he was the high priest."--<i>Acts</i>, xxiii, 5. "He himself '<i>wist</i> not that his face shone.'"--<i>Life of Schiller</i>, p. iv. <i>Wit</i>, to know, and <i>wot</i>, knew, are also obsolete, except in the phrase <i>to wit</i>; which, being taken abstractly, is equivalent to the adverb <i>namely</i>, or to the phrase, <i>that</i> is to say<i>. The phrase, "</i>we do you to wit<i>," (in 2 Cor., viii, 1st,)</i> means, "we <i>inform</i> you." Churchill gives the present tense of this verb three forms, <i>weet, wit</i>, and <i>wot</i>; and there seems to have been some authority for them all: as, "He was, <i>to weet</i>, a little roguish page."--<i>Thomson</i>. "But little <i>wotteth</i> he the might of the means his folly despiseth."--<i>Tupper's Book of Thoughts</i>, p. 35. <i>To wit</i>, used alone, to indicate a thing spoken of, (as the French use their infinitive, <i>savoir, à savoir</i>, or the phrase, <i>c'est à savoir</i>,) is undoubtedly an elliptical expression: probably for, "<i>I give you to wit</i>;" i. e., "I give you <i>to know</i>." <i>Trow</i>, to think, occurs in the Bible; as, "I <i>trow</i> not."--<i>N. Test</i>. And Coar gives it as a defective verb; and only in the first person singular of the present indicative, "<i>I trow</i>." Webster and Worcester mark the words as obsolete; but Sir W. Scott, in the Lady of the Lake, has this line:</p>
<pre>  "Thinkst thou <i>he trow'd</i> thine omen ought?"--<i>Canto</i> iv, stanza 10.
</pre>
<p><i>Quoth</i> and <i>quod</i>, for <i>say, saith</i>, or <i>said</i>, are obsolete, or used only in ludicrous language. Webster supposes these words to be equivalent, and each confined to the first and third persons of the present and imperfect tenses of the indicative mood. Johnson says, that, "<i>quoth you</i>," as used by Sidney, is irregular; but Tooke assures us, that "The <i>th</i> in <i>quoth</i>, does not designate the third person."--<i>Diversions of Purley</i>, Vol. ii, p. 323. They are each invariable, and always placed before the nominative: as, <i>quoth I, quoth he</i>.</p>
<pre>  "Yea, so sayst thou, (<i>quod</i> Tröylus,) alas!"--<i>Chaucer</i>.
</pre>
<pre>   "I feare, <i>quod</i> he, it wyll not be."--<i>Sir T. More</i>.
</pre>
<pre>   "Stranger, go! Heaven be thy guide!
   <i>Quod</i> the beadsman of Nith-side."--<i>Burns</i>.
</pre>
<p>OBS. 6.--<i>Methinks</i>, (i. e., <i>to</i> me <i>it</i> thinks,) for I think, or, it seems to me, with its preterit <i>methought</i>, (i. e., <i>to</i> me <i>it</i> thought,) is called by Dr. Johnson an "ungrammatical word." He imagined it to be "a Norman corruption, the French being apt to confound <i>me</i> and <i>I</i>."--<i>Joh. Dict.</i> It is indeed a puzzling anomaly in our language, though not without some Anglo-Saxon or Latin parallels; and, like its kindred, "me <i>seemeth</i>," or "<i>meseems</i>," is little worthy to be countenanced, though often used by Dryden, Pope, Addison, and other good writers. Our lexicographers call it an <i>impersonal verb</i>, because, being compounded with an objective, it cannot have a nominative expressed. It is nearly equivalent to the adverb <i>apparently</i>; and if impersonal, it is also defective; for it has no participles, no "<i>methinking</i>," and no participial construction of "<i>methought</i>;" though Webster's American Dictionary, whether quarto or octavo, absurdly suggests that the latter word may be used as a participle. In the Bible, we find the following text: "<i>Me</i> thinketh <i>the running of the foremost is like the running of Ahimaaz."--</i>2 Sam.<i>, xviii, 27. And Milton improperly makes</i> thought <i>an impersonal verb,</i> apparently governing the separate objective pronoun <i>him</i>; as,</p>
<pre>  "<i>Him thought</i> he by the brook of Cherith stood."
       --<i>P. R.</i>, B. ii, l. 264.

<p>OBS. 7.--Some verbs from the nature of the subjects to which they refer, are chiefly confined to the third person singular; as, "It <i>rains</i>; it <i>snows</i>; it <i>freezes</i>; it <i>hails</i>; it <i>lightens</i>; it <i>thunders</i>." These have been called <i>impersonal verbs</i>; because the neuter pronoun it, which is commonly used before them, does not seem to represent any noun, but, in connexion with the verb, merely to express a state of things. They are however, in fact, neither impersonal nor defective. Some, or all of them, may possibly take some other nominative, if not a different person; as, "The <i>Lord rained</i> upon Sodom, and upon Gomorrah, brimstone and fire."--<i>Gen.</i>, xix, 24. "The <i>God</i> of glory <i>thundereth</i>."--<i>Psalms</i>, xxix, 3. "<i>Canst thou thunder</i> with a voice like him?"--<i>Job</i>, xl, 9. In short, as Harris observes, "The doctrine of Impersonal Verbs has been justly rejected by the best grammarians, both ancient and modern."--<i>Hermes</i>, p. 175.</p>
<p>OBS. 8.--By some writers, words of this kind are called <i>Monopersonal</i> Verbs<i>; that is, verbs of</i> one person<i>. This name, though not very properly</i> compounded, is perhaps more fit than the other; but we have little occasion to speak of these verbs as a distinct class in our language. Dr. Murray says, "What is called an impersonal verb, is not so; for <i>lic-et, juv-at</i>, and <i>oport-et</i>, have <i>Tha, that thing</i>, or <i>it</i>, in their composition."--<i>History of European Languages</i>, Vol. ii, p. 146. <i>Ail,</i> irk<i>, and</i> behoove<i>, are regular verbs and transitive; but they are used</i> only in the third person singular: as, "What <i>ails</i> you?"--"It <i>irks</i> me."--"It <i>behooves</i> you." The last two are obsolescent, or at least not in very common use. In Latin, <i>passive</i> verbs, or neuters of the passive form, are often used impersonally, or without an obvious nominative; and this elliptical construction is sometimes imitated in English, especially by the poets: as,</p>
<pre>  "Meanwhile, ere thus <i>was sinn'd</i> and <i>judg'd</i> on earth,
   Within the gates of Hell sat Sin and Death."
       --<i>Milton, P. L.</i>, B. x, l. 230.
</pre>
<pre>  "Forthwith on all sides to his aid <i>was run</i>
   By angels many and strong, who interpos'd."
       --<i>Id.</i>, B. vi, l. 335.

<p>[FORMULE.--Not proper, because the participle <i>being</i> is used after its own verb <i>were</i>. But, according to Observation 4th, on the compound form of the conjugation, this complex passive form is an absurd innovation.

CHAPTER VII.--PARTICIPLES.</p>
<p>A Participle is a word derived from a verb, participating the properties of a verb, and of an adjective or a noun; and is generally formed by adding <i>ing, d</i>, or <i>ed</i>, to the verb: thus, from the verb <i>rule</i>, are formed three participles, two simple and one compound; as, 1. <i>ruling</i>, 2. <i>ruled</i>, 3. <i>having ruled</i>.</p>
<p><br>
OBSERVATIONS.</p>
<p>OBS. 1.--Almost all verbs and participles seem to have their very essence in <i>motion</i>, or <i>the privation of motion</i>--in <i>acting</i>, or <i>ceasing to</i> act<i>. And to all motion and rest,</i> time <i>and</i> place <i>are necessary</i> concomitants; nor are the ideas of <i>degree</i> and <i>manner</i> often irrelevant. Hence the use of <i>tenses</i> and of <i>adverbs</i>. For whatsoever comes to pass, must come to pass <i>sometime</i> and <i>somewhere</i>; and, in every event, something must be affected <i>somewhat</i> and <i>somehow</i>. Hence it is evident that those grammarians are right, who say, that "<i>all participles imply</i> time<i>." But it does not follow, that the</i> English <i>participles</i> divide time, like the tenses of a verb, and <i>specify</i> the period of action; on the contrary, it is certain and manifest, that they do not. The phrase, "<i>men</i> labouring<i>," conveys no other idea than that of</i> labourers at work<i>; it no</i> more suggests the <i>time</i>, than the <i>place, degree</i>, or <i>manner</i>, of their work. All these circumstances require <i>other words</i> to express them; as, "Men <i>now here awkwardly</i> labouring <i>much</i> to little purpose." Again: "<i>Thenceforward</i> will men, <i>there</i> labouring <i>hard</i> and <i>honourably</i>, be looked down upon by dronish lordlings."</p>
<p>OBS. 2.--Participles retain the <i>essential meaning</i> of their verbs; and, <i>like verbs</i>, are either <i>active-transitive, active-intransitive, passive</i>, or <i>neuter</i>, in their signification. For this reason, many have classed them with the verbs. But their <i>formal meaning</i> is obviously different. They convey no affirmation, but usually relate to nouns or pronouns, <i>like</i> adjectives<i>, except when they are joined with auxiliaries to form the</i> compound tenses of their verbs; or when they have in part the nature of substantives, like the Latin gerunds. Hence some have injudiciously ranked them with the adjectives. The most discreet writers have commonly assigned them a separate place among the parts of speech; because, in spite of all opposite usages, experience has shown that it is expedient to do so.</p>
<p>OBS. 3.--According to the doctrine of Harris, all words denoting the <i>attributes</i> of things, are either verbs, or participles, or adjectives. Some attributes have their essence in motion: as, <i>to walk, to run, to fly,</i> to strike, to live<i>; or,</i> walking, running, flying, striking, living<i>.</i> Others have it in the privation of motion: as, <i>to stop, to rest, to cease,</i> to die<i>; or,</i> stopping, resting, ceasing, dying<i>. And there are others</i> which have nothing to do with either motion or its privation; but have their essence in the quantity, quality, or situation of things; as, <i>great</i> and <i>small, white</i> and <i>black, wise</i> and <i>foolish, eastern</i> and <i>western</i>. These last terms are adjectives; and those which denote motion or its privation, are either verbs or participles, according to their formal meaning; that is, according to their manner of attribution. See <i>Hermes</i>, p. 95. Verbs commonly say or affirm something of their subjects; as, "<i>The</i> babe wept<i>." Participles suggest the action or attribute without</i> affirmation; as, "<i>A babe weeping</i>,"--"<i>An act regretted</i>."</p>
<p>OBS. 4.--A verb, then, being expressive of some attribute, which it ascribes to the thing or person named as its subject; of time, which it divides and specifies by the tenses; and also, (with the exception of the infinitive,) of an assertion or affirmation; if we take away the affirmation and the distinction of tenses, there will remain the attribute and the general notion of time; and these form the essence of an English participle. So that a participle is something less than a verb, though derived immediately from it; and something more than an adjective, or mere attribute, though its manner of attribution is commonly the same. Hence, though the participle by rejecting the idea of time may pass almost insensibly into an adjective, and become truly a participial adjective; yet the participle and the adjective are by no means one and the same part of speech, as some will have them to be. There is always an essential difference in their meaning. For instance: there is a difference between <i>a</i> thinking man <i>and</i> a man thinking<i>; between</i> a bragging fellow <i>and</i> a fellow bragging<i>; between</i> a fast-sailing ship <i>and</i> a ship sailing fast<i>.</i> A thinking man, a bragging fellow, or a fast-sailing ship, is contemplated as being habitually or permanently such; a man thinking, a fellow bragging, or a ship sailing fast, is contemplated as performing a particular act; and this must embrace a period of <i>time</i>, whether that time be specified or not. John Locke was a <i>thinking man</i>; but we should directly contradict his own doctrine, to suppose him <i>always thinking</i>.</p>
<p>OBS. 5.--The English participles are all derived from the <i>roots</i> of their respective verbs, and do not, like those of some other languages, take their names from the <i>tenses</i>. On the contrary, they are reckoned among the principal parts in the conjugation of their verbs, and many of the tenses are formed from them. In the compound forms of conjugation, they are found alike <i>in all the tenses</i>. They do not therefore, of themselves, express any particular time; but they denote the state of the being, action, or passion, in regard to its progress or completion. This I conceive to be their principal distinction. Respecting the participles in <i>Latin</i>, it has been matter of dispute, whether those which are called the <i>present</i> and the <i>perfect</i>, are really so in respect to time or not. Sanctius denies it. In <i>Greek</i>, the distinction of tenses in the participles is more apparent, yet even here the time to which they refer, does not always correspond to their names. See remarks on the Participles in the <i>Port Royal Latin and</i> Greek Grammars<i>.</i></p>
<p>OBS. 6.--Horne Tooke supposes our participles in <i>ed</i> to express time past, and those in <i>ing</i> to have no signification of time. He says, "I did not mean to deny the adsignification of time to <i>all</i> the participles; though I continue to withhold it from that which is called the <i>participle</i> present<i>."--</i>Diversions of Purley<i>, Vol. ii, p. 415. Upon the same point,</i> he afterwards adds, "I am neither new nor singular; for Sanctius both asserted and proved it by numerous instances in the Latin. Such as, 'Et <i>abfui proficiscens</i> in Græciam.' <i>Cicero</i>. 'Sed postquam amans <i>accessit</i> pretium <i>pollicens</i>.' <i>Terent</i>. 'Ultro ad cam <i>venies indicans</i> te amare.' <i>Terent</i>. 'Turnum <i>fugientem</i> hæc terra videbit.' <i>Virg</i>."--<i>Tooke's Div.</i>, ii, 420. Again: "And thus I have given you my opinion concerning what is called the <i>present participle</i>. Which I think improperly so called; because I take it to be merely the simple verb <i>adjectived</i>, without any adsignification of <i>manner</i> or <i>time</i>."--<i>Tooke's Div.</i>, Vol. ii, p. 423.</p>
<p>OBS. 7.--I do not agree with this author, either in limiting participles in <i>ed</i> to time past, or in denying all signification of time to those in <i>ing</i>; but I admit that what is commonly called the <i>present participle</i>, is not very properly so denominated, either in English or in Latin, or perhaps in any language. With us, however, this participle is certainly, in very many instances, something else than "merely the simple verb <i>adjectived</i>." For, in the first place, it is often of a complex character, as <i>being loved, being seen</i>, in which two verbs are "<i>adjectived</i>" together, and that by different terminations. Yet do these words as perfectly coalesce in respect to time, as to everything else; and <i>being</i> loved <i>or</i> being seen <i>is confessedly as much a "</i>present<i>" participle, as</i> <i>being</i>, or <i>loving</i>, or <i>seeing</i>--neither form being solely confined to what now is. Again, our participle in <i>ing</i> stands not only for the present participle of the Latin or Greek grammarians, but also for the Latin gerund, and often for the Greek infinitive used substantively; so that by this ending, the English verb is not only <i>adjectived</i>, but also <i>substantived</i>, if one may so speak. For the participle when governed by a preposition, partakes not of the qualities "of a verb and an <i>adjective</i>," but rather of those of a verb and a <i>noun</i>.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>CLASSES.</p>
<p>English verbs, not defective, have severally three participles;[301] which have been very variously denominated, perhaps the most accurately thus: the <i>Imperfect</i>, the <i>Perfect</i>, and the <i>Preperfect</i>. Or, as their order is undisputed, they may he conveniently called the <i>First</i>, the <i>Second</i>, and the <i>Third</i>.</p>
<p>I. The <i>Imperfect participle</i> is that which ends commonly in <i>ing</i>, and implies a continuance of the being, action, or passion: as, <i>being, acting,</i> ruling, loving, defending, terminating<i>.</i></p>
<p>II. The <i>Perfect participle</i> is that which ends commonly in <i>ed</i> or <i>en</i>, and implies a <i>completion</i> of the being, action, or passion: as, <i>been,</i> acted, ruled, loved, defended, terminated<i>.</i></p>
<p>III. The <i>Preperfect participle</i> is that which takes the sign <i>having</i>, and implies a <i>previous completion</i> of the being, action, or passion: as, <i>having loved, having seen, having written; having been loved, having been</i> writing, having been written<i>.</i></p>
<p>The <i>First</i> or <i>Imperfect</i> Participle, when simple, is always formed by adding <i>ing</i> to the radical verb; as, <i>look, looking</i>: when compound, it is formed by prefixing <i>being</i> to some other simple participle; as, <i>being</i> reading, being read, being completed<i>.</i></p>
<p>The <i>Second</i> or <i>Perfect</i> Participle is always simple, and is regularly formed by adding <i>d</i> or <i>ed</i> to the radical verb: those verbs from which it is formed otherwise, are either irregular or redundant.</p>
<p>The <i>Third</i> or <i>Preperfect</i> Participle is always compound, and is formed by prefixing <i>having</i> to the perfect, when the compound is double, and <i>having</i> been <i>to the perfect or the imperfect, when the compound is triple: as,</i> <i>having spoken, having been spoken, having been speaking</i>.</p>
<p><br>
OBSERVATIONS.</p>
<p>OBS. 1.--Some have supposed that both the simple participles denote present <i>time</i>; some have supposed that the one denotes present, and the other, past time; some have supposed that the first denotes no time, and the second time past; some have supposed that neither has any regard to time; and some have supposed that both are of <i>all</i> times. In regard to the distinction of <i>voice</i>, or the manner of their signification, some have supposed the one to be active, and the other to be passive; some have supposed the participle in <i>ing</i> to be active or neuter, and the other active or passive; and some have supposed that either of them may be active, passive, or neuter. Nor is there any more unanimity among grammarians, in respect to the compounds. Hence several different names have been loosely given to each of the participles: and sometimes with manifest impropriety; as when Buchanan, in his conjugations, calls <i>being</i>, "Active,"--and <i>been, having been, having had</i>, "Passive." Learned men may differ in opinion respecting the nature of words, but grammar can never well deserve the name of <i>science</i>, till at least an ordinary share of reason and knowledge appears in the language of those who teach it.</p>
<p>OBS. 2.--The FIRST participle has been called the Present, the Progressive, the Imperfect, the Simple Imperfect, the Indefinite, the Active, the Present Active, the Present Passive, the Present Neuter, and, in the passive voice, the Preterimperfcct, the Compound Imperfect, the Compound Passive, the Passive. The SECOND, which, though it is always but <i>one</i> word<i>, some authors treat as being</i> two participles<i>, or</i> three<i>, has been</i> called the Perfect, the Preter, the Preterperfect, the Imperfect, the Simple Perfect, the Past, the Simple Past, the First Past, the Preterit, the Passive, the Present Passive, the Perfect Active, the Past Active, the Auxiliary Perfect, the Perfect Passive, the Perfect Neuter, the Simple Perfect Active, the Simple Perfect Passive. The THIRD has been called the Compound, the Compound Active, the Compound Passive, the Compound Perfect, the Compound Perfect Active, the Compound Perfect Passive, the Compound Preter, the Present, the Present Perfect, the Past, the Second Past, the Past Compound, the Compound Past, the Prior-perfect, the Prior-present, the Perfect, the Pluperfect, the Preterperfect, the Preperfect.[302]</p>
<p>In teaching others to speak and write well, it becomes us to express our doctrines in the most suitable terms; but the application of a name is of no great consequence, so that the thing itself be rightly understood by the learner. Grammar should be taught in a style at once neat and plain, clear and brief. Upon the choice of his terms, the writer of this work has bestowed much reflection; yet he finds it impossible either to please everybody, or to explain, without intolerable prolixity, all the reasons for preference.</p>
<p>OBS. 3.--The participle in <i>ing</i> represents the action or state as <i>continuing</i> and ever <i>incomplete</i>; it is therefore rightly termed the IMPERFECT participle: whereas the participle in <i>ed</i> always, or at least usually, has reference to the action as <i>done</i> and <i>complete</i>; and is, by proper contradistinction, called the PERFECT participle. It is hardly necessary to add, that the terms <i>perfect</i> and <i>imperfect</i>, as thus applied to the English participles, have no reference to <i>time</i>, or to those <i>tenses</i> of the verb which are usually (but not very accurately) named by these epithets. The terms <i>present</i> and <i>past</i>, which some still prefer to <i>imperfect</i> and <i>perfect</i>, do denote <i>time</i>, and are in a kind of oblique contradistinction; but how well they apply to the participles, may be seen by the following texts: "God <i>was</i> in Christ, <i>reconciling</i> the world unto himself."--"We pray you in Christ's stead, <i>be</i> ye <i>reconciled</i> to God."--ST. PAUL: <i>2 Cor.</i>, v, 19, 20. Here <i>reconciling</i> refers to the death of Christ, and <i>reconciled</i>, to the desired conversion of the Corinthians; and if we call the former a <i>present</i> participle, and the latter a <i>past</i>, (as do Bullions, Burn, Clark, Felton, S. S. Greene, Lennie, Pinneo, and perhaps others,) we nominally reverse the order of time in respect to the events, and egregiously misapply both terms.</p>
<p>OBS. 4.--Though the participle in <i>ing</i> has, by many, been called the <i>Present</i> participle, it is as applicable to past or future, as to present time; otherwise, such expressions as, "I <i>had been writing</i>,"--"I <i>shall be</i> writing<i>," would be solecisms. It has also been called, almost as</i> frequently, the <i>Active</i> participle. But it is not always active, even when derived from an active verb; for such expressions as, "The goods are <i>selling</i>,"--"The ships are now <i>building</i>," are in use, and not without good authority: as, "And hope to allay, by rational discourse, the pains of his joints <i>tearing</i> asunder."--<i>Locke's Essay</i>, p. 285. "Insensible of the designs now <i>forming</i> by Philip."--<i>Goldsmith's Greece</i>, ii, 48. "The improved edition now <i>publishing</i>."--BP. HALIFAX: <i>Pref. to Butler</i>. "The present tense expresses an action now <i>doing</i>."--<i>Emmons's Gram.</i>, p. 40. The distinguishing characteristic of this participle is, that it denotes an unfinished and progressive state of the being, action, or passion; it is therefore properly denominated the IMPERFECT participle. If the term were applied with reference to <i>time</i>, it would be no more objectionable than the word <i>present</i>, and would be equally supported by the usage of the <i>Greek</i> linguists. I am no more inclined to "<i>innovation</i>," than are the pedants who, for the choice here made, have ignorantly brought the false charge against me. This name, authorized by Beattie and Pickbourn, is approved by Lindley Murray,[303] and adopted by several of the more recent grammarians. See the works of Dr. Crombie, J. Grant, T. O. Churchill, R. Hiley, B. H. Smart, M. Harrison, and W. G. Lewis, published in London; and J. M. M'Culloch's Grammar, published in Edinburgh; also some American grammars, as E. Hazen's, N. Butler's, D. B. Tower's, W. H. Wells's, the Sanderses'.</p>
<p>OBS. 5.--The participle in <i>ed</i>, as is mentioned above, usually denotes a <i>completion</i> of the being, action, or passion, and should therefore be denominated the PERFECT participle. But this completion may be spoken of as present, past, or future; for the participle itself has no tenses, and makes no distinction of time, nor should the name be supposed to refer to the perfect tense. The conjugation of any passive verb, is a sufficient proof of all this: nor is the proof invalidated by resolving verbs of this kind into their component parts. Of the participles in <i>ed</i> applied to <i>present</i> time, the following is an example: "Such a course would be less likely to produce injury to health, than the <i>present course pursued</i> at our colleges."--<i>Literary Convention</i>, p. 118. Tooke's notion of grammatical time, appears to have been in several respects a strange one: he accords with those who call this a <i>past</i> participle, and denies to the other not only the name and notion of <i>a tense</i>, but even the <i>general</i> idea <i>of time. In speaking of the old participial termination</i> and <i>or</i> <i>ende</i>,[304] which our Anglo-Saxon ancestors used where we write <i>ing</i>, he says, "I do not allow that there are any <i>present</i> participles, or any <i>present tense</i> of the verb." [305]--<i>Diversions of Purley</i>, Vol. ii, p. 41.</p>
<p>OBS. 6.--The <i>Perfect</i> participle of transitive verbs, being used in the formation of passive verbs, is sometimes called the <i>Passive</i> participle. It usually has in itself a passive signification, except when it is used in forming the compound tenses of the active verb. Hence the difference between the sentences, "I have written a letter," and, "I have a letter written;" the former being equivalent to <i>Scripsi literas</i>, and the latter to <i>Sunt mihi literæ scriptæ</i>. But there are many perfect participles which cannot with any propriety be called passive. Such are all those which come from intransitive or neuter verbs; and also those which so often occur in the tenses of verbs not passive. I have already noticed some instances of this misnomer; and it is better to preclude it altogether, by adhering to the true name of this Participle, THE PERFECT. Nor is that entirely true which some assert, "that this participle in the <i>active</i> is only found in combination;" that, "Whenever it stands alone to be parsed as a participle, it is passive."--<i>Hart's English Gram.</i>, p. 75. See also <i>Bullions's</i> Analyt. and Pract. Gram.<i>, p. 77; and</i> Greene's Analysis, or Gram.<i>, p.</i> 225. "Rebelled," in the following examples, cannot with any propriety be called a <i>passive</i> participle:</p>
<pre>  "<i>Rebelled</i>, did I not send them terms of peace,
   Which not my justice, but my mercy asked?"--<i>Pollok</i>, x, 253.
</pre>
<pre>   "Arm'd with thy might, rid Heav'n of these <i>rebell'd</i>,
   To their prepar'd ill mansion driven down."--<i>Milton</i>, vi, 737.
</pre>
<p>OBS. 7.--The third participle has most generally been called the <i>Compound</i>, or the <i>Compound perfect</i>. The latter of these terms seems to be rather objectionable on account of its length; and against the former it may be urged that, in the compound forms of conjugation, the first or imperfect participle is a compound: as, <i>being writing, being seen</i>. Dr. Adam calls <i>having loved</i> the <i>perfect</i> participle <i>active</i>, which he says must be rendered in Latin by the <i>pluperfect</i> of the subjunctive; as, he having loved, <i>quum amavisset</i>; (<i>Lat. and Eng. Gram.</i>, p. 140;) but it is manifest that the perfect participle of the verb <i>to love</i>, whether active or passive, is the simple word <i>loved</i>, and not this compound. Dr. Adam, in fact, if he denies this, only contradicts himself; for, in his paradigms of the English Active Voice, he gives the participles as two only, and both simple, thus: "<i>Present</i>, Loving; <i>Perfect</i>, Loved:"--"<i>Present</i>, Having; <i>Perfect</i>, Had." So of the Neuter Verb: "<i>Present</i>, Being; <i>Perfect</i>, Been."--<i>Ib.</i>, pp. 81 and 82. His scheme of either names or forms is no model of accuracy. On the very next page, unless there is a misprint in several editions, he calls the <i>Second</i> participle the "<i>imperfect</i>;" saying, "The whole of the passive voice in English is formed by the auxiliary verb <i>to be</i>, and the participle <i>imperfect</i>; as, <i>I am loved, I</i> was loved, &amp;c<i>." Further: "In many verbs," he adds, "the</i> present participle also is used in a passive sense; as, <i>These things are doing,</i> were doing<i>, &amp;c.;</i> The house is building, was building<i>, &amp;c."--</i>Ib.<i>, p.</i> 83. N. Butler, in his Practical Grammar, of 1845, names, and counts, and orders, the participles very oddly: "Every verb," he says, "has <i>two</i> participles--the <i>imperfect</i> and the <i>perfect</i>."--P. 78. Yet, for the verb <i>love</i>, he finds these six: two "IMPERFECT, <i>Loving</i> and <i>Being loved</i>;" two "PERFECT, <i>Having loved</i>, and <i>Having been loved</i>;" one "AUXILIARY PERFECT, <i>Loved</i>," of the "<i>Active Voice</i>;" and one "PASSIVE, <i>Loved</i>," of the "<i>Passive Voice</i>." Many old writers erroneously represent the participle in <i>ing</i> as always active, and the participle in <i>ed</i> or <i>en</i> as always passive; and some, among whom is Buchanan, making no distinction between the simple perfect <i>loved</i> and the compound <i>having loved</i>, place the latter with the former, and call it passive also. The absurdity of this is manifest: for <i>having loved</i> or <i>having seen</i> is active; <i>having been</i> or <i>having sat</i> is neuter; and <i>having been loved</i> or <i>having been seen</i> is passive. Again, the triple compound, <i>having been writing</i>, is active; and <i>having been sitting</i> is neuter; but if one speak of goods as <i>having been</i> selling <i>low, a similar compound is passive.</i></p>
<p>OBS. 8.--Now all the compound participles which begin with <i>having</i> are essentially alike; and, as a class of terms, they ought to have a name adapted to their nature, and expressive of their leading characteristic. <i>Having loved</i> differs from the simple participle <i>loved</i>, in signification as well as in form; and, if this participle is to be named with reference to its <i>meaning</i>, there is no more suitable term for it than the epithet PREPERFECT,--a word which explains itself, like <i>prepaid</i> or <i>prerequisite</i>. Of the many other names, the most correct one is PLUPERFECT,--which is a term of very nearly the same meaning. Not because this compound is really of the pluperfect <i>tense</i>, but because it always denotes being, action, or passion, that is, or was, or will be, <i>completed</i> before <i>the doing or being of something else; and, of course, when the</i> latter thing is represented as past, the participle must correspond to the pluperfect tense of its verb; as, "<i>Having explained</i> her views, it was necessary she should expatiate on the vanity and futility of the enjoyments promised by Pleasure."--<i>Jamieson's Rhet.</i>, p. 181. Here <i>having explained</i> is exactly equivalent to <i>when she had explained</i>. Again: "I may say, <i>He</i> had commanded<i>, and we obeyed; or,</i> He having commanded<i>, we</i> obeyed."--<i>Fetch's Comprehensive Gram.</i>, p. ix. Here the two phrases in Italics correspond in import, though not in construction.</p>
<p>OBS. 9.--<i>Pluperfect</i> is a derivative contracted from the Latin <i>plusquam-perfectum</i>, and literally signifies <i>more than complete</i>, or <i>beyond the perfect</i>; i. e., (as confirmed by use,) <i>antecedently</i> finished<i>, or</i> completed before<i>. It is the usual name of our fourth tense;</i> is likewise applicable to a corresponding tense in other tongues; and is a word familiar to every scholar. Yet several grammarians,--too ready, perhaps, for innovation,--have shown their willingness to discard it altogether. Bullions, Butler, Hiley, Perley, Wells, and some others, call the English <i>pluperfect tense</i>, the <i>past-perfect</i>, and understand either epithet to mean--"<i>completed at or before</i> a certain <i>past</i> time;" (<i>Bullions's E. Gram.</i>, p. 39;) that is--"<i>finished or past, at</i> some <i>past</i> time."--<i>Butler's Pract. Gram.</i>, p. 72. The relation of the <i>tense</i> is <i>before the past</i>, but the epithet <i>pluperfect</i> is not necessarily limited to this relation, any more than what is <i>perfect</i> is necessarily past. Butler has urged, that, "<i>Pluperfect</i> does not mean <i>completed</i> before<i>," but is only "a technical name of a particular tense;" and,</i> arguing from this erroneous assumption, has convinced himself, "It would be as correct to call this the <i>second future</i> participle, as the <i>pluperfect</i>."--<i>Ib.</i>, p. 79. The technical name, as limited to the past, is <i>preterpluperfect</i>, from the older term <i>præteritum plusquam perfectum</i>; so <i>preterperfect</i>, from <i>præteritum perfectum</i>, i. e. <i>past perfect</i>, is the name of an <i>other</i> tense, now called the <i>perfect</i>: wherefore the substitution of <i>past-perfect</i> for <i>pluperfect</i> is the less to be commended. There may be a convenience in having the name of the tense to differ from that of the participle, and this alone induces me to prefer <i>preperfect</i> to <i>pluperfect</i> for the name of the latter.</p>
<p>OBS. 10.--From the participle in <i>ed</i> or <i>en</i>, we form three tenses, which the above-named authors call <i>perfect</i>;--"the <i>present-perfect</i>, the <i>past-perfect</i>, and the <i>future-perfect</i>;"--as, <i>have seen, had seen, will</i> have seen<i>. Now it is, doubtless, the</i> participle<i>, that gives to these</i> their <i>perfectness</i>; while diversity in the auxiliaries makes their difference of time. Yet it is assumed by Butler, that, in general, the simple participle in <i>ed</i> or <i>en</i>, "does not denote an action <i>done</i> and <i>completed</i>," and is not to be called <i>perfect</i>; (p. 80;)--that, "If we wish to express by a participle, an action <i>completed at any time</i>, we use the compound form, and <i>this is</i> THE <i>perfect participle</i>;" (p. 79;)--that, "<i>The characteristic</i> of the participle in <i>ed</i> is, that it implies the <i>reception</i> of an action;" (p. 79;)--that, hence, it should be called <i>the</i> passive<i>, though it "is</i> usually <i>called the</i> perfect <i>participle;" (p.</i> 79;)--that, "The use of <i>this participle</i> in the <i>perfect tenses</i> of the active voice should not be taken into consideration in giving it a name or a definition;" (p. 80;)--that its <i>active, neuter</i>, or <i>intransitive</i> use is not a primitive idiom of the language, but the result of a gradual <i>change</i> of the term from the passive to the active voice; (p. 80;)--that, "the participle <i>has changed</i> its mode of signification, so that, instead of being passive, it is now active in sense;" (p. 105;)--that, "having changed its original meaning so entirely, it should not be considered <i>the</i> same <i>participle;" (p. 78;)--that, "in such cases, it is a</i> perfect participle," and, "for the sake of distinction [,] this may be called the <i>auxiliary perfect</i> participle."--<i>Ib.</i> These speculations I briefly throw before the reader, without designing much comment upon them. It will be perceived that they are, in several respects, contradictory one to an other. The author himself names the participle in reference to a usage which he says, "should not be taken into consideration;" and names it absurdly too; for he calls that "the <i>auxiliary</i>," which is manifestly the <i>principal</i> term. He also identifies as one what he professes to distinguish as two.</p>
<p>OBS. 11.--Participles often become <i>adjectives</i>, and are construed before nouns to denote quality. The terms so converted form the class of <i>participial adjectives</i>. Words of a participial form may be regarded as adjectives, under the following circumstances: 1. When they reject the idea of time, and denote something customary or habitual, rather than a transient act or state; as, "A <i>lying</i> rogue,"--i.e., one that is addicted to lying. 2. When they admit adverbs of comparison; as, "A <i>more learned</i> man." 3. When they are compounded with something that does not belong to the verb; as, "<i>unfeeling, unfelt</i>:" there is no verb <i>to unfeel</i>, therefore these words cannot be participles. Adjectives are generally placed before their nouns; participles, after them. The words beginning with <i>un</i>, in the following lines may be classed with participial adjectives:</p>
<pre>  "No king, no subject was; unscutcheoned all;
   Uncrowned, unplumed, unhelmed, unpedigreed;
   Unlaced, uncoroneted, unbestarred."
       --<i>Pollok, C. of T.</i>, B. viii, l. 89.
</pre>
<p>OBS. 12.--Participles in <i>ing</i> often become <i>nouns</i>. When preceded by an article, an adjective or a noun or pronoun of the possessive case, they are construed as nouns; and, if wholly such, have neither adverbs nor active regimen: as, "He laugheth at the <i>shaking</i> of a spear."--<i>Job</i>, xli, 29. "There is <i>no searching</i> of <i>his understanding</i>."--<i>Isaiah</i>, xl, 28. "In <i>their setting</i> of their threshold by ray threshold."--<i>Ezekiel</i>, xliii, 8. "That any man should make <i>my glorying</i> void."--<i>1 Cor.</i>, ix, 15. The terms so converted form the class of <i>verbal</i> or <i>participial</i> nouns. But some late authors--(J. S. Hart, S. S. Greene, W. H. Wells, and others--) have given the name of participial nouns to many <i>participles</i>,--such participles, often, as retain all their verbal properties and adjuncts, and merely partake of some syntactical resemblance to nouns. Now, since the chief characteristics of such words are from the verb, and are incompatible with the specific nature of a noun, it is clearly improper to call them <i>nouns</i>. There are, in the popular use of participles, certain mixed constructions which are reprehensible; yet it is the peculiar nature of a <i>participle</i>, to participate the properties of other parts of speech,--of the verb and adjective,--of the verb and noun,--or sometimes, perhaps, of all three. A participle immediately preceded by a preposition, is not converted into a noun, but remains a participle, and therefore retains its adverb, and also its government of the objective case; as, "I thank you <i>for helping him so seasonably</i>." Participles in this construction correspond with the Latin gerund, and are sometimes called <i>gerundives</i>.</p>
<p>OBS. 13.--To distinguish the participle from the participial noun, the learner should observe the following four things: 1. Nouns take articles and adjectives before them; participles, as such, do not. 2. Nouns may govern the possessive case before them, but not the objective after them; participles may govern the objective case, but not so properly the possessive. 3. Nouns, if they have adverbs, require the hyphen; participles take adverbs separately, as do their verbs. 4. Participial nouns express actions as things, and are sometimes declined like other nouns; participles usually refer actions to their agents or recipients, and have in English no grammatical modifications of any kind.</p>
<p>OBS. 14.--To distinguish the perfect participle from the preterit of the same form, observe <i>the sense</i>, and see which of the auxiliary forms will express it: thus, <i>loved</i> for <i>being loved</i>, is a participle; but <i>loved</i> for <i>did love</i>, is a preterit verb. So <i>held</i> for <i>did hold, stung</i> for <i>did sting, taught</i> for <i>did teach</i>, and the like, are irregular verbs; but <i>held</i> for <i>being held, stung</i> for <i>being stung, taught</i> for <i>being</i> taught<i>, and the like, are perfect participles.</i></p>
<p>OBS. 15.--Though the English participles have no inflections, and are consequently incapable of any grammatical agreement or disagreement, those which are simple, are sometimes elegantly taken in a plural sense, with the apparent construction of <i>nouns</i>; but, under these circumstances, they are in reality neither nouns nor participles, but participial adjectives construed elliptically, as other adjectives often are, and relating to plural nouns understood. The ellipsis is sometimes of a singular noun, though very rarely, and much less properly. Examples: "To them who are <i>the</i> called <i>according to his purpose."--</i>Rom.<i>, x, 28. That is--"the called</i> <i>ones</i> or <i>persons</i>." "God is not the God of <i>the dead</i>, but of <i>the</i> living<i>."--</i>Matt.<i>, xxii, 32. "Neither is it found in the land of</i> the living<i>."--</i>Job<i>, xxviii, 13. "</i>The living, the living, he <i>shall praise</i> thee, as I do this day."--<i>Isaiah</i>, xxxviii, 19. "Till we are made fit to live and reign with him and <i>all his redeemed</i>, in the heavenly glory forever."--<i>Jenks's Prayers</i>, p. 18.</p>
<pre>  "<i>Ye blessed</i> of my Father, come, <i>ye just</i>,
   Enter the joy eternal of your Lord."--<i>Pollok</i>, B. x, l. 591.
</pre>
<pre>   "Depart from me, <i>ye cursed</i>, into the fire
   Prepared eternal in the gulf of Hell."--<i>Id.</i>, B. x, l. 449.

EXAMPLES FOR PARSING.</p>
<p>PRAXIS VII.--ETYMOLOGICAL.</p>
<p><i>In the Seventh Praxis it is required of the pupil--to distinguish and</i> define the different parts of speech, and the classes and modifications of the <i>ARTICLES, NOUNS, ADJECTIVES, PRONOUNS, VERBS, and PARTICIPLES.</i></p>
<p><i>The definitions to be given in the Seventh Praxis, are two for an article,</i> six for a noun, three for an adjective, six for a pronoun, seven for a verb finite, five for an infinitive, two for a participle,--and one for an adverb, a conjunction, a preposition, or an interjection. Thus<i>:--</i></p>
<p>EXAMPLE PARSED.</p>
<p>"Religion, rightly understood and practised, has the purest of all joys attending it."</p>
<p><i>Religion</i> is a common noun, of the third person, singular number, neuter gender, and nominative case. 1. A noun is the name of any person, place, or thing, that can be known or mentioned. 2.

IMPROPRIETIES FOR CORRECTION.</p>
<p>ERRORS OF PARTICIPLES.</p>
<p>[Fist] [As the principles upon which our participles ought to be formed, were necessarily anticipated in the preceding chapter on verbs, the reader must recur to that chapter for the doctrines by which the following errors are to be corrected. The great length of that chapter seemed a good reason for separating these examples from it, and it was also thought, that such words as are erroneously written for participles, should, for the sake of order, be chiefly noticed in this place. In many of these examples, however, the participle is not really a separate part of speech, but is in fact taken with an auxiliary to form some compound tense of its verb.]</p>
<p><br>
LESSON I.--IRREGULARS.</p>
<p>"Many of your readers have mistook that passage."--<i>Steele, Spect.</i>, No. 544.</p>
<p>[FORMULE.--Not proper, because the preterit verb <i>mistook</i> is here used for the perfect participle. But, according to the table of irregular verbs, we ought to say, <i>mistake, mistook, mistaking, mistaken</i>; after the form of the simple verb, <i>take, took, taking, taken</i>. Therefore, the sentence should be amended thus: "Many of your readers have <i>mistaken</i> that passage."]</p>
<p>"Had not my dog of a steward ran away."--<i>Addison, Spect.</i> "None should be admitted, except he had broke his collar-bone thrice."--<i>Spect.</i>, No. 474.

<p>[FORMULE.--Not proper, because the participle <i>stript</i> is terminated in <i>t</i>. But, according to Observation 2d, on the irregular verbs, <i>stript</i> is regular. Therefore, this <i>t</i> should be changed to <i>ed</i>; and the final <i>p</i> should be doubled, according to Rule 3d for Spelling: thus, "When the word is <i>stripped</i> of all the terminations."]</p>

<p>[FORMULE.--Not proper, because the participle <i>holden</i> is not in that form which present usage authorizes. But, according to the table of irregular verbs, the four parts of the verb <i>to hold</i>, as now used, are <i>hold, held,</i> holding, held<i>. Therefore,</i> holden <i>should be</i> held<i>; thus, "The lands are</i> <i>held</i> in free and common soccage."]</p>

CHAPTER VIII.--ADVERBS.</p>
<p>An Adverb is a word added to a verb, a participle, an adjective, or an other adverb; and generally expresses time, place, degree, or manner: as, They are <i>now here</i>, studying <i>very diligently</i>.</p>
<p><br>
OBSERVATIONS.</p>
<p>OBS. 1.--Adverbs briefly express what would otherwise require several words: as <i>Now</i>, for <i>at this time</i>;--<i>Here</i>, for <i>in this place</i>;--<i>Very</i>, for <i>in a high degree</i>;--<i>Diligently</i>, for <i>in an industrious manner</i>. Thus the meaning of almost any adverb, may be explained by some phrase beginning with a preposition and ending with a noun.</p>
<p>OBS. 2.--There are several customary combinations of short words, which are used adverbially, and which some grammarians do not analyze in parsing; <i>as, not at all, at</i> length, in fine, in full, at least, at present, at once, this once, in vain, no doubt, on board<i>. But all words that convey distinct ideas, and</i> rightly retain their individuality, ought to be taken separately in parsing. With the liberty of supposing a few ellipses, an ingenious parser will seldom find occasion to speak of "adverbial phrases." In these instances, <i>length, doubt, fine</i>, and <i>board</i>, are unquestionably nouns; <i>once</i>, too, is used as a noun; <i>full</i> and <i>all</i> may be parsed either as nouns, or as adjectives whose nouns are understood; <i>at least</i>, is, <i>at the</i> least measure; at present<i>, is,</i> at the present time<i>; and</i> in vain<i>, is,</i> <i>in a vain course, or manner.</i></p>
<p>OBS. 3.--A phrase is a combination of two or more separable parts of speech, the <i>parsing</i> of which of course implies their separation. And though the division of our language into words, and the division of its words into parts of speech, have never yet been made exactly to correspond, it is certainly desirable to bring them as near together as possible. Hence such terms as <i>everywhere, anywhere, nowadays, forever, everso, to-day,</i> to-morrow, by-and-by, inside-out, upside-down<i>, if they are to be parsed</i> simply as adverbs, ought to be compounded, and not written as phrases.</p>
<p>OBS. 4--Under nearly all the different classes of words, some particular instances may be quoted, in which other parts of speech seem to take the nature of adverbs, so as either to become such, or to be apparently used <i>for</i> them. (1.) ARTICLES: "This may appear incredible, but it is not <i>the</i> less true."--<i>Dr. Murray's Hist.</i>, i, 337. "The other party was <i>a</i> little coy."--<i>D. Webster.</i> (2.) NOUNS: "And scrutiny became <i>stone</i>[306] blind."--<i>Cowper.</i> "He will come <i>home to-morrow.</i>"--<i>Clark.</i> "They were travelling <i>post</i> when he met them."--<i>Murray's Gram.</i>, p. 69. "And with a vengeance sent from Media <i>post</i> to Egypt."--<i>Milton, P. L.</i>, B. iv, l. 170. "That I should care <i>a groat</i> whether he likes the work or not."--<i>Kirkham.</i> "It has snowed terribly all night, and is <i>vengeance</i> cold."--<i>Swift.</i> (3.) ADJECTIVES: "Drink <i>deep</i>, or taste not."--<i>Pope.</i> "A place <i>wondrous</i> deep."--<i>Webster's Dict.</i> "That fools should be so <i>deep</i> contemplative."--<i>Shak.</i> "A man may speak <i>louder</i> or <i>softer</i> in the same key; when he speaks <i>higher</i> or <i>lower</i>, he changes his key."--<i>Sheridan's</i> Elocution<i>, p. 116. (4.) PRONOUNS: "</i>What <i>am I eased?"--</i>Job. <i>"</i>What have I offended thee?"--<i>Gen.</i>, xx, 9. "He is <i>somewhat</i> arrogant."--<i>Dryden.</i> (5.) VERBS: "<i>Smack</i> went the whip, round went the wheels."--<i>Cowper.</i> "For then the farmers came <i>jog, jog</i>, along the miry road."--<i>Id.</i> "<i>Crack!</i> went something on deck."--<i>Robinson Crusoe.</i> "Then straight went the yard <i>slap</i> over their noddle."--Arbuthnot. (6.) PARTICIPLES: "Like medicines given <i>scalding</i> hot."--<i>Dodd.</i> "My clothes are almost <i>dripping</i> wet."--"In came Squire South, stark, <i>staring</i> mad."--<i>Arbuthnot.</i> "An <i>exceeding</i> high mountain."--<i>Matt.</i>, iv, 8. "How sweet, how <i>passing</i> sweet, the hour to me!"--<i>Ch. Observer.</i> "When we act <i>according</i> to our duty."--<i>Dr. Johnson.</i> "A man was famous <i>according</i> as he had lifted up axes upon the thick trees."--<i>Psal.</i>, lxxiv, 5. (7.) CONJUNCTIONS: "Look, <i>as</i> I blow this feather from my face."--<i>Shak.</i> "Not at all, or <i>but</i> very gently."--<i>Locke.</i> "He was <i>but</i> born to try the lot of man."--<i>Pope.</i> (8.) PREPOSITIONS: "They shall go <i>in</i> and <i>out.</i>"--<i>Bible.</i> "From going <i>to</i> and <i>fro</i> in the earth, and walking <i>up</i> and <i>down</i> in it."--<i>Ib.</i> These are actually <i>adverbs</i>, and not prepositions, because they govern nothing. (9.) INTERJECTIONS are never used as adverbs, though the Greek grammarians refer them nearly all to this class. The using of other words for adverbs, (i. e., the adverbial use of any words that we do not actually call adverbs,) may be referred to the figure <i>enallage</i>:[307] as,</p>
<pre>  "<i>Tramp, tramp</i>, across the land they speed,
   <i>Splash, splash</i>, across the sea."--<i>Burger.</i>
</pre>
<p>OBS. 5.--As other parts of speech seem sometimes to take the nature of adverbs, so adverbs sometimes, either really or apparently, assume the nature of other parts of speech. (1.) Of NOUNS: as, "A committee is not needed merely to say <i>Yes</i> or <i>No</i>; that will do very little good; <i>the</i> yes <i>or</i> the no <i>must be accompanied and supported by reasons."--</i>Dr. M'Cartee. <i>"Shall I tell you</i> why? <i>Ay, sir, and</i> wherefore<i>; for, they</i> say, every <i>why</i> hath a <i>wherefore.</i>"--<i>Shak.</i> (2.) Of ADJECTIVES: as, "Nebuchadnezzar invaded the country, and reduced it to an <i>almost</i> desert."--<i>Wood's Dict., w. Moab.</i> "The <i>then</i> bishop of London, Dr. Laud, attended on his Majesty."--<i>Clarendon.</i> "With <i>upward</i> speed his agile wings he spread."--<i>Prior.</i> "She lights the <i>downward</i> heaven, and rises there."--<i>Dryden.</i> (3.) Of PRONOUNS: as, "He liked the ground <i>whereon</i> she trod."--<i>Milton.</i> "<i>Wherein</i> have you been galled by the king?"--<i>Shak.</i> "O how unlike the place from <i>whence</i> they fell!"--<i>Par. Lost</i>, B. i, l. 75. Here <i>whereon</i> is exactly equivalent in sense to <i>on which; wherein</i>, to <i>in what</i>; and <i>whence</i>, to <i>which</i>: but none of them are actually reckoned pronouns. (4.) Of VERBS: as, "If he be hungry, more than wanton, bread alone will <i>down.</i>"--<i>Locke.</i> "To <i>down</i> proud hearts that would not willing die."--<i>Sidney.</i> "She never could <i>away</i> with me."--<i>Shak.</i> "<i>Away</i>, and glister like the god of war."--<i>Id.</i> "<i>Up</i>, get ye out of this place."--<i>Gen.</i>, xix, 14. (5.) Of CONJUNCTIONS: as, "I, <i>even</i> I, am he."--<i>Isaiah</i>, xliii, 25. "If I will that he tarry <i>till</i> I come."--<i>John</i>, xxi, 22. "I will go and see him <i>before</i> I die."--<i>Gen.</i>, xlv, 28. "Before I go <i>whence</i> I shall not return."--<i>Job</i>, x, 21. (6) Of PREPOSITIONS: as, "Superior to any that are dug <i>out</i> the ground."--<i>Eames's Lect.</i>, p. 28. "Who act <i>so counter</i> heavenly mercy's plan."--<i>Burns.</i> Better perhaps, "<i>out of</i>" and "<i>counter to.</i>" (7.) Of INTERJECTIONS: as, "<i>Up, up</i>, Glentarkin! rouse thee, ho!"--<i>Scott.</i> "<i>Down, down</i>, cried Mar, your lances <i>down!</i>"--<i>Id.</i> "<i>Off!</i> or I fly for ever from thy sight."--<i>Smith.</i></p>
<p>OBS. 6.--In these last examples, <i>up</i>, and <i>down</i>, and <i>off</i>, have perhaps as much resemblance to imperative verbs, as to interjections; but they need not be referred to either of these classes, because by supplying a verb we may easily parse them as adverbs. I neither adopt the notion of Horne Tooke, that the same word cannot belong to different parts of speech, nor refer every word to that class to which it may at first sight appear to belong; for both of these methods are impracticable and absurd. The essential nature of each part of speech, and every important peculiarity of its individual terms, it is hoped, will be sufficiently explained in some part or other of this work; but, as the classification of words often depends upon their <i>construction</i>, some explanations that go to determine the parts of speech, must be looked for under the head of Syntax.</p>
<p>OBS. 7.--The proper classification, or subdivision, of adverbs, though it does not appear to have been discovered by any of our earlier grammarians, is certainly very clearly indicated by the meaning and nature of the words themselves. The four important circumstances of any event or assertion, are the <i>when</i>, the <i>where</i>, the <i>how-much</i>, and the <i>how</i>; or the <i>time</i>, the <i>place</i>, the <i>degree</i>, and the <i>manner</i>. These four are the things which we usually express by adverbs. And seldom, if ever, do we find any adverb the notion of which does not correspond to that of <i>sometime, somewhere,</i> somewhat<i>, or</i> somehow<i>. Hence, the general classes of this sort of words</i> ought to be formed under these four heads. The classification heretofore most commonly adopted in English grammar, has every fault which the spirit of awkwardness could possibly give it. The head of it is this: "Adverbs, <i>though very numerous</i>, may be reduced to <i>certain</i> classes, the <i>chief</i> of which are <i>those of</i> Number, Order, Place, Time, Quantity, Manner or Quality, Doubt, Affirmation, Negation, Interrogation, and Comparison."--<i>Murray's Gram.</i>, p. 115; <i>Comly's</i>, 66; <i>Kirkham's</i>, 86; <i>R.</i> C. Smith's<i>, 34;</i> Hall's<i>, 26;</i> and others<i>.</i></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>CLASSES.</p>
<p>Adverbs may be reduced to four general classes; namely, adverbs of <i>time</i>, of <i>place</i>, of <i>degree</i>, and of <i>manner</i>. Besides these, it is proper to distinguish the particular class of <i>conjunctive</i> adverbs.</p>
<p>I. Adverbs of <i>time</i> are those which answer to the question, <i>When? How</i> long? How soon? <i>or,</i> How often? <i>including these which ask.</i></p>
<p>OBS.--Adverbs of time may be subdivided as follows:--</p>
<p>1. Of time present; as, <i>Now, yet, to-day, nowadays, presently, instantly,</i> immediately, straightway, directly, forthwith<i>.</i></p>
<p>2. Of time past; as, <i>Already, just now, lately, recently, yesterday,</i> formerly, anciently, once, heretofore, hitherto, since, till now, long ago, erewhile, erst<i>.</i></p>
<p>3. Of time to come; as, <i>To-morrow, hereafter, henceforth, henceforward,</i> by-and-by, soon, erelong, shortly<i>.</i></p>
<p>4. Of time relative; as, <i>When, then, first, just, before, after, while,</i> whilst, meanwhile, as, till, until, seasonably, betimes, early, late, whenever, afterward, afterwards, otherwhile, otherwhiles<i>.</i></p>
<p>5. Of time absolute; as, <i>Always, ever, never, aye, eternally, forever,</i> perpetually, continually, incessantly, endlessly, evermore, everlastingly<i>.</i></p>
<p>6. Of time repeated; as, <i>Often, oft, again, occasionally, frequently,</i> sometimes, seldom, rarely, daily, weekly, monthly, yearly, annually, once, twice, thrice<i>, or</i> three times<i>. Above this, we use only the phrases</i> <i>four times, five times, six times, &amp;c</i>. Whether these ought to be reckoned adverbs, or not, is questionable: <i>times</i>, for <i>repetitions</i>, or <i>instances</i>, may be supposed a noun; but such phrases often appear to be used adverbially.</p>
<p><br>
II. Adverbs of <i>place</i> are those which answer to the question, <i>Where?</i> Whither? Whence? <i>or,</i> Whereabout? <i>including these which ask.</i></p>
<p>OBS.--Adverbs of place may be subdivided as follows:--</p>
<p>1. Of place in which; as, <i>Where, here, there, yonder, above, below, about,</i> around, somewhere, anywhere, elsewhere, otherwhere, everywhere, nowhere, wherever, wheresoever, within, without, whereabout, whereabouts, hereabout, hereabouts, thereabout, thereabouts<i>.</i></p>
<p>2. Of place to which; as, <i>Whither, hither, thither, in, up, down, back,</i> forth, aside, ashore, abroad, aloft, home, homewards, inwards, upwards, downwards, backwards, forwards<i>.</i> Inward, homeward, upward, downward, backward<i>, and</i> forward<i>, are also adverbs, as well as adjectives; but some</i> critics, for distinction's sake, choose to use these only as adjectives.</p>
<p>3. Of place from which; as, <i>Whence, hence, thence, away, out, off, far,</i> remotely<i>.</i></p>
<p>4. Of the order of place; as, <i>First, secondly, thirdly, fourthly, &amp;c</i>. Thus, <i>secondly</i> means <i>in the second place</i>; <i>thirdly, in the third</i> place<i>; &amp;c. For order, or rank, implies place, though it may consist of</i> relative degrees.</p>
<p><br>
III. Adverbs of <i>degree</i> are those which answer to the question, <i>How much?</i> How little? <i>or, to the idea of</i> more or less<i>.</i></p>
<p>OBS.--Adverbs of degree may be subdivided as follows:--</p>
<p>1. Of excess or abundance; as, <i>Much, more, most, too, very, greatly, far,</i> besides; chiefly, principally, mainly, mostly, generally; entirely, full, fully, completely, perfectly, wholly, totally, altogether, all, quite, clear, stark; exceedingly, excessively, extravagantly, intolerably; immeasurably, inconceivably, infinitely<i>.</i></p>
<p>2. Of equality or sufficiency; as, <i>Enough, sufficiently, competently,</i> adequately, proportionally, equally, so, as, even, just, exactly, precisely<i>.</i></p>
<p>3. Of deficiency or abatement; as, <i>Little, less, least, scarcely, hardly,</i> scantly, scantily merely, barely, only, but, partly, partially, nearly, almost, well-nigh, not quite<i>.</i></p>
<p>4. Of quantity in the abstract; as, <i>How</i>, (meaning, <i>in what degree</i>,) <i>however, howsoever, everso, something, anything, nothing, a groat, a</i> sixpence, a sou-markee<i>, and other nouns of quantity used adverbially.</i></p>
<p><br>
IV. Adverbs of <i>manner</i> are those which answer to the question, <i>How?</i> or, by affirming, denying, or doubting, show <i>how</i> a subject is regarded.</p>
<p>OBS.--Adverbs of manner may be subdivided as follows:--</p>
<p>1. Of manner from quality; as, <i>Well, ill, wisely, foolishly, justly,</i> wickedly<i>, and many others formed by adding</i> ly <i>to adjectives of quality.</i> <i>Ly</i> is a contraction of <i>like</i>; and is the most common termination of English adverbs. When added to nouns, it forms adjectives; but some few of these are also used adverbially; as, <i>daily, weekly, monthly</i>, which denote time.</p>
<p>2. Of affirmation or assent; as, <i>Yes, yea, ay, verily, truly, indeed,</i> surely, certainly, doubtless, undoubtedly, assuredly, certes, forsooth,[308] amen<i>.</i></p>
<p>3. Of negation; as, <i>No, nay, not, nowise, noway, noways, nohow</i>.</p>
<p>4. Of doubt or uncertainty; as, <i>Perhaps, haply, possibly, perchance,</i> peradventure, may-be<i>.</i></p>
<p>5. Of mode or way; as, <i>Thus, so, how, somehow, nohow, anyhow, however,</i> howsoever, like, else, otherwise, across, together, apart, asunder, namely, particularly, necessarily, hesitatingly, trippingly, extempore, headlong, lengthwise<i>.</i></p>
<p><br>
V. <i>Conjunctive adverbs</i> are those which perform the office of conjunctions, and serve to connect sentences, as well as to express some circumstance of time, place, degree, or the like. This class embraces a few words not strictly belonging to any of the others: as, (1.) The adverbs of cause; <i>why, wherefore, therefore</i>; but the last two of these are often called conjunctions. (2.) The pronominal compounds; <i>herein, therein,</i> wherein<i>, &amp;c.; in which the former term is a substitute, and virtually</i> governed by the enclitic particle.</p>
<p><br>
OBSERVATIONS.</p>
<p>OBS. 1.--Conjunctive adverbs often relate equally to two verbs in different clauses, on which account it is the more necessary to distinguish them from others; as, "And they feared <i>when</i> they heard that they were Romans,"--<i>Acts</i>, xvi, 38. Here <i>when</i> is a conjunctive adverb of time, and relates equally to <i>feared</i> and to <i>heard</i>. "The right of coming on the shore for their purposes in general, <i>as</i> and <i>when</i> they please."--<i>Holroyd</i>. Here <i>as</i> is a conjunctive adverb of manner, and <i>when</i>, of time; both relating equally to <i>coming</i> and to <i>please</i>.</p>
<p>OBS. 2.--The following words are the most frequently used as conjunctive adverbs: <i>after, again, also, as, before, besides, consequently, else, ere,</i> even, furthermore, hence, how, however, moreover, nevertheless, otherwise, since, so, still, till, then, thence, therefore, too, until, when, where, wherefore, whither<i>, and</i> while<i>, or</i> whilst<i>.</i></p>
<p>OBS. 3.--Adverbs of <i>time, place</i>, and <i>manner</i>, are generally connected with verbs or participles; those of <i>degree</i> are more frequently placed before adjectives or adverbs: the latter, however, sometimes denote the measure of actions or effects; as, "And I wept <i>much</i>"--<i>Rev.</i>, v, 4. "And Isaac trembled <i>very exceedingly</i>"--<i>Gen.</i>, xxvii, 33. "Writers who had felt <i>less</i>, would have said <i>more</i>"--<i>Fuller</i>.</p>
<pre>  "Victors and vanquished, in the various field,
   Nor <i>wholly</i> overcome, nor <i>wholly</i> yield."--<i>Dryden</i>.
</pre>
<p>OBS. 4.--The adverbs <i>here, there</i>, and <i>where</i>, when compounded with prepositions, have the force of pronouns, or of pronominal adjectives: as, <i>Hereby</i>, for <i>by this; thereby</i>, for <i>by that</i>; <i>whereby</i>, for <i>by which</i>, or <i>by what</i>. The prepositions which may be subjoined in this manner, are only the short words, <i>at, by, for, from, in, into, of, on, to, unto,</i> under, upon<i>, and</i> with<i>. Compounds of this kind, although they partake of</i> the nature of pronouns with respect to the nouns going before, are still properly reckoned adverbs, because they relate as such to the verbs which follow them; as, "You take my life, when you do take the means <i>whereby</i> I live."--<i>Shak</i>. Here <i>whereby</i> is a conjunctive adverb, representing <i>means</i>, and relating to the verb <i>live</i>.[309] This mode of expression is now somewhat antiquated, though still frequently used by good authors, and especially by the poets.</p>
<p>OBS. 5--The adverbs, <i>when, where, whither, whence, how, why, wherefore,</i> wherein, whereof, whereby<i>, and other like compounds of</i> where<i>, are</i> sometimes used as <i>interrogatives</i>; but, as such, they still severally belong to the classes under which they are placed in the foregoing distribution, except that words of interrogation are not at the same time connectives. These adverbs, and the three pronouns, <i>who, which</i>, and <i>what</i>, are the only interrogative words in the language; but questions may be asked without any of them, and all have other uses than to ask questions.</p>
<p>OBS. 6.--The conjunctive adverbs, <i>when, where, whither, whence, how</i>, and <i>why</i>, are sometimes so employed as to partake of the nature of <i>pronouns</i>, being used as a sort of <i>special relatives</i>, which refer back to antecedent nouns of <i>time, place, manner</i>, or <i>cause</i>, according to their own respective meanings; yet being adverbs, because they relate as such, to the verbs which follow them: as, "In the <i>day when</i> God shall judge the secrets of men."--<i>Rom.</i>, ii, 16. "In a <i>time when</i> thou mayest be found."--<i>Psal.</i>, xxxii, 6. "I sought for some time what I at length found here, a <i>place where</i> all real wants might be easily supplied."--<i>Dr.</i> Johnson<i>. "To that</i> part <i>of the mountain</i> where <i>the declivity began to</i> grow craggy."--<i>Id.</i> "At <i>Canterbury, whither</i> some voice had run before."--<i>Wotton</i>. "Look unto the <i>rock whence</i> ye are hewn, and to the hole of the <i>pit whence</i> ye are digged."--<i>Isaiah</i>, li, 1. "We may remark three different <i>sources whence</i> it arises."--<i>Blair's Rhet.</i>, p. 163. "I'll tell you a <i>way how</i> you may live your time over again."--<i>Collier's</i> Antoninus<i>, p. 108. "A crude account of the</i> method how <i>they perceive</i> truth."--<i>Harris's Hermes</i>, p. 404. "The <i>order how</i> the Psalter is appointed to be read."--<i>Common Prayer</i>. "In the same reasoning we see the <i>cause, why</i> no substantive is susceptible of these comparative degrees."--<i>Hermes</i>, p. 201. "There seems no <i>reason why</i> it should not work prosperously."--<i>Society in America</i>, p. 68. "There are strong <i>reasons why</i> an extension of her territory would be injurious to her."--<i>Ib.</i> "An other <i>reason why</i> it deserved to be more studied."--<i>Blair's Rhet.</i>, p. 123. "The <i>end why</i> God hath ordained faith, is, that his free grace might be glorified."--<i>Goodwin</i>.</p>
<p>OBS. 7.--The direct use of adverbs for pronouns, is often, if not generally, inelegant; and, except the expression may be thereby agreeably shortened, it ought to be considered ungrammatical. The following examples, and perhaps also some of the foregoing, are susceptible of improvement: "Youth is <i>the time, when</i> we are young."--<i>Sanborn's Gram.</i>, p. 120. Say rather, "Youth is <i>that part of life which</i> succeeds to childhood." "The boy gave a satisfactory <i>reason why</i> he was tardy."--<i>Ibid.</i> Say rather, "The boy gave a satisfactory reason <i>for his tardiness</i>." "The several <i>sources from whence</i> these pleasures are derived."--<i>Murray's Key</i>, p. 258. Say rather--"sources from <i>which</i>" "In <i>cases where</i> it is only said, that a question has been asked."--<i>Kirkham's Gram.</i>, p. 117. Say, "In <i>those</i> cases <i>in which</i>." "To the false rhetoric of the <i>age when</i> he lived."--<i>Harris's Hermes</i>, p. 415. Say rather--"of the age <i>in which</i> he lived."</p>
<p>OBS. 8.--When a conjunctive adverb is equivalent to both an antecedent and a relative, the construction seems to be less objectionable, and the brevity of the expression affords an additional reason for preferring it, especially in poetry: as, "But the Son of man hath not <i>where</i> to lay his head."--<i>Matt.</i>, viii, 20. "There might they see <i>whence</i> Po and Ister came."--<i>Hoole's Tasso.</i> "Tell <i>how</i> he formed your shining frame."--<i>Ogilvie.</i> "The wind bloweth <i>where</i> it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell <i>whence</i> it cometh, and <i>whither</i> it goeth."--<i>John</i>, iii, 8. In this construction, the adverb is sometimes preceded by a preposition; the noun being, in fact, <i>understood</i>: as,</p>
<pre>  "Sinks, like a sea-weed, <i>into whence</i> she rose."--<i>Byron.</i>
</pre>
<pre>   "Here Machiavelli's earth return'd <i>to whence</i> it rose."--<i>Id.</i>
</pre>
<p>OBS. 9.--The conjunctive adverb <i>so</i>, very often expresses the sense of some word or phrase going before; as, "Wheresoever the speech is corrupted, <i>so</i> is the mind."--<i>Seneca's Morals</i>, p. 267. That is, the mind is <i>also</i> corrupted<i>. "I consider grandeur and sublimity, as terms synonymous, or</i> nearly <i>so</i>."--<i>Blair's Rhet.</i>, p. 29. The following sentence is grossly wrong, because the import of this adverb was not well observed by the writer: "We have now come to <i>far the most complicated</i> part of speech; and one which is sometimes rendered <i>still more so</i>, than the nature of our language requires."--<i>Nutting's Gram.</i>, p. 38. <i>So</i>, in some instances, repeats the import of a preceding <i>noun</i>, and consequently partakes the nature of a <i>pronoun</i>; as,</p>
<pre>  "We think our fathers <i>fools</i>, so wise we grow;
   Our wiser sons, no doubt, will think us <i>so</i>."--<i>Pope, on Crit.</i>
</pre>
<p>OBS. 10.--"<i>Since</i> is often improperly used for <i>ago</i>: as, 'When were you in France?--Twenty years <i>since</i>.' It ought to be, 'Twenty years <i>ago</i>.' <i>Since</i> may be admitted to supply the place of <i>ago that</i>: it being equally correct to say, 'It is twenty years <i>since</i> I was in France;' and, 'It is twenty years <i>ago, that</i> I was in France.'"--<i>Churchill's Gram.</i>, p. 337. The difference between <i>since</i> and <i>ago</i> is clearly this: the former, being either a preposition or a conjunctive adverb, cannot with strict propriety be used <i>adjectively</i>; the latter, being in reality an old participle, naturally comes after a noun, in the sense of an adjective; as, <i>a year</i> ago, a month ago, a week ago<i>. "</i>Go, ago, ygo, gon, agon, gone, agone<i>, are</i> all used indiscriminately by our old English writers as the past participle of the verb <i>to go</i>."--<i>Tooke's Diversions</i>, Vol. i, p. 376. "Three days <i>agone</i>, I fell sick."--<i>1 Samuel</i>, xxx, 13.</p>
<p><br>
MODIFICATIONS.</p>
<p>Adverbs have no modifications, except that a few are compared, after the manner of adjectives: as, <i>soon, sooner, soonest; often, oftener,</i> oftenest;[310] long, longer, longest; fast, faster, fastest<i>.</i></p>
<p>The following are irregularly compared: <i>well, better, best; badly</i> or <i>ill, worse, worst; little less, least; much, more, most; far, farther,</i> farthest; forth, further, furthest. Rath, rather, rathest<i>, is now used</i> only in the comparative.</p>
<p><br>
OBSERVATIONS.</p>
<p>OBS. 1.--Most adverbs that are formed from adjectives by the addition of <i>ly</i>, will admit the comparative adverbs <i>more and most, less</i> and <i>least</i>, before them:, as, <i>wisely, more wisely, most wisely; culpably, less</i> culpably, least culpably<i>. This is virtually a comparison of the latter</i> adverb, but the grammatical inflection, or degree, belongs only to the former; and the words being written separately, it is certainly most proper to parse them separately, ascribing the degree of comparison to the word which expresses it. As comparison does not belong to adverbs in general, it should not be mentioned in parsing, except in the case of those few which are varied by it.</p>
<p>OBS. 2.--In the works of Milton, and occasionally in those of some other poets of his age,[311] adverbs of two syllables, ending in <i>ly</i>, are not only compared regularly like adjectives of the same ending, but are used in the measure of iambic verse as if they still formed only two syllables. Examples:--</p>
<pre>  "But God hath <i>wiselier</i> arm'd his vengeful ire."
       --<i>P. Lost</i>, B. x, l. 1022.
</pre>
<pre>  "Destroyers <i>rightlier</i> call'd and plagues of men."
       --<i>Ib.</i>, B. xi, l. 699.
</pre>
<pre>  "And on his quest, where <i>likeliest</i> he might find."
       --<i>Ib.</i>, B. ix, l. 414.
</pre>
<pre>  "Now <i>amplier</i> known thy Saviour and thy Lord."
       --<i>Ib.</i>, B. xii, l. 544.
</pre>
<pre>  "Though thou wert <i>firmlier</i> fasten'd than a rock."
       --<i>Sam. Agon.</i>, l. 1398.
</pre>
<pre>  "Not rustic, as before, but <i>seemlier</i> clad."
       --<i>P. Reg.</i>, B. ii, l. 299.
</pre>
<pre>   -------------------------"Whereof to thee anon
   <i>Plainlier</i> shall be reveal'd."
       --<i>Paradise Lost</i>, B. xii, l. 150.
</pre>
<pre>   ------------"To show what coast thy sluggish erare
   Might <i>easiliest</i> harbour in."
       --<i>Shakspeare, Cymb.</i>, Act IV.
</pre>
<pre>  "Shall not myself be <i>kindlier</i> mov'd than thou art?"
       --<i>Id., Tempest</i>, Act V.
</pre>
<pre>  "But <i>earthlier</i> happy is the rose distill'd."
       --<i>Id., M. S. N. Dream</i>, Act I.
</pre>
<p>OBS. 3.--The usage just cited is clearly analogical, and has the obvious advantage of adding to the flexibility of the language, while it also multiplies its distinctive forms. If carried out as it might be, it would furnish to poets and orators an ampler choice of phraseology, and at the same time, obviate in a great measure the necessity of using the same words both adjectively and adverbially. The words which are now commonly used in this twofold character, are principally monosyllables; and, of adjectives, monosyllables are the class which we oftenest compare by <i>er</i> and <i>est</i>: next to which come dissyllables ending in <i>y</i>; as, <i>holy, happy, lovely</i>. But if to any monosyllable we add <i>ly</i> to form an adverb, we have of course a dissyllable ending in <i>y</i>; and if adverbs of this class may be compared regularly, after the manner of adjectives, there can be little or no occasion to use the primitive word otherwise than as an adjective. But, according to present usage, few adverbs are ever compared by inflection, except such words as may also be used adjectively. For example: <i>cleanly,</i> comely, deadly, early, kindly, kingly, likely, lively, princely, seemly, weakly<i>, may all be thus compared; and, according to Johnson and Webster,</i> they may all be used either adjectively or adverbially. Again: <i>late,</i> later, latest<i>, is commonly contrasted in both senses, with</i> early, earlier, earliest<i>; but if</i> lately, latelier, lateliest<i>, were adopted in</i> the adverbial contrast, <i>early</i> and <i>late, earlier</i> and <i>later, earliest</i> and <i>latest</i>, might be contrasted as adjectives only.</p>
<p>OBS. 4.--The using of adjectives for adverbs, is <i>in general</i> a plain violation of grammar. Example: "<i>To</i> is a preposition, governing the verb <i>sell</i>, in the infinitive mood, <i>agreeable</i> to Rule 18, which says, The preposition TO governs the infinitive mood."--<i>Comly's Gram.</i>, p. 137. Here <i>agreeable</i> ought to be <i>agreeably</i>; an adverb, relating to the participle <i>governing</i>. Again, the using of adverbs for adjectives, is a fault as gross. Example: "Apprehending the nominative to be put <i>absolutely.</i>"-- <i>Murray's Gram.</i>, p. 155. Here <i>absolutely</i> ought to be <i>absolute</i>; an adjective, relating to the word <i>nominative</i>. But, <i>in poetry</i>, there is not only a frequent substitution of quality for manner, in such a way that the adjective may still be parsed adjectively; but sometimes also what <i>appears</i> to be (whether right or wrong) a direct use of adjectives for adverbs, especially in the higher degrees of comparison: as,</p>
<pre>  "<i>Firmer</i> he roots him the <i>ruder</i> it blow."
       --<i>Scott, L. of L.</i>, C. ii, st. 19.
</pre>
<pre>   "True ease in writing comes from art, not chance,
   As those move <i>easiest</i> who have learn'd to dance."
       --<i>Pope, Ess. on Crit.</i>
</pre>
<pre>   "And also now the sluggard <i>soundest</i> slept."
       --<i>Pollok, C. of T.</i>, B. vi, l. 257.
</pre>
<pre>   "In them is <i>plainest</i> taught, and <i>easiest</i> learnt,
   What makes a nation happy, and keeps it so."
       --<i>Milton, P. R.</i>, B. iv, l. 361.
</pre>
<p>OBS. 5.--No use of words can be <i>right</i>, that actually confounds the parts of speech; but in many instances, according to present practice, the same words may be used either adjectively or adverbially. <i>Firmer</i> and <i>ruder</i> are not adverbs, but adjectives. In the example above, they may, I think, be ranked with the instances in which quality is poetically substituted for manner, and be parsed as relating to the pronouns which follow them. A similar usage occurs in Latin, and is considered elegant. <i>Easiest</i>, as used above by Pope, may perhaps be parsed upon the same principle; that is, as relating to <i>those</i>, or to <i>persons</i> understood before the verb <i>move</i>. But <i>soundest, plainest</i>, and <i>easiest</i>, as in the latter quotations, cannot be otherwise explained than as being adverbs. <i>Plain</i> and <i>sound</i>, according to our dictionaries, are used both adjectively and adverbially; and, if their superlatives are not misapplied in these instances, it is because the words are adverbs, and regularly compared as such. <i>Easy</i>, though sometimes used adverbially by reputable writers, is presented by our lexicographers as an adjective only; and if the latter are right, Milton's use of <i>easiest</i> in the sense and construction of <i>most easily</i>, must be considered an error in grammar. And besides, according to his own practice, he ought to have preferred <i>plainliest</i> to <i>plainest</i>, in the adverbial sense of <i>most plainly</i>.</p>
<p>OBS. 6.--Beside the instances already mentioned, of words used both adjectively and adverbially, our dictionaries exhibit many primitive terms which are to be referred to the one class or the other, according to their construction; as, <i>soon, late, high, low, quick, slack, hard, soft, wide,</i> close, clear, thick, full, scant, long, short, clean, near, scarce, sure, fast<i>; to which may as well be added,</i> slow, loud<i>, and</i> deep<i>; all</i> susceptible of the regular form of comparison, and all regularly convertible into adverbs in <i>ly</i>; though <i>soonly</i> and <i>longly</i> are now obsolete, and <i>fastly</i>, which means <i>firmly</i>, is seldom used. In short, it is, probably, from an idea, that no adverbs are to be compared by <i>er</i> and <i>est</i> unless the same words may also be used adjectively, that we do not thus compare <i>lately, highly, quickly, loudly</i>, &amp;c., after the example of Milton. But, however custom may sanction the adverbial construction of the foregoing simple terms, the distinctive form of the adverb is in general to be preferred, especially in prose. For example: "The more it was complained of, the <i>louder</i> it was praised."--<i>Daniel Webster, in Congress</i>, 1837. If it would seem quaint to say, "The <i>loudlier</i> it was praised," it would perhaps be better to say, "The <i>more loudly</i> it was praised;" for our critics have not acknowledged <i>loud</i> or <i>louder</i> to be an adverb. Nor have <i>slow</i> and <i>deep</i> been so called. Dr. Johnson cites the following line to illustrate the latter as an <i>adjective</i>:</p>
<pre>  "Drink hellebore, my boy! drink <i>deep</i>, and scour thy brain. DRYDEN."
       --<i>Joh. Dict., w. Deep</i>.
</pre>
<pre>   "Drink hellebore, my boy! drink deep, and <i>purge</i> thy brain."
       --<i>Dryd. IV. Sat. of Persius</i>.
</pre>
<p>OBS. 7.--In some instances, even in prose, it makes little or no difference to the sense, whether we use adjectives referring to the nouns, or adverbs of like import, having reference to the verbs: as, "The whole conception is conveyed <i>clear</i> and <i>strong</i> to the mind."--<i>Blair's Rhet.</i>, p, 138. Here <i>clear</i> and <i>strong</i> are adjectives, referring to <i>conception</i>; but we might as well say, "The whole conception is conveyed <i>clearly</i> and <i>strongly</i> to the mind." "Against a power that exists <i>independent</i> of their own choice."--<i>Webster's Essays</i>, p. 46. Here we might as well say, "exists <i>independently</i>;" for the independence of the power, in whichever way it is expressed, is nothing but <i>the manner</i> of its <i>existence</i>. "This work goeth <i>fast</i> on and prospereth."--<i>Ezra</i>. "Skill comes so <i>slow</i>, and life so <i>fast</i> doth fly."--<i>Davies</i>. Dr. Johnson here takes <i>fast</i> and <i>slow</i> to be adjectives, but he might as well have called them adverbs, so far as their meaning or construction is concerned. For what here qualifies the things spoken of, is nothing but <i>the manner</i> of their <i>motion</i>; and this might as well be expressed by the words, <i>rapidly, slowly, swiftly</i>. Yet it ought to be observed, that this does not prove the equivalent words to be adverbs, and not adjectives. Our philologists have often been led into errors by the argument of equivalence.</p>

CHAPTER IX.--CONJUNCTIONS.</p>
<p>A Conjunction is a word used to connect words or sentences in construction, and to show the dependence of the terms so connected: as, "Thou <i>and</i> he are happy, <i>because</i> you are good."--<i>Murray</i>.</p>
<p><br>
OBSERVATIONS.</p>
<p>OBS. 1.--Our connective words are of four kinds; namely, relative pronouns, conjunctive adverbs,[312] conjunctions, and prepositions. These have a certain resemblance to one another, so far as they are all of them <i>connectives</i>; yet there are also characteristical differences by which they may in general be easily distinguished. Relative pronouns represent antecedents, and stand in those relations which we call cases; conjunctive adverbs assume the connective power in addition to their adverbial character, and consequently sustain a double relation; conjunctions, (except the introductory correspondents,) join words or sentences together, showing their relation either to each other or to something else; prepositions, though naturally subject themselves to something going before, assume the government of the terms which follow them, and in this they differ from all the rest.</p>
<p>OBS. 2.--Conjunctions do not express any of the real objects of the understanding, whether things, qualities, or actions, but rather the several modes of connexion or contrast under which these objects are contemplated. Hence conjunctions were said by Aristotle and his followers to be in themselves "devoid of signification;" a notion which Harris, with no great propriety, has adopted in his faulty definition[313] of this part of speech. It is the office of this class of particles, to link together words, phrases, or sentences, that would otherwise appear as loose shreds, or unconnected aphorisms; and thus, by various forms of dependence, to give to discourse such continuity as may fit it to convey a connected train of thought or reasoning. The skill or inability of a writer may as strikingly appear in his management of these little connectives, as in that of the longest and most significant words in the language.</p>
<pre>  "The current is often evinced by the straws,
   And the course of the wind by the flight of a feather;
   So a speaker is known by his <i>ands</i> and his <i>ors</i>,
   Those stitches that fasten his patchwork together."--<i>Robert F. Mott</i>.
</pre>
<p>OBS. 3.--Conjunctions sometimes connect entire sentences, and sometimes particular words or phrases only. When one whole sentence is closely linked with an other, both become clauses or members of a more complex sentence; and when one word or phrase is coupled with an other, both have in general a common dependence upon some other word in the same sentence. In etymological parsing, it may be sufficient to name the conjunction as such, and repeat the definition above; but, in syntactical parsing, the learner should always specify the terms connected. In many instances, however, he may conveniently abbreviate his explanation, by parsing the conjunction as connecting "what precedes and what follows;" or, if the terms are transposed, as connecting its own clause to the second, to the third, or to some other clause in the context.</p>
<p>OBS. 4.--However easy it may appear, for even the young parser to <i>name the</i> terms <i>which in any given instance are connected by the conjunction, and of</i> course to know for himself <i>what these terms are</i>,--that is, to know what the conjunction does or does not, connect,--it is certain that a multitude of grammarians and philosophers, great and small, from Aristotle down to the latest modifier of Murray, or borrower from his text, have been constantly contradicting one an other, if not themselves, in relation to this matter. Harris avers, that "the Conjunction connects, <i>not Words, but</i> Sentences<i>;" and frames his definition accordingly. See</i> Hermes<i>, p. 237.</i> This doctrine is true of some of the conjunctions, but it is by no means true of them all. He adds, in a note, "Grammarians have usually considered the Conjunction as connecting rather single Parts of Speech, than whole Sentences, and that too with the addition of like with like, Tense with Tense, Number with Number, Case with Case, &amp;c. This <i>Sanctius</i> justly explodes."--<i>Ib.</i>, p. 238. If such has been the usual doctrine of the grammarians, they have erred on the one side, as much as our philosopher, and his learned authorities, on the other. For, in this instance, Harris's quotations of Latin and Greek writers, prove only that Sanctius, Scaliger, Apollonius, and Aristotle, held the same error that he himself had adopted;--the error which Latham and others now inculcate, that, "There are always <i>two propositions</i> where there is one Conjunction."--<i>Fowler's E.</i> Gram.<i>, 8vo, 1850, p. 557.</i></p>
<p>OBS. 5.--The common doctrine of L. Murray and others, that, "Conjunctions connect the same moods and tenses of verbs, and cases of nouns and pronouns," is not only badly expressed, but is pointedly at variance with their previous doctrine, that, "Conjunctions very often unite sentences, when they appear to unite only words; as in the following instances: 'Duty <i>and</i> interest forbid vicious indulgences;' 'Wisdom <i>or</i> folly governs us.' Each of these forms of expression," they absurdly say, "contains two sentences."--<i>Murray's Gram.</i>, p. 124; <i>Smith's</i>, 95; <i>Fisk's</i>, 84; <i>Ingersoll's</i>, 81. By "<i>the same moods, tenses</i>, or <i>cases</i>," we must needs here understand some <i>one mood, tense</i>, or <i>case</i>, in which the connected words <i>agree</i>; and, if the conjunction has any thing to do with this agreement, or sameness of mood, tense, or case, it must be because words only, and not sentences, are connected by it. Now, <i>if, that, though, lest,</i> unless<i>, or any other conjunction that introduces the subjunctive, will</i> almost always be found to connect different moods, or rather to subjoin one sentence to another in which there is a different mood. On the contrary, <i>and, as, even, than, or</i>, and <i>nor</i>, though they may be used to connect sentences, do, in very many instances, connect words only; as, "The <i>king</i> and queen <i>are an amiable pair."--</i>Murray. <i>"And a being of</i> more than human <i>dignity stood before me."--</i>Dr. Johnson. <i>It cannot be plausibly</i> pretended, that <i>and</i> and <i>than</i>, in these two examples, connect clauses or sentences. So <i>and</i> and <i>or</i>, in the examples above, connect the nouns only, and not "sentences:" else our common rules for the agreement of verbs or pronouns with words connected, are nothing but bald absurdities. It is idle to say, that the construction and meaning are not <i>what they appear to</i> be<i>; and it is certainly absurd to contend, that conjunctions always</i> connect sentences; or always, words only. One author very strangely conceives, that, "Conjunctions may be said either always to connect words only, or always to connect sentences, <i>according to the view which may be</i> taken of them <i>in analyzing."--</i>Nutting's Gram.<i>, p. 77.</i></p>
<p>OBS. 6.--"Several words belonging to other parts of speech, are occasionally used as conjunctions. Such are the following: <i>provided,</i> except<i>, verbs;</i> both<i>, an adjective;</i> either, neither, that<i>, pronouns;</i> <i>being, seeing</i>, participles; <i>before, since, for</i>, prepositions. I will do it, <i>provided</i> you lend some help. Here <i>provided</i> is a conjunction, that connects the two sentences. 'Paul said, <i>Except</i> these abide in the ship, ye cannot be saved.' Here <i>except</i> is a conjunction. <i>Excepting</i> is also used as a participle and conjunction. '<i>Being</i> this reception of the gospel was so anciently foretold.'--<i>Bishop Pearson.</i> '<i>Seeing</i> all the congregation are holy.'--<i>Bible</i>. Here <i>being</i> and <i>seeing</i> are used as conjunctions."--<i>Alexander's Gram</i>:, p. 50. 'The foregoing remark, though worthy of some attention, is not altogether accurate. <i>Before</i>, when it connects sentences, is not a conjunction, but a conjunctive adverb. <i>Provided</i>, as cited above, resembles not the verb, but the perfect participle. <i>Either</i> and <i>neither</i>, when they are not conjunctions, are pronominal adjectives, rather than pronouns. And, to say, that, "words <i>belonging to other parts of speech</i>, are used as <i>conjunctions</i>," is a sort of solecism, which leaves the learner in doubt to what class they <i>really</i> belong. <i>Being</i>, and <i>being that</i>, were formerly used in the sense of <i>because, since, or seeing that</i>; (Lat. <i>cum, quoniam</i>, or <i>quando</i>;) but this usage is now obsolete. So there is an uncommon or obsolete use of <i>without</i>, in the sense of <i>unless</i>, or <i>except</i>; (Lat. <i>nisi</i>;) as, "He cannot rise <i>without</i> he be helped." <i>Walker's Particles</i>, p. 425. "Non potest <i>nisi</i> adjutus exsurgere."--<i>Seneca.</i></p>
<p><br>
CLASSES.</p>
<p>Conjunctions are divided into two general classes, <i>copulative</i> and <i>disjunctive</i>; and a few of each class are particularly distinguished from the rest, as being <i>corresponsive</i>.</p>
<p>I. A <i>copulative conjunction</i> is a conjunction that denotes an addition, a cause, a consequence, or a supposition: as, "He <i>and</i> I shall not dispute; <i>for, if</i> he has any choice, I shall readily grant it."</p>
<p>II. A <i>disjunctive conjunction</i> is a conjunction that denotes opposition of meaning: as, "<i>Though</i> he were dead, <i>yet</i> shall he live."--<i>St. John's</i> Gospel<i>. "Be not faithless,</i> but <i>believing."--</i>Id.</p>
<p>III. The <i>corresponsive conjunctions</i> are those which are used in pairs, so that one refers or answers to the other: as, "John came <i>neither</i> eating <i>nor</i> drinking."--<i>Matt.</i>, xi, 18. "But <i>if</i> I cast out devils by the Spirit of God, <i>then</i> the kingdom of God is come unto you."--<i>Ib.</i>, xii, 28.</p>
<p>OBS.--Not all terms which stand in the relation of correspondents, or corresponsives, are therefore to be reckoned <i>conjunctions</i>; nor are both words in each pair always of the same part of speech: some are adverbs; one or two are adjectives; and sometimes a conjunction answers to a preceding adverb. But, if a word is seen to be the mere precursor, index, introductory sign, or counterpart, of a conjunction, and has no relation or import which should fix it in any other of the ten classes called parts of speech, it is, clearly, a conjunction,--a <i>corresponding</i> or <i>corresponsive</i> conjunction. It is a word used <i>preparatively</i>, "to connect words or sentences in construction, and to show the dependence of the terms so connected."</p>
<p><br>
LIST OF THE CONJUNCTIONS.</p>
<p>1. The Copulatives; <i>And, as, both, because, even, for, if, that, then,</i> since, seeing, so<i>.</i></p>
<p>2. The Disjunctives; <i>Or, nor, either, neither, than, though, although,</i> yet, but, except, whether, lest, unless, save, provided, notwithstanding, whereas<i>.</i></p>
<p>3. The Corresponsives; <i>Both--and; as--as; as--so; if--then; either--or</i>; <i>neither--nor; whether--or; though</i>, or <i>although--yet</i>.</p>
<p><br>
OBSERVATIONS.</p>
<p>OBS. 1.--By some writers, the words, <i>also, since, too, then, therefore</i>, and <i>wherefore</i>, are placed among the copulative conjunctions; and <i>as, so,</i> still, however<i>, and</i> albeit<i>, among the disjunctive; but Johnson and</i> Webster have marked most of these terms as <i>adverbs</i> only. It is perhaps of little moment, by which name they are called; for, in some instances, conjunctions and conjunctive adverbs do not differ very essentially. <i>As,</i> so, even, then, yet<i>, and</i> but<i>, seem to belong sometimes to the one part</i> of speech, and sometimes to the other. I call them adverbs when they chiefly express time, manner, or degree; and conjunctions when they appear to be mere connectives. <i>As, yet</i>, and <i>but</i>, are generally conjunctions; but <i>so, even</i>, and <i>then</i>, are almost always adverbs. <i>Seeing</i> and <i>provided</i>, when used as connectives, are more properly conjunctions than any thing else; though Johnson ranks them with the adverbs, and Webster, by supposing many awkward ellipses, keeps them with the participles. Examples: "For these are not drunken, as ye suppose, <i>seeing</i> it is but the third hour of the day."--<i>Acts</i>, ii, 15. "The senate shall have power to adjourn themselves, <i>provided</i> such adjournment shall not exceed two days at a time."--<i>Constitution of New Hampshire</i>.</p>
<p>OBS. 2.--<i>Since</i>, when it governs a noun after it, is a preposition: as, "Hast thou commanded the morning <i>since thy days</i>?"--<i>Job</i>. <i>Albeit</i> is equivalent in sense to <i>although</i>, and is properly a conjunction; but this old compound is now nearly or quite obsolete. <i>As</i> is sometimes a relative pronoun, sometimes a conjunctive adverb, and sometimes a copulative conjunction. Example of the last: "We present ourselves <i>as</i> petitioners." If <i>as</i> is ever disjunctive, it is not so here; nor can we parse it as an adverb, because it comes between two words that are essentially in apposition. The equivalent Latin term <i>quasi</i> is called an adverb, but, in such a case, not very properly: as, "Et colles <i>quasi</i> pulverem pones;"--"And thou shalt make the hills <i>as</i> chaff."--<i>Isaiah</i>, xli, 15. So <i>even</i>, which in English is frequently a sign of emphatic repetition, seems sometimes to be rather a conjunction than an adverb: as, "I, <i>even</i> I, am the Lord."--<i>Isaiah</i>, xliii, 11.</p>
<p>OBS. 3.--<i>Save</i> and <i>saving</i>, when they denote exception, are not adverbs, as Johnson denominates them, or a verb and a participle, as Webster supposes them to be, or prepositions, as Covell esteems them, but disjunctive conjunctions; and, as such, they take the same case after as before them; as, "All the conspirators, <i>save</i> only <i>he</i>, did that they did, in envy of great Cæsar."--<i>Shak.</i> "All this world's glory seemeth vain, and all their shows but shadows, <i>saving she</i>."--<i>Spenser</i>. "Israel burned none of them, <i>save Hazor</i> only."--<i>Joshua</i>. xi, 13. "And none of them was cleansed, <i>saving Naaman</i> the Syrian."--<i>Luke</i>, iv, 27. <i>Save</i> is not here a transitive verb, for Hazor was not <i>saved</i> in any sense, but utterly destroyed; nor is Naaman here spoken of as <i>being saved by an other</i> leper<i>, but as being cleansed when others were not. These two conjunctions</i> are now little used; and therefore the propriety of setting the nominative after them and treating them as conjunctions, is the more apt to be doubted. The Rev. Matt. Harrison, after citing five examples, four of which have the nominative with <i>save</i>, adds, without naming the part of speech, or assigning any reason, this decision, which I think erroneous: "In all these passages, <i>save</i> requires after it the objective case." His five examples are these: "All, <i>save</i> I, were at rest, and enjoyment."-- <i>Frankenstein</i>. "There was no stranger with us, in the house, <i>save we</i> two."--<i>1 Kings</i>, iii, 18.</p>
<pre>  "And nothing wanting is, <i>save she</i>, alas!"
       --DRUMMOND <i>of Hawthornden</i>.
</pre>
<pre>   "When all slept sound, <i>save she</i>, who bore them both."
       --ROGERS, <i>Italy</i>, p. 108.
</pre>
<pre>   "And all were gone, <i>save him</i>, who now kept guard."
       --<i>Ibid.</i>, p. 185.
</pre>
<p>OBS. 4.--The conjunction <i>if</i> is sometimes used in the Bible to express, not a supposition of what follows it, but an emphatic negation: as, "I have sworn in my wrath, <i>if</i> they shall enter into my rest."--<i>Heb.</i>, iv, 3. That is, <i>that they shall not enter</i>. The same peculiarity is found in the Greek text, and also in the Latin, and other versions. <i>Or</i>, in the obsolete phrase, "<i>or ever</i>," is not properly a conjunction, but a conjunctive adverb of time, meaning <i>before</i>. It is supposed to be a corruption of <i>ere</i>: as, "I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, <i>or ever</i> the earth was."--<i>Prov.</i>, viii, 23. "And we, <i>or ever</i> he come near, are ready to kill him."--<i>Acts</i>, xxiii, 15. This term derives no support from the original text.</p>
<p>OBS. 5.--There are some peculiar phrases, or combinations of words, which have the force of conjunctions, and which it is not very easy to analyze satisfactorily in parsing: as, "And <i>for all</i> there were so many, yet was not the net broken."--<i>John</i>, xxi, 11. Here <i>for all</i> is equivalent to <i>although</i>, or <i>notwithstanding</i>; either of which words would have been more elegant. <i>Nevertheless</i> is composed of three words, and is usually reckoned a conjunctive adverb; but it might as well be called a disjunctive conjunction, for it is obviously equivalent to <i>yet, but</i>, or <i>notwithstanding</i>; as, "I am crucified with Christ: <i>nevertheless</i> I live; <i>yet not</i> I, <i>but</i> Christ liveth in me."--<i>Gal.</i>, ii, 20. Here, for <i>nevertheless</i> and <i>but</i>, we have in the Greek the same particle [Greek: de]. "Each man's mind has some peculiarity, <i>as well as</i> his face."--<i>Locke</i>. "Relative pronouns, <i>as well as</i> conjunctions, serve to connect sentences."--<i>Murray's Gram.</i>, p. 124. Here the first <i>as</i> corresponds to the second, but <i>well</i> not being used in the literal sense of an adverb, some judicious grammarians take the whole phrase as a conjunction. It is, however, susceptible of division: as, "It is adorned with admirable pieces of sculpture, <i>as well</i> modern <i>as</i> ancient."--<i>Addison</i>.</p>
<p>OBS. 6.--So the phrases, <i>for as much as, in as much as, in so much that</i>, if taken collectively, have the nature of conjunctions; yet they contain within themselves correspondent terms and several different parts of speech. The words are sometimes printed separately, and sometimes partly together. Of late years, <i>forasmuch, inasmuch, insomuch</i>, have been usually compounded, and called adverbs. They might as well, perhaps, be called conjunctions, as they were by some of our old grammarians; for two conjunctions sometimes come together: as, "Answering their questions, <i>as</i> if<i>[314] it were a matter that needed it."--</i>Locke<i>. "These should be at</i> first gently treated, <i>as though</i> we expected an imposthumation,"--<i>Sharp</i>. "But there are many things which we must acknowledge to be true, <i>notwithstanding that</i> we cannot comprehend them."--<i>Beattie's Moral</i> Science<i>, p. 211. "There is no difference,</i> except that <i>some are heavier</i> than others."--"We may be playful, <i>and yet</i> innocent; grave, <i>and yet</i> corrupt."--<i>Murray's Key</i>, p. 166.</p>
<p>OBS. 7.--Conjunctions have no grammatical modifications, and are consequently incapable of any formal agreement or disagreement with other words; yet their import as connectives, copulative or disjunctive, must be carefully observed, lest we write or speak them improperly. Example of error: "Prepositions are <i>generally set before</i> nouns <i>and</i> pronouns."--<i>Wilbur's Gram.</i>, p. 20. Here <i>and</i> should be <i>or</i>; because, although a preposition usually governs a noun <i>or</i> a pronoun, it seldom governs both at once. And besides, the assertion above seems very naturally to mean, that nouns and pronouns <i>are generally preceded</i> by prepositions--as gross an error as dullness could invent! L. Murray also says of prepositions: "They are, <i>for the most</i> part, put before nouns <i>and</i> pronouns."--<i>Gram.</i>, p. 117. So Felton: "They generally stand before nouns <i>and</i> pronouns."--<i>Analytic and Prac. Gram.</i>, p. 61. The blunder however came originally from Lowth, and out of the following admirable enigma: "Prepositions, <i>standing by themselves in construction</i>, are put before nouns <i>and</i> pronouns; <i>and</i> sometimes after verbs; but <i>in this sort</i> of composition <i>they are</i> chiefly prefixed <i>to verbs: as,</i> to outgo, to overcome<i>."--</i>Lowth's Gram.<i>, p. 66.</i></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>OBS. 8.--The opposition suggested by the disjunctive particle <i>or</i>, is sometimes merely nominal, or verbal: as, "That object is a triangle, <i>or</i> figure contained under three right lines."--<i>Harris</i>. "So if we say, that figure is a sphere, <i>or</i> a globe, <i>or</i> a ball."--<i>Id., Hermes</i>, p. 258. In these cases, the disjunction consists in nothing but an alternative of words; for the terms connected describe or name the same thing. For this sense of <i>or</i>, the Latins had a peculiar particle, <i>sive</i>, which they called <i>Subdisjunctiva</i>, a <i>Subdisjunctive</i>: as, "Alexander <i>sive</i> Paris; Mars <i>sive</i> Mavors."--<i>Harris's Hermes</i>, p. 258. In English, the conjunction <i>or</i> is very frequently equivocal: as, "They were both more ancient than Zoroaster <i>or</i> Zerdusht."--<i>Campbell's Rhet.</i>, p. 250; <i>Murray's Gram.</i>, p. 297. Here, if the reader does not happen to know that <i>Zoroaster</i> and <i>Zerdusht</i> mean the same person, he will be very likely to mistake the sense. To avoid this ambiguity, we substitute, (in judicial proceedings,) the Latin adverb <i>alias, otherwise</i>; using it as a conjunction subdisjunctive, in lieu of <i>or</i>, or the Latin <i>sive</i>: as, "Alexander, <i>alias</i> Ellick."--"Simson, <i>alias</i> Smith, <i>alias</i> Baker."--<i>Johnson's Dict.</i></p>

<p>"In all gratifications, disgust ever lies nearest to the highest pleasures; and therefore let us not marvel, if this is peculiarly the case in eloquence. By glancing at either poets or orators, we may easily satisfy ourselves, that neither a poem nor an oration which aims continually at what is fine, showy, and sparkling, can please us long. Wherefore, though we may wish for the frequent praise of having expressed ourselves well and properly, we should not covet repeated applause for being bright and splendid."--CICERO, <i>de Oratore</i>.</p>
<p>"The foundation of eloquence, as well as of every other high attainment, is practical wisdom. For it happens in oratory, as in life, that nothing is more difficult, than to discern what is proper and becoming. Through lack of such discernment, gross faults are very often committed. For neither to all ranks, fortunes, and ages, nor to every time, place, and auditory, can the same style either of language or of sentiment be adapted. In every part of a discourse, as in every part of life, we must consider what is suitable and decent; and this must be determined with reference both to the matter in question, and to the personal character of those who speak and those who hear."--CICERO, <i>Orator ad Brutum</i>.</p>

<p>"In a thought, generally speaking, there is at least one capital object considered as acting or as suffering. This object is expressed by a substantive noun: its action is expressed by an active verb; and the thing affected by the action is expressed by an other substantive noun: its suffering, or passive state, is expressed by a passive verb; and the thing that acts upon it, by a substantive noun. Beside these, which are the capital parts of a sentence, or period, there are generally underparts; each of the substantives, as well as the verb, may be qualified: time, place, purpose, motive, means, instrument, and a thousand other circumstances, may be necessary to complete the thought."--<i>Kames, El. of</i> Crit.<i>, ii, 34.</i></p>

But, according to Observation 7th, on the Classes of Conjunctions, "The import of connectives, copulative or disjunctive, must be carefully observed, lest we write or speak them improperly." In this instance, <i>or</i> should be changed to <i>a</i>; thus, "A <i>Verb</i> is so called from the Latin <i>verbum, a word</i>" that is, "which means, <i>a word</i>."]</p>

CHAPTER X.--PREPOSITIONS.</p>
<p>A Preposition is a word used to express some relation of different things or thoughts to each other, and is generally placed before a noun or a pronoun: as, "The paper lies <i>before</i> me <i>on</i> the desk."</p>
<p><br>
OBSERVATIONS.</p>
<p>OBS. 1.--The relations of things to things in nature, or of words to words in discourse, are infinite in number, if not also in variety. But just classification may make even infinites the subjects of sure science. Every <i>relation</i> of course implies more objects, and more terms, than one; for any one thing, considered merely in itself, is taken independently, abstractly, irrelatively, as if it had no relation or dependence. In all correct language, the grammatical relation of the <i>words</i> corresponds exactly to the relation of the <i>things</i> or <i>ideas</i> expressed; for the relation of words, is their dependence, or connexion, <i>according to the</i> sense. <i>This relation is oftentimes immediate, as of one word to an other,</i> without the intervention of a preposition; but it is seldom, if ever, reciprocally equal; because dependence implies subordination; and mere adjunction is a sort of inferiority.</p>
<p>OBS. 2.--To a preposition, the <i>prior</i> or <i>antecedent</i> term may be a noun, an adjective, a pronoun, a verb, a participle, or an adverb; and the <i>subsequent</i> or <i>governed</i> term may be a noun, a pronoun, a pronominal adjective, an infinitive verb, or a participle. In some instances, also, as in the phrases, <i>in vain, on high, at once, till now, for ever, by how</i> much, until then, from thence, from above<i>, we find adjectives used</i> elliptically, and adverbs substantively, after the preposition. But, in phrases of an adverbial character, what is elsewhere a preposition often becomes an adverb. Now, if prepositions are concerned in expressing the various relations of so many of the different parts of speech, multiplied, as these relations must be, by that endless variety of combinations which may be given to the terms; and if the sense of the writer or speaker is necessarily mistaken, as often as any of these relations are misunderstood, or their terms misconceived; how shall we estimate the importance of a right explanation, and a right use, of this part of speech?</p>
<p>OBS. 3.--The grammarian whom Lowth compliments, as excelling all others, in "acuteness of investigation, perspicuity of explication, and elegance of method;" and as surpassing all but Aristotle, in the beauty and perfectness of his philological analysis; commences his chapter on conjunctions in the following manner: "Connectives are the subject of what follows; which, <i>according</i> as they connect <i>either Sentences or Words</i>, are called by the different <i>Names</i> of <i>Conjunctions</i> OR <i>Prepositions.</i> Of these Names, that of the Preposition is taken from a <i>mere accident</i>, as <i>it</i> commonly stands in connection before <i>the Part, which it connects.</i> The name of the Conjunction, as is evident, has reference to its essential character. Of these two we shall consider the Conjunction <i>first</i>, because it connects, <i>not Words</i>, but Sentences."--<i>Harris's Hermes</i>, p. 237.</p>
<p>OBS. 4.--In point of order, it is not amiss to treat conjunctions before prepositions; though this is not the method of Lowth, or of Murray. But, to any one who is well acquainted with these two parts of speech, the foregoing passage cannot but appear, in three sentences out of the four, both defective in style and erroneous in doctrine. It is true, that conjunctions generally connect sentences, and that prepositions as generally express relations between particular words: but it is true also, that conjunctions <i>often</i> connect words only; and that prepositions, by governing antecedents, relatives, or even personal pronouns, may serve to subjoin sentences to sentences, as well as to determine the relation and construction of the particular words which they govern. Example: "The path seems now plain and even, <i>but</i> there are asperities and pitfalls, <i>over</i> which <i>Religion only can conduct you."--</i>Dr. Johnson. <i>Here are three</i> simple sentences, which are made members of one compound sentence, by means of <i>but</i> and <i>over which</i>; while two of these members, clauses, or subdivisions, contain particular words connected by <i>and.</i></p>
<p>OBS. 5.--In one respect, the preposition is the <i>simplest</i> of all the parts of speech: in our common schemes of grammar, it has neither classes nor modifications. Every connective word that governs an object after it, is called a preposition, <i>because it does so</i>; and in etymological parsing, to name the preposition as such, and define the name, is, perhaps, all that is necessary. But in syntactical parsing, in which we are to omit the definitions, and state the construction, we ought to explain what terms the preposition connects, and to give a rule adapted to this office of the particle. It is a palpable defect in nearly all our grammars, that their syntax contains NO SUCH RULE. "Prepositions govern the objective case," is a rule for <i>the objective case</i>, and not for the syntax of <i>prepositions.</i> "Prepositions show the relations of words, and of the things or thoughts expressed by them," is the principle for the latter; a principle which we cannot neglect, without a shameful lameness in our interpretation;--that is, when we pretend to parse syntactically.</p>
<p>OBS. 6.--Prepositions and their objects very often precede the words on which they depend, and sometimes at a great distance. Of this we have an example, at the opening of Milton's Paradise Lost; where "<i>Of</i>," the first word, depends upon "<i>Sing</i>," in the sixth line below; for the meaning is--"<i>Sing of man's first disobedience</i>," &amp;c. To find the terms of the relation, is to find the <i>meaning</i> of the passage; a very useful exercise, provided the words have a meaning which is worth knowing. The following text has for centuries afforded ground of dispute, because it is doubtful in the original, as well as in many of the versions, whether the preposition <i>in</i> (i. e., "<i>in the regeneration</i>") refers back to <i>have followed</i>, or forward to the last verb <i>shall sit</i>: "Verily I say unto you that ye who have followed me, <i>in</i> the regeneration, when the Son of man shall sit <i>in</i> the throne of his glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel."--<i>Matt.</i>, xix, 28. The second <i>in</i> is manifestly wrong: the Greek word is [Greek: epi], <i>on</i> or <i>upon</i>; i. e., "<i>upon</i> the throne of his glory."</p>
<p>OBS. 7.--The prepositions have, from their own nature, or from custom, such an <i>adaptation</i> to particular terms and relations, that they can seldom be used one for an other without manifest impropriety. Example of error: "Proper seasons should be allotted <i>for</i> retirement."--<i>Murray's Key</i>, p. 173. We do not say "<i>allotted for</i>," but "<i>allotted to</i>:" hence <i>for</i> is either wrong in itself or misplaced. Such errors always vex an intelligent reader. He sees the terms mismatched, the intended connection doubtful, the sense obscured, and wishes the author could have valued his own meaning enough to have made it intelligible;--that is, (to speak technically,) enough to have made it a certain clew to his syntax. We can neither parse nor correct what we do not understand. Did the writer mean, "Proper seasons should be <i>allotted to</i> retirement?"--or, "Proper <i>seasons for</i> retirement should be allotted?"--or, "Seasons <i>proper for</i> retirement should be alloted?" [sic--KTH] Every expression is incorrigibly bad, the meaning of which cannot be known. Expression? Nay, expression it is not, but only a mock utterance or an abortive attempt at expression.</p>
<p>OBS. 8.--Harris observes, in substance, though in other words, that almost all the prepositions were originally formed to denote relations of place; that this class of relations is primary, being that which natural bodies maintain at all times one to an other; that in the continuity of place these bodies form the universe, or visible whole; that we have some prepositions to denote the <i>contiguous</i> relation of bodies, and others for the <i>detached</i> relation; and that both have, by <i>degrees</i>, been extended from local relations, to the relations of subjects incorporeal. He appears also to assume, that, in such examples as the following,--"Caius <i>walketh</i> with <i>a staff; "--"The statue</i> stood upon <i>a pedestal;"--"The river</i> ran over <i>a sand;"--"He</i> is going <i>to Turkey;"--"The sun</i> is risen <i>above the</i> hills;"--"These figs <i>came from</i> Turkey;"--the antecedent term of the relation is not the verb, but the noun or pronoun before it. See <i>Hermes</i>, pp. 266 and 267. Now the true antecedent is, unquestionably, that word which, in the order of the sense, the preposition should immediately follow: and a verb, a participle, or an adjective, may sustain this relation, just as well as a substantive. "<i>The man spoke of colour</i>," does not mean, "<i>The man of colour spoke</i>;" nor does, "<i>The member from Delaware</i> replied<i>," mean, "</i>The member replied from Delaware<i>"</i></p>
<p>OBS. 9.--To make this matter more clear, it may be proper to observe further, that what I call the order of the sense, is not always that order of the words which is fittest to express the sense of a whole period; and that the true antecedent is that word to which the preposition, and its object would naturally be subjoined, were there nothing to interfere with such an arrangement. In practice it often happens, that the preposition and its object cannot be placed immediately after the word on which they depend, and which they would naturally follow. For example: "She hates the means <i>by which</i> she lives." That is, "She hates the means which she <i>lives</i> by<i>." Here we cannot say, "She hates the means she</i> lives by which<i>;" and</i> yet, in regard to the preposition <i>by</i>, this is really the order of the sense. Again: "Though thou shouldest bray a fool <i>in a mortar among wheat</i> with a pestle<i>, yet will not his foolishness depart from him."--</i>Prov.<i>,</i> xxvii, 23. Here is no transposition to affect our understanding of the prepositions, yet there is a liability to error, because the words which immediately precede some of them, are not their true antecedents: the text does not really speak of "<i>a mortar among wheat</i>" or of "<i>wheat with a</i> pestle<i>." To what then are the</i> mortar<i>, the</i> wheat<i>, and the</i> pestle<i>, to</i> be mentally subjoined? If all of them, to any one thing, it must be to the <i>action</i> suggested by the verb <i>bray</i>, and not to its object <i>fool</i>; for the text does not speak of "<i>a fool with a pestle</i>," though it does <i>seem</i> to speak of "<i>a fool in a mortar</i>, and <i>among wheat</i>." Indeed, in this instance, as in many others, the verb and its object are so closely associated that it makes but little difference in regard to the sense, whether you take both of them together, or either of them separately, as the antecedent to the preposition. But, as the instrument of an action is with the agent rather than with the object, if you will have the substantives alone for antecedents, the natural order of the sense must be supposed to be this: "Though <i>thou with</i> a pestle shouldest bray a, <i>fool</i> in <i>a mortar [and]</i> among <i>wheat, yet will not his</i> foolishness from <i>him</i> depart." This gives to each of the prepositions an antecedent different from that which I should assign. Sanborn observes, "There seem to be <i>two</i> kinds <i>of relation expressed by prepositions,--an</i> existing <i>and a</i> <i>connecting</i> relation."--<i>Analyt. Gram.</i>, p. 225. The latter, he adds, "<i>is</i> the most important<i>."--</i>Ib.<i>, p. 226. But it is the former that admits</i> nothing but <i>nouns</i> for antecedents. Others besides Harris may have adopted this notion, but I have never been one of the number, though a certain author scruples not to charge the error upon me. See <i>O. B Peirce's Gram.</i>, p. 165.</p>
<p>OBS. 10.--It is a very common error among grammarians, and the source of innumerable discrepancies in doctrine, as well as one of the chief means of maintaining their interminable disputes, that they suppose <i>ellipses</i> at their own pleasure, and supply in every given instance just what words their fancies may suggest. In this work, I adopt for myself, and also recommend to others, the contrary course of avoiding on all occasions the supposition of any <i>needless</i> ellipses. Not only may the same preposition govern more than one object, but there may also be more than one antecedent word, bearing a joint relation to that which is governed by the preposition. (1.) Examples of joint objects: "There is an inseparable connection BETWEEN <i>piety and virtue</i>."--<i>Murray's Key</i>, 8vo, p. 171. "In the conduct of Parmenio, a mixture OF <i>wisdom and folly</i> was very conspicuous."--<i>Ib.</i>, p. 178. "True happiness is an enemy TO <i>pomp and</i> noise<i>"--</i>Ib.<i>, p. 171. (2.) Examples of joint antecedents: "In unity</i> consist the <i>welfare and security</i> OF every society."--<i>Ib.</i>, p. 182. "It is our duty to be <i>just and kind</i> TO our fellow--creatures, and to be <i>pious and faithful</i> TO Him that made us."--<i>Ib.</i>, p. 181. If the author did not mean to speak of being <i>pious to God</i> as well as <i>faithful to Him</i>, he has written incorrectly: a comma after <i>pious</i>, would alter both the sense and the construction. So the text, "For I am meek, and lowly in heart," is commonly perverted in our Bibles, for want of a comma after <i>meek</i>. The Saviour did not say, he was <i>meek in heart</i>: the Greek may be <i>very literally</i> rendered thus: "For gentle am I, and humble in heart."</p>
<p>OBS. 11.--Many writers seem to suppose, that no preposition can govern more than one object. Thus L. Murray, and his followers: "The ellipsis of the <i>preposition</i>, as well as of the verb, is seen in the following instances: 'He went into the abbeys, halls, and public buildings;' that is, 'He went into the abbeys, he went into the halls, and he went into the public buildings.'--'He also went through all the streets, and lanes of the city;' that is, 'Through all the streets, and through all the lanes,' &amp;c."--<i>Murray's Gram.</i>, 8vo, p. 219. See the same interpretations in <i>Ingersoll's Gram.</i>, p. 155; <i>Merchant's</i>, 100; <i>Picket's</i>, 211; <i>Alger's</i>, 73; <i>Fish's</i>, 147; <i>Guy's</i>, 91; <i>Adams's</i>, 82; <i>R. C. Smith's</i>, 183; <i>Hamlin's</i>, 105; <i>Putnam's</i>, 139; <i>Weld's</i>, 292. Now it is plain, that in neither of these examples is there any such ellipsis at all. Of the three prepositions, the first governs three nouns; the second, two; and the third, one only. But the last, (which is <i>of</i>,) has two antecedents, <i>streets</i> and <i>lanes</i>, the comma after <i>streets</i> being wrong; for the author does not speak of all the streets in the world, but of <i>all the</i> streets and lanes <i>of a particular city. Dr. Ash has the same example</i> without the comma, and supposes it only an ellipsis of the preposition <i>through</i>, and even that supposition is absurd. He also furnished the former example, to show an ellipsis, not of the verb <i>went</i>, but only of the preposition <i>into</i>; and in this too he was utterly wrong. See <i>Ash's</i> Gram.<i>, p. 100. Bicknell also, whose grammar appeared five years before</i> Murray's, confessedly copied the same examples from Ash; and repeated, not the verb and its nominative, but only the prepositions <i>through</i> and <i>into</i>, agreeably to Ash's erroneous notion. See his <i>Grammatical Wreath</i>, Part i, p. 124. Again the principles of Murray's supposed ellipses, are as inconsistent with each other, as they are severally absurd. Had the author explained the second example according to his notion of the first, he should have made it to mean, <b>He also went <i>through all the streets</i> of</b> the city<i>, and</i> he also went <i>through all the lanes</i> of the city<i>.' What a</i> pretty idea is this for a principle of grammar! And what a multitude of admirers are pretending to carry it out in parsing! One of the latest writers on grammar says, that, "<i>Between him and me</i>" signifies, "<i>Between</i> him, and between me<i>!"--</i>Wright's Philosophical Gram.<i>, p. 206. And an</i> other absurdly resolves a simple sentence into a compound one, thus: "'There was a difficulty between John, and his brother.' That is, there was a difficulty between John, and <i>there was a difficulty between</i> his brother."--<i>James Brown's English Syntax</i>, p. 127; and again, p. 130.</p>
<p>OBS. 12.--Two prepositions are not unfrequently connected by a conjunction, and that for different purposes, thus: (1.) To express two different relations at once; as, "The picture of my travels <i>in and around</i> Michigan."--<i>Society in America</i>, i, 231. (2.) To suggest an alternative in the relation affirmed; as, "The action will be fully accomplished <i>at or</i> before <i>the time."--</i>Murray's Gram.<i>, i, 72. Again: "The First Future Tense</i> represents the action as yet to come, <i>either with or without</i> respect to the precise time."--<i>Ib.</i>; and <i>Felton's Gram.</i>, p. 23. <i>With</i> and <i>without</i> being direct opposites, this alternative is a thing of course, and the phrase is an idle truism. (3.) To express two relations so as to affirm the one and deny the other; as, "Captain, yourself are the fittest to live and reign not <i>over</i>, but next and immediately <i>under</i> the people."--<i>Dryden</i>. Here, perhaps, "<i>the people</i>" may be understood after <i>over</i>. (4.) To suggest a mere alternative of words; as, "NEGATIVELY, adv. <i>With or by</i> denial."--<i>Webster's Dict.</i> (5.) To add a similar word, for aid or force; as, "Hence adverbs of time were necessary, <i>over and above</i> the tenses."--See <i>Murray's Gram.</i>, p. 116. "To take effect <i>from and</i> after <i>the first day of May."--</i>Newspaper<i>.</i></p>
<p>OBS. 13.--In some instances, two prepositions come directly together, so as jointly to express a sort of compound relation between what precedes the one and what follows the other: as, "And they shall sever the wicked <i>from</i> among <i>the just."--</i>Matt.<i>, xiii, 49. "Moses brought out all the rods</i> from before <i>the Lord."--</i>Numb.<i>, xvii, 9. "Come out</i> from among <i>them."--</i>2 Cor.<i>, vi, 17. "From Judea, and</i> from beyond <i>Jordan."--</i>Matt<i>. iv, 25.</i> "Nor a lawgiver <i>from between</i> his feet."--<i>Gen.</i>, xlix, 10. Thus the preposition <i>from</i>, being itself adapted to the ideas of motion and separation, easily coincides with any preposition of place, to express this sort of relation; the terms however have a limited application, being used only between <i>a verb</i> and <i>a noun</i>, because the relation itself is between <i>motion</i> and <i>the place</i> of its beginning: as, "The sand <i>slided from</i> beneath <i>my feet."--</i>Dr. Johnson<i>. In this manner, we may form</i> complex prepositions <i>beginning with</i> from<i>, to the number</i> of about <i>thirty; as,</i> <i>from amidst, from around, from before, from behind</i>, &amp;c. Besides these, there are several others, of a more questionable character, which are sometimes referred to the same class; as, <i>according to, as to, as for,</i> because of, instead of, off of, out of, over against<i>, and</i> round about<i>.</i> Most or all of these are sometimes resolved in a different way, upon the assumption that the former word is an adverb; yet we occasionally find some of them compounded by the hyphen: as, "Pompey's lieutenants, Afranius and Petreius, who lay <i>over-against</i> him, decamp suddenly."--<i>Rowe's Lucan</i>, Argument to B. iv. But the common fashion is, to write them separately; as, "One thing is set <i>over against</i> an other."--<i>Bible</i>.</p>
<p>OBS. 14.--It is not easy to fix a principle by which prepositions may in all cases be distinguished from adverbs. The latter, we say, do not govern the objective case; and if we add, that the former do <i>severally</i> require some object after them, it is clear that any word which precedes a preposition, must needs be something else than a preposition. But this destroys all the doctrine of the preceding paragraph, and admits of no such thing as a <i>complex preposition</i>; whereas that doctrine is acknowledged, to some extent or other, by every one of our grammarians, not excepting even those whose counter-assertions leave no room for it. Under these circumstances, I see no better way, than to refer the student to the definitions of these parts of speech, to exhibit examples in all needful variety, and then let him judge for himself what disposition ought to be made of those words which different grammarians parse differently.</p>
<p>OBS. 15.--If our prepositions were to be divided into classes, the most useful distinction would be, to divide them into <i>Single</i> and <i>Double</i>. The distinction which some writers make, who divide them into "<i>Separable</i> and <i>Inseparable</i>," is of no use at all in parsing, because the latter are mere syllables; and the idea of S. R. Hall, who divides them into "<i>Possessive</i> and <i>Relative</i>," is positively absurd; for he can show us only <i>one</i> of the former kind, and that one, (the word <i>of</i>,) is not always such. A <i>Double</i> Preposition<i>, if such a thing is admissible, is one that consists of two</i> words which in syntactical parsing must be taken together, because they jointly express the relation between two other terms; as, "The waters were dried up <i>from off</i> the earth."--<i>Gen.</i>, viii, 13. "The clergy kept this charge <i>from off</i> us."--<i>Leslie, on Tithes</i>, p. 221. "Confidence in an unfaithful man in time of trouble, is like a broken tooth, and a foot <i>out</i> of <i>joint."--</i>Prov.<i>, xxv, 19. "The beam</i> out of <i>the timber shall answer</i> it."--<i>Hab.</i>, ii, 11. <i>Off</i> and <i>out</i> are most commonly adverbs, but neither of them can be called an adverb here.</p>
<p>OBS. 16.--Again, if <i>according to</i> or <i>as to</i> is a preposition, then is <i>according</i> or <i>as</i> a preposition also, although it does not of itself govern the objective case. <i>As</i>, thus used, is called a conjunction by some, an adverb by others. Dr. Webster considers <i>according</i> to be always a participle, and expressly says, "It is never a preposition."--<i>Octavo</i> Dict. <i>The following is an instance in which, if it is not a preposition,</i> it is a participle: "This is a construction <i>not according</i> to the rules of grammar."--<i>Murray's Gram.</i>, Vol. ii, p. 22. But <i>according to</i> and <i>contrary to</i> are expressed in Latin and Greek by single prepositions; and if <i>to</i> alone is the preposition in English, then both <i>according</i> and <i>contrary</i> must, in many instances, be <i>adverbs</i>. Example: "For dost thou sit as judging me <i>according to</i> the law, and <i>contrary</i> to law command me to be smitten?" (See the Greek of Acts, xxiii, 3.) <i>Contrary</i>, though literally an adjective, is often made either an adverb, or a part of a complex preposition, unless the grammarians are generally in error respecting it: as, "Ha dares not act <i>contrary to</i> his instructions."-- <i>Murray's Key</i>, p. 179.</p>
<p>OBS. 17.--J. W. Wright, with some appearance of analogy on his side, but none of usage, everywhere adds <i>ly</i> to the questionable word <i>according</i>; as, "We are usually estimated <i>accordingly to</i> our company."-- <i>Philosophical Gram.</i>, p. 127. "<i>Accordingly to</i> the forms in which they are employed."--<i>Ib.</i>, p. 137. "<i>Accordingly to</i> the above principles, the <i>adjective</i> ACCORDING (or <i>agreeable</i>) is frequently, but improperly, substituted for the adverb ACCORDINGLY (or <i>agreeably</i>.)"--<i>Ib.</i>, p. 145. The word <i>contrary</i> he does not notice; but, on the same principle, he would doubtless say, "He dares not act <i>contrarily</i> to his instructions." We say indeed, "He acted <i>agreeably</i> to his instructions;"--and not, "He acted <i>agreeable</i> to his instructions." It must also be admitted, that the adverbs <i>accordingly</i> and <i>contrarily</i> are both of them good English words. If these were adopted, where the character of <i>according</i> and <i>contrary</i> is disputable, there would indeed be no longer any occasion to call these latter either adverbs or prepositions. But the fact is, that <i>no good</i> writers have yet preferred them<i>, in such phrases; and the adverbial ending</i> <i>ly</i> gives an additional syllable to a word that seems already quite too long.</p>
<p>OBS. 18.--<i>Instead</i> is reckoned an adverb by some, a preposition by others; and a few write <i>instead-of</i> with a needless hyphen. The best way of settling the grammatical question respecting this term, is, to write the noun <i>stead</i> as a separate word, governed by <i>in</i>. Bating the respect that is due to anomalous usage, there would be more propriety in compounding <i>in</i> quest of, in lieu of<i>, and many similar phrases. For</i> stead <i>is not always</i> followed by <i>of</i>, nor always preceded by <i>in</i>, nor always made part of a compound. We say, <i>in our stead, in your stead, in their stead</i>, &amp;c.; but <i>lieu</i>, which has the same meaning as <i>stead</i>, is much more limited in construction. Examples: "In <i>the stead</i> of sinners, He, a divine and human person, suffered."--<i>Barnes's Notes</i>. "Christ suffered in <i>the place</i> and <i>stead</i> of sinners."--<i>Ib.</i> "<i>For</i>, in its primary sense, is <i>pro, loco</i> alterius<i>, in</i> the stead <i>or</i> place <i>of</i> another<i>."--</i>Lowth's Gram.<i>, p.</i> 65.</p>
<pre>  "If it may stand him more in <i>stead</i> to lie."
       --<i>Milt., P. L.</i>, B. i, l. 473.
</pre>
<pre>   "But here thy sword can do thee little <i>stead</i>."
       --<i>Id., Comus</i>, l. 611.
</pre>
<p>OBS. 19.--<i>From forth</i> and <i>from out</i> are two poetical phrases, apparently synonymous, in which there is a fanciful transposition of the terms, and perhaps a change of <i>forth</i> and <i>out</i> from adverbs to prepositions. Each phrase is equivalent in meaning to <i>out of</i> or <i>out from. Forth</i>, under other circumstances, is never a preposition; though <i>out</i>, perhaps, may be. We speak as familiarly of going <i>out doors</i>, as of going <i>up stairs</i>, or <i>down cellar</i>. Hence <i>from out</i> may be parsed as a complex preposition, though the other phrase should seem to be a mere example of hyperbaton:</p>
<pre>  "I saw <i>from out</i> the wave her structures rise."--<i>Byron</i>.
</pre>
<pre>   "Peeping <i>from forth</i> their alleys green."--<i>Collins</i>.
</pre>
<p>OBS. 20.--"<i>Out of</i> and <i>as to</i>," says one grammarian, "are properly prepositions, although they are double words. They may be called <i>compound</i> prepositions."--<i>Cooper's Gram.</i>, p. 103. I have called the <i>complex</i> prepositions <i>double</i> rather than <i>compound</i>, because several of the single prepositions are compound words; as, <i>into, notwithstanding, overthwart,</i> throughout, upon, within, without<i>. And even some of these may follow the</i> preposition <i>from</i>; as, "If he shall have removed <i>from within</i> the limits of this state." But <i>in</i> and <i>to, up</i> and <i>on, with</i> and <i>in</i>, are not always compounded when they come together, because the sense may positively demand that the former be taken as an adverb, and the latter only as a preposition: as, "I will come <i>in to</i> him, and will sup with him."--<i>Rev.</i>, iii, 20. "A statue of Venus was set <i>up on</i> Mount Calvary."--<i>M'Ilvaine's</i> Lectures<i>, p. 332. "The troubles which we meet</i> with in <i>the</i> world."--<i>Blair</i>. And even two prepositions may be brought together without union or coalescence; because the object of the first one may be expressed or understood <i>before</i> it: as, "The man whom you spoke <i>within</i> the street;"--"The treatment you complain <i>of on</i> this occasion;"--"The house that you live <i>in in</i> the summer;"--"Such a dress as she had <i>on in</i> the evening."</p>
<p>OBS. 21.--Some grammarians assume, that, "Two prepositions in immediate succession require a noun to be <i>understood</i> between them; as, 'Hard by, a cottage chimney smokes, <i>From betwixt</i> two aged oaks.'--'The mingling notes came softened <i>from below</i>.'"--<i>Nutting's Gram.</i>, p. 105. This author would probably understand here--"From <i>the space</i> betwixt two aged oaks;"--"came softened from <i>the region</i> below <i>us</i>." But he did not consider all the examples that are included in his proposition; nor did he rightly regard even those which he cites. The doctrine will be found a very awkward one in practice; and an other objection to it is, that most of the ellipses which it supposes, are entirely imaginary. If there were truth in his assumption, the compounding of prepositions would be positively precluded. The terms <i>over-against</i> and <i>round-about</i> are sometimes written with the hyphen, and perhaps it would be well if all the complex prepositions were regularly compounded; but, as I before suggested, such is not the present fashion of writing them, and the general usage is not to be controlled by what any individual may think.</p>
<p>OBS. 22.--Instances may, doubtless, occur, in which the object of a preposition is suppressed by ellipsis, when an other preposition follows, so as to bring together two that do not denote a compound relation, and do not, in any wise, form one complex preposition. Of such suppression, the following is an example; and, I think, a double one: "They take pronouns <i>after instead of before</i> them."--<i>Fowler, E. Gram.</i>, §521. This may be interpreted to mean, and probably does mean--"They take pronouns after <i>them</i> in <i>stead</i> of <i>taking them</i> before them."</p>
<p>OBS. 23.--In some instances, the words <i>in, on, of, for, to, with</i>, and others commonly reckoned prepositions, are used after infinitives or participles, in a sort of <i>adverbial</i> construction, because they do not govern any objective; yet not exactly in the usual sense of adverbs, because they evidently express the relation between the verb or participle and a nominative or objective going before. Examples: "Houses are built to live <i>in</i>, and not to look <i>on</i>; therefore let use be preferred before uniformity, except where both may be had."--<i>Ld. Kames</i>. "These are not mysteries for ordinary readers to be let <i>into</i>."--ADDISON: <i>Joh. Dict., w.</i> Let. <i>"Heaven is worth dying</i> for<i>, though earth is not worth living</i> <i>for</i>."--<i>R. Hall</i>. "What! have ye not houses to eat and to drink <i>in</i>?"--<i>1 Cor.</i>, xi, 22. This is a very peculiar idiom of our language; and if we say, "Have ye not houses <i>in which</i> to eat and to drink?" we form <i>an other</i> which is not much less so. Greek: "[Greek: Mæ gar oikias ouk echete eis to esthiein kai pinein];" Latin: "Num enim domos non habetis ad manducandum et bibendum?"--<i>Leusden</i>. "N'avez vous pas des maisons pour manger et pour boire?"--<i>French Bible</i>.[315]</p>
<p>OBS. 24.--In OBS. 10th, of Chapter Fourth, on Adjectives, it was shown that words of <i>place</i>, (such as, <i>above, below, beneath, under</i>, and the like,) are sometimes set before nouns in the character of adjectives, and not of prepositions: as, "In the <i>above</i> list,"--"From the <i>above</i> list."--<i>Bullions', E. Gram.</i>, p. 70. To the class of adjectives also, rather than to that of adverbs, may some such words be referred, when, without governing the objective case, they are put <i>after</i> nouns to signify place: as, "The <i>way</i> of life is <i>above</i> to the wise, that he may depart from <i>hell beneath</i>."--<i>Prov.</i>, xv, 24. "Of any thing that is in <i>heaven</i> above<i>, or that is in the</i> earth beneath<i>."--</i>Exod.<i>, xx, 4.</i></p>
<pre>  "Say first, of <i>God above</i> or <i>man below</i>,
   What can we reason but from what we know?"--<i>Pope</i>.
</pre>

LIST OF THE PREPOSITIONS.</p>
<p>The following are the principal prepositions, arranged alphabetically: <i>Aboard, about, above, across, after, against,</i> along, amid <i>or</i> amidst, among <i>or</i> amongst, around, at, athwart;--Bating, before, behind, below, beneath, beside or besides, between <i>or</i> betwixt, beyond, by;--Concerning;--Down, during;--Ere, except, excepting;--For, from;--In, into;--Mid <i>or</i> midst;--Notwithstanding;--Of, off,[316] on, out, over, overthwart;--Past, pending;--Regarding, respecting, round;--Since;--Through, throughout, till, to, touching, toward <i>or</i> <i>towards;--Under, underneath, until, unto, up, upon;--With, within,</i> without<i>.</i></p>
<p><br>
OBSERVATIONS.</p>
<p>OBS. 1.--Grammarians differ considerably in their tables of the English prepositions. Nor are they all of one opinion, concerning either the characteristics of this part of speech, or the particular instances in which the acknowledged properties of a preposition are to be found. Some teach that, "Every preposition requires an <i>objective case</i> after it."--<i>Lennie</i>, p. 50; <i>Bullions, Prin. of E. Gram.</i>, p. 69. In opposition to this, I suppose that the preposition <i>to</i> may take an <i>infinitive verb</i> after it; that <i>about</i> also may be a preposition, in the phrase, "<i>about to</i> write<i>;" that</i> about, above, after, against, by, for, from, in, of<i>, and</i> some other prepositions, may govern <i>participles</i>, as such; (i. e. without making them nouns, or cases;) and, lastly, that after a preposition an <i>adverb</i> is sometimes construed substantively, and yet is indeclinable; as, <i>for once, from afar, from above, at unawares</i>.</p>
<p>OBS. 2.--The writers just quoted, proceed to say: "When a <i>preposition does</i> not govern <i>an objective case, it becomes an adverb; as, 'He rides</i> <i>about</i>.' But in such phrases as, <i>cast up, hold out, fall on</i>, the words <i>up, out</i>, and <i>on</i>, must be considered as <i>a part</i> of the <i>verb</i>, rather than as prepositions or adverbs."--<i>Lennie's Prin. of E. Gram.</i>, p. 50; <i>Bullions's</i>, p. 59; <i>his Analyt. and P. Gram.</i>, p. 109. Both these sentences are erroneous: the one, more particularly so, in expression; the other, in doctrine. As the preposition is chiefly distinguished by its regimen, it is absurd to speak of it as governing nothing; yet it does not always govern the objective case, for participles and infinitives have no cases. <i>About, up, out</i>, and <i>on</i>, as here cited, are all of them <i>adverbs</i>; and so are all other particles that thus qualify verbs, without governing any thing. L. Murray grossly errs when ha assumes that, "The distinct component parts of such phrases as, <i>to cast up, to fall on, to</i> bear oat, to give over, &amp;c.<i>, are</i> no guide <i>to the sense of the whole."</i> Surely, "to cast <i>up</i>" is to cast <i>somehow</i>, though the meaning of the phrase may be "<i>to compute</i>." By this author, and some others, all <i>such</i> adverbs <i>are absurdly called</i> prepositions<i>, and are also as absurdly</i> declared to be <i>parts</i> of the preceding verbs! See <i>Murray's Gram.</i>, p. 117; <i>W. Allen's</i>, 179; <i>Kirkham's</i>, 95; <i>R. G. Smith's</i>, 93; <i>Fisk's</i>, 86; <i>Butler's</i>, 63; <i>Wells's</i>, 146.</p>
<p>OBS. 3--In comparing the different English grammars now in use, we often find the primary distinction of the parts of speech, and every thing that depends upon it, greatly perplexed by the <i>fancied ellipses</i>, and <i>forced</i> constructions<i>, to which their authors resort. Thus Kirkham: "Prepositions</i> are sometimes erroneously called adverbs, when their nouns are understood. 'He rides <i>about</i>;' that is, about the <i>town, country</i>, or <i>something</i> else. 'She was <i>near</i> [the <i>act</i> or <i>misfortune</i> of] falling;' 'But do not <i>after</i> [that <i>time</i> or <i>event</i>] lay the blame on me.' 'He came <i>down</i> [the <i>ascent</i>] from the hill;' 'They lifted him <i>up</i> [the <i>ascent</i>] out of the pit.' 'The angels <i>above</i>;'--above <i>us</i>--'Above these lower <i>heavens</i>, to us invisible, or dimly seen.'"--<i>Gram.</i>, p. 89. The errors of this passage are almost as numerous as the words; and those to which the doctrine leads are absolutely innumerable. That <i>up</i> and <i>down</i>, with verbs of motion, imply ascent and descent, as <i>wisely</i> and <i>foolishly</i> imply wisdom and folly, is not to be denied; but the grammatical bathos of coming "<i>down</i> [the ascent] from the hill" of science<i>, should startle those whose faces</i> are directed upward! <i>Downward ascent</i> is a movement worthy only of Kirkham, and his Irish rival, Joseph W. Wright. The <i>brackets</i> here used are Kirkham's, not mine.</p>
<p>OBS. 4.--"Some of the <i>prepositions</i>," says L. Murray, "have the <i>appearance and effect</i> of conjunctions: as, '<i>After</i> their prisons were thrown open,' &amp;c. '<i>Before</i> I die;' 'They made haste to be prepared <i>against</i> their friends arrived:' but if the noun <i>time</i>, which is <i>understood</i>, be added, they will lose their <i>conjunctive form</i>: as, 'After [<i>the time when</i>] their prisons,' &amp;c."--<i>Octavo Gram.</i>, p. 119. Here, <i>after, before</i>, and <i>against</i>, are neither conjunctions nor prepositions, but conjunctive <i>adverbs of time</i>, referring to the verbs which follow them, and also, when the sentences are completed, to others antecedent. The awkward addition of "<i>the time when</i>," is a sheer perversion. If <i>after,</i> before<i>, and the like, can ever be adverbs, they are so here, and not</i> conjunctions, or prepositions.</p>
<p>OBS. 5.--But the great Compiler proceeds: "The <i>prepositions, after,</i> before, above, beneath<i>, and several others, sometimes</i> appear to be adverbs<i>, and may be</i> so considered<i>: as, 'They had their reward soon</i> <i>after</i>;' 'He died not long <i>before</i>;' 'He dwells <i>above</i>;' but if the nouns <i>time</i> and <i>place</i> be added, they will lose their adverbial form: as, 'He died not long <i>before that time</i>,' &amp;c."--<i>Ib.</i> Now, I say, when any of the foregoing words "<i>appear</i> to be adverbs," they <i>are</i> adverbs, and, if adverbs, then not prepositions. But to consider prepositions to be adverbs, as Murray here does, or seems to do; and to suppose "the NOUNS <i>time</i> AND <i>place</i>" to be understood in the several examples here cited, as he also does, or seems to do; are singly such absurdities as no grammarian should fail to detect, and together such a knot of blunders, as ought to be wondered at, even in the Compiler's humblest copyist. In the following text, there is neither preposition nor ellipsis:</p>
<pre>  "Above, below, without, within, around,
   Confus'd, unnumber'd multitudes are found."--<i>Pope, on Fame</i>.
</pre>
<p>OBS. 6.--It comports with the name and design of this work, which is a broad synopsis of grammatical criticism, to notice here one other absurdity; namely, the doctrine of "<i>sentential nouns</i>." There is something of this in several late grammars: as, "The prepositions, after, before, ere, since, till, and until, frequently govern <i>sentential</i> nouns; and after, before, since, notwithstanding, and some others, frequently govern a noun or pronoun <i>understood</i>. A preposition governing a sentential noun, is, by Murray and others, considered a <i>conjunction</i>; and a preposition governing a noun understood, an <i>adverb</i>."--J. L. PARKHURST: <i>in Sanborn's</i> Gram.<i>, p. 123. "Example: 'He will,</i> before he dies<i>, sway the sceptre.'</i> <i>He dies</i> is a sentential noun, third person, singular number; and is governed by <i>before</i>; <i>before he dies</i>, being equivalent in meaning to <i>before his death</i>."--<i>Sanborn, Gram.</i>, p. 176. "'<i>After they had waited</i> a long time, they departed.' After <i>waiting</i>."--<i>Ib.</i> This last solution supposes the phrase, "<i>waiting a long time</i>," or at least the participle <i>waiting</i>, to be a <i>noun</i>; for, upon the author's principle of equivalence, "<i>they had waited</i>," will otherwise be a "<i>sentential</i>" <i>participle</i>--a thing however as good and as classical as the other!</p>
<p>OBS. 7.--If a preposition can ever be justly said to take a sentence for its object, it is chiefly in certain ancient expressions, like the following: "For <i>in that</i> he died, he died unto sin once; but <i>in that</i> he liveth, he liveth unto God."--<i>Rom.</i>, vi, 10. "My Spirit shall not always strive with man, <i>for that</i> he also is flesh."--<i>Gen.</i>, vi, 3. "For, <i>after</i> that<i>, in the wisdom of God, the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased</i> God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe."--<i>1 Cor.</i>, i, 21. Here, <i>in, for</i>, and <i>after</i>, are all followed by the word <i>that</i>; which Tooke, Webster, Frazee, and some others, will have to be "a substitute," or "pronoun," representing the sentence which follows it, and governed by the preposition. But <i>that</i>, in this sense, is usually, and perhaps more properly, reckoned a conjunction. And if we take it so, <i>in,</i> for<i>, and</i> after<i>, (unless the latter be an adverb,) must either be</i> reckoned conjunctions also, or be supposed to govern sentences. The expressions however are little used; because "<i>in that</i>" is nearly equivalent to <i>as</i>; "<i>for that</i>" can be better expressed by <i>because</i>; and "<i>after that</i>," which is equivalent to [Greek: epeide], <i>postquam</i>, may well be rendered by the term, <i>seeing that</i>, or <i>since</i>. "<i>Before that</i> Philip called thee," is a similar example; but "<i>that</i>" is here needless, and "<i>before</i>" may be parsed as a conjunctive adverb of time. I have one example more: "But, <i>besides that</i> he attempted it formerly with no success, it is certain the Venetians keep too watchful an eye," &amp;c.--<i>Addison</i>. This is good English, but the word "<i>besides</i>" if it be not a conjunction, may as well be called an adverb, as a preposition.</p>
<p>OBS. 8.--There are but few words in the list of prepositions, that are not sometimes used as being of some other part of speech. Thus <i>bating,</i> excepting, concerning, touching, respecting, during, pending<i>, and a part</i> of the compound <i>notwithstanding</i>, are literally participles; and some writers, in opposition to general custom, refer them always to their original class. Unlike most other prepositions, they do not refer to <i>place</i>, but rather to <i>action, state</i>, or <i>duration</i>; for, even as prepositions, they are still allied to participles. Yet to suppose them always participles, as would Dr. Webster and some others, is impracticable. Examples: "They speak <i>concerning</i> virtue."--<i>Bullions, Prin. of E. Gram.</i>, p. 69. Here <i>concerning</i> cannot be a participle, because its antecedent term is a <i>verb</i>, and the meaning is, "they <i>speak</i> of virtue." "They are bound <i>during life</i>." that is, <i>durante vitâ</i>, life continuing, or, as long as life lasts. So, "<i>Notwithstanding this</i>," i.e., "<i>hoc non obstante</i>," this not hindering. Here the nature of the construction seems to depend on the order of the words. "Since he had succeeded, <i>notwithstanding them</i>, peaceably to the throne."--<i>Bolingbroke, on Hist.</i>, p. 31. "This is a correct English idiom, Dr. Lowth's <i>criticism</i>, to the contrary <i>notwithstanding</i>."--<i>Webster's Improved Gram.</i>, p. 85. In the phrase, "<i>notwithstanding them</i>," the former word is clearly a preposition governing the latter; but Dr. Webster doubtless supposed the word "<i>criticism</i>" to be in the nominative case, put absolute with the participle: and so it would have been, had he written <i>not withstanding</i> as two words, like "<i>non obstante</i>;" but the compound word <i>notwithstanding</i> is not a participle, because there is no verb <i>to notwithstand</i>. But <i>notwithstanding</i>, when placed before a nominative, or before the conjunction <i>that</i>, is a conjunction, and, as such, must be rendered in Latin by <i>tamen</i>, yet, <i>quamvis</i>, although, or <i>nihilominus</i>, nevertheless.</p>
<p>OBS. 9.--<i>For</i>, when it signifies <i>because</i>, is a conjunction: as, "Boast not thyself of to-morrow; <i>for</i> thou knowest not what a day may bring forth."--<i>Prov.</i>, xxvii, 1. <i>For</i> has this meaning, and, according to Dr. Johnson, is a conjunction, when it precedes <i>that</i>; as, "Yet <i>for that</i> the worst men are most ready to remove, I would wish them chosen by discretion of wise men."--<i>Spenser.</i> The phrase, as I have before suggested, is almost obsolete; but Murray, in one place, adopts it from Dr. Beattie: "For <i>that</i> those parts of the verb are not properly called tenses."--<i>Octavo Gram.</i>, p. 75. How he would have parsed it, does not appear. But both words are connectives. And, from the analogy of those terms which serve as links to other terms, I should incline to take <i>for that, in that, after that</i>, and <i>besides that</i>, (in which a known conjunction is put last,) as complex conjunctions; and also, to take <i>as for, as to</i>, and <i>because of</i>, (in which a known preposition is put last,) as complex prepositions. But there are other regular and equivalent expressions that ought in general to be preferred to any or all of these.</p>
<p>OBS. 10.--Several words besides those contained in the list above, are (or have been) occasionally employed in English as prepositions: as, <i>A</i>, (chiefly used before participles,) <i>abaft, adown, afore, aloft, aloof,</i> alongside, anear, aneath, anent, aslant, aslope, astride, atween, atwixt, besouth, bywest, cross, dehors, despite, inside, left-hand, maugre, minus, onto, opposite, outside, per, plus, sans, spite, thorough, traverse, versus, via, withal, withinside<i>.</i></p>
<p>OBS. 11.--Dr. Lowth says, "The particle <i>a</i> before participles, in the phrases <i>a</i> coming, <i>a</i> going, <i>a</i> walking, <i>a</i> shooting, &amp;c. and before nouns, as <i>a</i>-bed, <i>a</i>-board, <i>a</i>-shore, <i>a</i>-foot, &amp;c. seems to be <i>a true</i> and genuine preposition<i>, a little disguised by familiar use and quick</i> pronunciation. Dr. Wallis supposes it to be the preposition <i>at</i>. I rather think it is the preposition <i>on</i>."--<i>Lowth's Gram.</i>, p. 65; <i>Churchill's</i>, 268. There is no need of supposing it to be either. It is not from <i>on</i>; for in Saxon it sometimes accompanied <i>on</i>: as in the phrase, "<i>on á</i> weoruld<i>;" that is, "</i>on to ages<i>;" or, as Wickliffe rendered it, "</i>into worldis<i>;" or, as our version has it, "</i>for ever<i>." See</i> Luke<i>, i, 55. This</i> preposition was in use long before either <i>a</i> or <i>an</i>, as an article, appeared in its present form in the language; and, for ought I can discover, it may be as old as either <i>on</i> or <i>at</i>. <i>An</i>, too, is found to have had at times the sense and construction of <i>in</i> or <i>on</i>; and this usage is, beyond doubt, older than that which makes it an article. <i>On</i>, however, was an exceedingly common preposition in Saxon, being used almost always where we now put <i>on, in, into, upon</i>, or <i>among</i>, and sometimes, for <i>with</i> or <i>by</i>; so, sometimes, where <i>a</i> was afterwards used: thus, "What in the Saxon Gospel of John, is, 'Ic wylle gan <i>on</i> fixoth,' is, in the English version, 'I go <i>a</i> fishing.' Chap, xxi, ver. 3." See <i>Lowth's</i> Gram.<i>, p. 65;</i> Churchill's<i>, 269. And</i> a <i>is now sometimes equivalent to</i> <i>on</i>; as, "He would have a learned University make Barbarisms a purpose."--<i>Bentley, Diss. on Phalaris</i>, p. 223. That is,--"<i>on</i> purpose." How absurdly then do some grammarians interpret the foregoing text!--"I go <i>on</i> a fishing."--<i>Alden's Gram.</i>, p. 117. "I go <i>on</i> a fishing voyage or business."--<i>Murray's Gram.</i>, p. 221; <i>Merchant's</i>, 101. "It may not be improper," says Churchill in another place, "to observe here, that the preposition <i>on</i>, is too frequently pronounced as if it were the vowel <i>a</i>, in ordinary conversation; and this corruption <i>is</i> [has] become so prevalent, that I have even met with 'laid it <i>a oneside'</i> in a periodical publication. It should have been '<i>on one side</i>,' if the expression were meant to be particular; '<i>aside</i>,' if general."--<i>New Gram.</i>, p. 345. By these writers, <i>a</i> is also supposed to be sometimes a corruption of <i>of</i>: as, "Much in the same manner, Thomas <i>of</i> Becket, by very frequent and familiar use, became Thomas <i>à</i> Becket; and one <i>of the</i> clock, or perhaps <i>on the</i> clock, is written one o'clock, but pronounced one <i>a</i> clock. The phrases with <i>a</i> before a participle are out of use in the solemn style; but still prevail in familiar discourse. They are established by long usage, and good authority; and there seems to be no reason, why they should be utterly rejected."--<i>Lowth's Gram.</i>, p. 66. "Much in the same manner, John <i>of</i> Nokes, and John <i>of</i> Styles, become John <i>a</i> Nokes, and John <i>a</i> Styles: and one <i>of the</i> clock, or rather <i>on the</i> clock, is written one <i>o'</i>clock, but pronounced one <i>a</i> clock. The phrases with a before participles, are out of use in the solemn style; but still prevail in familiar discourse."--<i>Churchill's New Gram.</i>, p. 269.</p>

<p><br>
OBS. 15.--<i>Minus</i>, less, <i>plus</i>, more, <i>per</i>, by, <i>versus</i>, towards, or against, and <i>viâ</i>, by the way of, are Latin words; and it is not very consistent with the <i>purity</i> of our tongue, to use them as above. <i>Sans</i>, without, is French, and not now heard with us. <i>Afore</i> for <i>before, atween</i> for <i>between, traverse</i> for <i>across, thorough</i> for <i>through</i>, and <i>withal</i> for <i>with</i>, are obsolete. <i>Withal</i> was never placed before its object, but was once very common at the end of a sentence. I think it not properly a preposition, but rather an adverb. It occurs in Shakspeare, and so does <i>sans</i>; as,</p>
<pre>  "I did laugh, <i>sans</i> intermission, an hour by his dial."

EXAMPLES FOR PARSING.</p>
<p>PRAXIS X.--ETYMOLOGICAL.</p>
<p><i>In the Tenth Praxis, it is required of the pupil--to distinguish and</i> define the different parts of speech, and the classes and modifications of the <i>ARTICLES, NOUNS, ADJECTIVES, PRONOUNS, VERBS, PARTICIPLES, ADVERBS,</i> CONJUNCTIONS, <i>and</i> PREPOSITIONS.</p>
<p><i>The definitions to be given in the Tenth Praxis, are, two for an article,</i> six for a noun, three for an adjective, six for a pronoun, seven for a verb finite, five for an infinitive, two for a participle, two (and sometimes three) for an adverb, two for a conjunction, one for a preposition, and one for an interjection.

LESSON I.--PARSING.</p>
<p>"My Lord, I do here, in the name of all the learned and polite persons of the nation, complain to your Lordship, as first minister, that our language is imperfect; that its daily improvements are by no means in proportion to its daily corruptions; that the pretenders to polish and refine it, have chiefly multiplied abuses and absurdities; and that, in many instances, it offends against every part of grammar."--<i>Dean Swift, to the Earl of</i> Oxford<i>.</i></p>
<p>"Swift must be allowed to have been a good judge of this matter; to which he was himself very attentive, both in his own writings, and in his remarks upon those of his friends: He is one of the most correct, and perhaps [he is] the best, of our prose writers. Indeed the justness of this complaint, <i>as</i> far as I can find, <i>hath</i> never yet been questioned; and yet no effectual method <i>hath</i> hitherto been taken to redress the grievance which was the object of it."--<i>Lowth's Gram.</i>, p. iv.</p>
<p>"The only proper use to be made of the blemishes which occur in the writings of such authors, [as Addison and Swift--authors whose 'faults are overbalanced by high beauties'--] is, to point out to those who apply themselves to the study of composition, some of the rules which they ought to observe for avoiding such errors; and to render them sensible of the necessity of strict attention to language and style."--<i>Blair's Rhet.</i>, p. 233.</p>

<p>"In a vigorous exertion of memory, ideal presence is exceedingly distinct: thus, when a man, entirely occupied with some event that made a deep impression, forgets himself, he perceives every thing as passing before him, and has a consciousness of presence, similar to that of a spectator."--<i>Kames, El. of Crit.</i>, i, 88.</p>
<p>"Each planet revolves about its own axis in a given time; and each moves round the sun, in an orbit nearly circular, and in a time proportioned to its distance.

<p>"The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh come; and unto him shall the gathering of the people be."--<i>Gen.</i>, xlix, 10.</p>
<p>"Again, ye have heard that it hath been said by them of old time, thou shalt not forswear thyself, but shalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths. But I say unto you, Swear not at all: neither by heaven; for it is God's throne: nor by the earth; for it is his footstool: neither by Jerusalem; for it is the city of the great King. Neither shalt thou swear by thy head; because thou canst not make one hair white or black."--<i>Matt.</i>, v, 33--36.</p>
<p>"Refined manners, and polite behaviour, must not be deemed altogether artificial: men who, inured to the sweets of society, cultivate humanity, find an elegant pleasure in preferring others, and making them happy, of which the proud, the selfish, scarcely have a conception."--<i>Kames, El. of</i> Crit.<i>, i, 105.</i></p>

<p>[FORMULE.--Not proper, because the relation here intended, between <i>are</i> formed <i>and</i> participles<i>, is not well signified by the preposition by.</i> But, according to Observation 7th, on this part of speech, "The prepositions have, from their own nature, or from custom, such an adaptation to particular terms and relations, that they can seldom be used one for an other without manifest impropriety."

CHAPTER XI--INTERJECTIONS.</p>
<p>An Interjection is a word that is uttered merely to indicate some strong or sudden emotion of the mind: as, <i>Oh! alas! ah! poh! pshaw! avaunt! aha!</i> hurrah!</p>
<p><br>
OBSERVATIONS.</p>
<p>OBS. 1.--Of pure interjections but few are admitted into books. Unimpassioned writings reject this part of speech altogether. As words or sounds of this kind serve rather to indicate feeling than to express thought, they seldom have any definable signification. Their use also is so variable, that there can be no very accurate classification of them. Some significant words, perhaps more properly belonging to other classes, are sometimes ranked with interjections, when uttered with emotion and in an unconnected manner; as, <i>strange! prodigious! indeed!</i> Wells says, "<i>Other</i> parts of speech<i>, used by way of exclamation, are</i> properly regarded as interjections<i>; as,</i> hark! surprising! mercy!<i>"--</i>School Gram.<i>, 1846, p.</i> 110. This is an evident absurdity; because it directly confounds the classes which it speaks of as being different. Nor is it right to say, "<i>Other parts of speech</i> are frequently used <i>to perform the office</i> of interjections."--<i>Wells</i>, 1850, p. 120.</p>
<p>OBS. 2.--The word <i>interjection</i> comes to us from the Latin name <i>interjectio</i>, the root of which is the verb <i>interjicio</i>, to throw between, to interject. Interjections are so called because they are usually thrown in between <i>the parts of discourse</i>, without any syntactical connexion with other words. Dr. Lowth, in his haste, happened to describe them as a kind of natural sounds "thrown in between the parts <i>of a</i> sentence<i>;" and this strange blunder has been copied into almost every</i> definition that has been given of the Interjection since. See Murray's Grammar and others. Webster's Dictionary defines it as, "A word thrown in between <i>words connected in construction</i>;" but of all the parts of speech none are less frequently found in this situation.</p>
<p>OBS. 3.--The following is a fair sample of "Smith's <i>New Grammar</i>,"--i.e., of "English Grammar on the <i>Productive System</i>,"--a new effort of quackery to scarf up with cobwebs the eyes of common sense: "Q. When I exclaim, 'Oh! I have ruined my friend,' 'Alas! I fear for life,' <i>which words</i> here appear to be thrown in <i>between the sentences</i>, to express passion or feeling? Ans. <i>Oh! Alas!</i> Q. What does <i>interjection</i> mean? Ans. <i>Thrown</i> between<i>. Q. What name, then, shall we give such words as</i> oh! alas! &amp;c.<i>?</i> Ans. INTERJECTIONS. Q. What, then, are interjections? Ans. Interjections are words thrown in <i>between the parts of sentences</i>, to express the passions or sudden feelings of the speaker. Q. How may an interjection generally be known? Ans. By <i>its taking</i> an exclamation <i>point</i> after it: [as,] '<i>Oh!</i> I have alienated my friend.'"--<i>R. C. Smith's New Gram.</i>, p. 39. Of the interjection, this author gives, in his examples for parsing, <i>fifteen</i> other instances; but nothing can be more obvious, than that not more than one of the whole fifteen stands either "between sentences" or between the parts of any sentence! (See <i>New Gram.</i>, pp. 40 and 96.) Can he be a competent grammarian, who does not know the meaning of <i>between</i>; or who, knowing it, misapplies so very plain a word?</p>
<p>OBS. 4.--The Interjection, which is idly claimed by sundry writers to have been the first of words at the origin of language, is now very constantly set down, among the parts of speech, as the last of the series. But, for the name of this the last of the ten sorts of words, some of our grammarians have adopted the term <i>exclamation</i>. Of the old and usual term <i>interjection</i>, a recent writer justly says, "This name is preferable to that of <i>exclamation</i>, for some exclamations are not interjections, and some interjections are not exclamations."--GIBBS: <i>Fowler's E. Gram.</i>, §333.</p>
<p><br>
LIST OF THE INTERJECTIONS.</p>
<p>The following are the principal interjections, arranged according to the emotions which they are generally intended to indicate:--1. Of joy; <i>eigh!</i> hey! io!<i>--2. Of sorrow;</i> oh! ah! hoo! alas! alack! lackaday! welladay! <i>or</i> <i>welaway!</i>--3. Of wonder; <i>heigh! ha! strange! indeed!</i>--4. Of wishing, earnestness, or vocative address; (often with a noun or pronoun in the nominative absolute;) <i>O!</i>--5. Of praise; <i>well-done! good! bravo!</i>--6. Of surprise with disapproval; <i>whew! hoity-toity! hoida! zounds! what!</i>--7. Of pain or fear; <i>oh! ooh! ah! eh! O dear!</i>--8. Of contempt; <i>fudge! pugh!</i> poh! pshaw! pish! tush! tut! humph!<i>--9. Of aversion;</i> foh! faugh! fie! fy! foy!<i>[318]--10. Of expulsion;</i> out! off! shoo! whew! begone! avaunt! aroynt!<i>--11. Of calling aloud;</i> ho! soho! what-ho! hollo! holla! hallo! halloo! hoy! ahoy!<i>--12. Of exultation;</i> ah! aha! huzza! hey! heyday! hurrah!<i>--13. Of laughter;</i> ha, ha, ha; he, he, he; te-hee, te-hee.<i>--14.</i> Of salutation; <i>welcome! hail! all-hail!</i>--15. Of calling to attention; <i>ho! lo! la! law![319] look! see! behold! hark!</i>--16. Of calling to silence; <i>hush! hist! whist! 'st! aw! mum!</i>--17. Of dread or horror; <i>oh!</i> ha! hah! what!<i>--18. Of languor or weariness;</i> heigh-ho! heigh-ho-hum!<i>--19. Of stopping;</i> hold! soft! avast! whoh!<i>--20. Of</i> parting; <i>farewell! adieu! good-by! good-day!</i>--21. Of knowing or detecting; <i>oho! ahah! ay-ay!</i>--22. Of interrogating; <i>eh? ha? hey?</i>[320]</p>
<p><br>
OBSERVATIONS.</p>
<p>OBS. 1.--With the interjections, may perhaps be reckoned <i>hau</i> and <i>gee</i>, the imperative words of teamsters driving cattle; and other similar sounds, useful under certain circumstances, but seldom found in books. Besides these, and all the foregoing, there are several others, too often heard, which are unworthy to be considered parts of a cultivated language. The frequent use of interjections savours more of thoughtlessness than of sensibility. Philosophical writing and dispassionate discourse exclude them altogether. Yet are there several words of this kind, which in earnest utterance, animated poetry, or impassioned declamation, are not only natural, but exceedingly expressive: as, "Lift up thy voice, <i>O</i> daughter of Gallim; cause it to be heard unto Laish, <i>O</i> poor Anathoth."--<i>Isaiah</i>, x, 30. "<i>Alas, alas</i>, that great city Babylon, that mighty city! for in one hour is thy judgement come."--<i>Rev.</i>, xviii, 10.</p>
<pre>  "<i>Ah me!</i> forbear, returns the queen, forbear;
   <i>Oh!</i> talk not, talk not of vain beauty's care."
       --<i>Odyssey</i>, B. xviii, l. 310.
</pre>
<p>OBS. 2.--Interjections, being in general little else than mere natural voices or cries, must of course be adapted to the sentiments which are uttered with them, and never carelessly confounded one with an other when we express them on paper. The adverb <i>ay</i> is sometimes improperly written for the interjection <i>ah</i>; as, <i>ay me!</i> for <i>ah me!</i> and still oftener we find <i>oh</i>, an interjection of sorrow, pain, or surprise,[321] written in stead of <i>O</i>, the proper sign of wishing, earnestness, or vocative address: as,</p>
<pre>  "<i>Oh</i> Happiness! our being's end and aim!"
       --<i>Pope, Ess. Ep.</i> iv, l. 1.
</pre>
<pre>   "And peace, <i>oh</i> Virtue! peace is all thy own."
       --<i>Id., ib., Ep.</i> iv, l. 82.
</pre>
<pre>   "<i>Oh</i> stay, O pride of Greece! Ulysses, stay!
   O cease thy course, and listen to our lay!"
       --<i>Odys.</i>, B. xii, 1 222.
</pre>
<p>OBS. 3.--The chief characteristics of the interjection are independence, exclamation, and the want of any definable signification. Yet not all the words or signs which we refer to this class, will be found to coincide in all these marks of an interjection. Indeed the last, (the want of a rational meaning,) would seem to exclude them from the language; for <i>words</i> must needs be significant of something. Hence many grammarians deny that mere sounds of the voice have any more claim to be reckoned among the parts of speech, than the neighing of a horse, or the lowing of a cow. There is some reason in this; but in fact the reference which these sounds have to the feelings of those who utter them, is to some extent instinctively understood; and does constitute a sort of significance, though we cannot really define it. And, as their use in language, or in connexion with language, makes it necessary to assign them a place in grammar, it is certainly more proper to treat them as above, than to follow the plan of the Greek grammarians, most of whom throw all the interjections into the class of <i>adverbs</i>.</p>
<p>OBS. 4.--Significant words uttered independently, after the manner of interjections, ought in general, perhaps, to be referred to their original classes; for all such expressions may be supposed elliptical: as, "<i>Order!</i> gentlemen, <i>order!</i>" i.e., "Come to order,"--or, "Keep order." "<i>Silence!</i>" i.e., "Preserve silence." "<i>Out! out!</i>" i.e., "Get out,"--or, "Clear out!" (See Obs. 5th and 6th, upon Adverbs.)</p>
<pre>  "Charge, Chester, charge! <i>On</i>, Stanley, <i>on</i>!
   Were the last words of Marmion."--<i>Scott</i>.
</pre>
<p>OBS. 5.--In some instances, interjections seem to be taken substantively and made nouns; as,</p>
<pre>  "I may sit in a corner, and cry <i>hey-ho</i> for a husband."--<i>Shak</i>.
</pre>
<p>So, according to James White, in his Essay on the Verb, is the word <i>fie</i>, in the following example:</p>
<pre>  "If you deny me, <i>fie</i> upon your law."--SHAK.: <i>White's Verb</i>, p. 163.

<p>ERRORS RESPECTING INTERJECTIONS.</p>
<p>"Of chance or change, oh let not man complain."--<i>Bucke's Classical Gram.</i>, p. 85.</p>
