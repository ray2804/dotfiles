Accordingly, we can argue that the "modern English" is not equivalent to the very big set of word sequences in our imaginary corpus. Speakers of English can make judgements about these sequences, and will reject some of them as being ungrammatical.

Equally, it is easy to compose a new sentence and have speakers agree that it is perfectly good English. For example, sentences have an interesting property that they can be embedded inside larger sentences. Consider the following sentences:

(1)
a.		Usain Bolt broke the 100m record
b.		The Jamaica Observer reported that Usain Bolt broke the 100m record
c.		Andre said The Jamaica Observer reported that Usain Bolt broke the 100m record
d.		I think Andre said the Jamaica Observer reported that Usain Bolt broke the 100m record
If we replaced whole sentences with the symbol S, we would see patterns like Andre said S and I think S. These are templates for taking a sentence and constructing a bigger sentence. There are other templates we can use, like S but S, and S when S. With a bit of ingenuity we can construct some really long sentences using these templates. Here's an impressive example from a Winnie the Pooh story by A.A. Milne, In which Piglet is Entirely Surrounded by Water:
