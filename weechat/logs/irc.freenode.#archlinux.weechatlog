2013-08-31 02:21:39	buhman	someone just literally told me that 1) a screw on their laptop is slightly loose 2) they have 'no idea how to fix that'
2013-08-31 02:22:01	Jaaks	Hey guys, quick question. My laptop loses internet connection anytime another device on the wireless network isn't ULing/DLing. I've tried googling this issue, and searched the Wiki, but wasn't quite sure what exactly to be looking for, as I don't know what the issue would be called. Any ideas?

2013-08-31 05:24:29	RawSushi	I always did like KDE and gnome back in the day...every time I check out the latest versions I'm unimpressed.
2013-08-31 05:24:52	RawSushi	gnome doesn't seem to be nearly as customizable as it used to be.
2013-08-31 05:25:15	Irishluck83	i'm on kde and like it....i just tried gnome two days ago and it crashed like almost at once
2013-08-31 05:25:22	velusip	This 2wire switch likes to drop link on this one machine... both work fine with every other host and every other switch.  Long night ahead!
2013-08-31 05:25:25	Boohbah	RawSushi: that is a DPMS issue
2013-08-31 05:25:48	Boohbah	!give RawSushi wiki DPMS
2013-08-31 05:25:50	phrik	RawSushi: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Display_Power_Management_Signaling
2013-08-31 05:26:05	RawSushi	But what I'm thinking about doing is jumping on fvwm or something like that and just build it up from scratch...build my own little desktop environment with it.
2013-08-31 05:26:16	NoXzema	!no
2013-08-31 05:26:17	RawSushi	fvwm is an excellent choice for that because you can do almost anything with it.

2013-08-31 05:27:27	RawSushi	are there any other window managers like that?  That start out as nothing and are highly customizable?
2013-08-31 05:27:35	velusip	only have to configure an idea window environment once.  Last time I did it was 2009.
2013-08-31 05:28:20	brisbin	RawSushi: you need to decide tiling v floating first
2013-08-31 05:28:57	RawSushi	Well tiling is great...Once I discovered tiling that's pretty much my favorite.  But I get bored with it sometimes...I like eye candy/graphics
2013-08-31 05:28:59	Boohbah	i3, subtle, dwm, xmonad, awesome, etc.
2013-08-31 05:29:01	voidfire	dwm rocks..
2013-08-31 05:29:08	brisbin	xmonad for example is tiling, and is a library for writing a wm which just happens to ship with one possible implementation
2013-08-31 05:29:11	voidfire	awesome is nice..but fck luA
2013-08-31 05:29:12	RawSushi	I am into osx type desktops
2013-08-31 05:29:12	brisbin	so that fits the bill
2013-08-31 05:29:21	RawSushi	but for the most part tiling is what I like

2013-08-31 08:29:53	zendeavor	Apsu: note that if you have a script which contains no executable code (calls to functions or external commands) then it should probably be given an extension (but one that signifies exactly what it extends, in this case bash)

I actually have only around 1.3GB RAM used but free with buffers show 6.4 mem used

2013-09-03 17:44:53	Apsu	But in the general case, any given package has some set of behavior which comprises it "working".

2013-09-03 17:45:02	Apsu	Dependencies are identified as preventing said behavior if missing.
2013-09-03 17:45:10	Hwkiller	in ranger, if I want the functionality to preview images that aren't ascii, I have to install w3m. That is optional. If I don't have it, ascii is used. If I do have it, images are used. How is that not then an optional dependency in every sense of the word?
2013-09-03 17:45:40	Apsu	Obviously you can write code to dynamically load modules, or read config files, or any number of other dynamic behavior, which you could consider to be the general functionality, and those things could be separately packaged.
2013-09-03 17:45:48	Apsu	But that's not the *generally accepted* meaning of dependency.

If I was entering something in "run or raise", I can't continue typing. And ...
