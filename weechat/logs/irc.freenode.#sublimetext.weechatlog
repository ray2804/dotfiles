2012-12-28 00:16:46	supersym	ola... is there anyone good at regex that can help me fix a bug in syntax file?
2012-12-28 00:17:09	supersym	for sublime highlight ofc :P
2012-12-28 00:18:59	Foxboron	supersym, well. I could prolly help you determin the regex used, but i am bad at the whole regex stuff myself :P
2012-12-28 00:19:23	supersym	ah.. shame I more or less pinpointed it as well
2012-12-28 00:19:30	supersym	but it's a multiline
2012-12-28 00:19:38	supersym	and then my head breaks :)
2012-12-28 00:20:00	Foxboron	Well, i use online regex sites and mess witht he syntax until i get the right result
2012-12-28 00:20:03	supersym	thanks anyway... i should really poke the package maintainer
2012-12-28 00:23:43	supersym	Jade rules is that element say p . (pee space period) is a literal and p. would constitute a valid Text value for the HTML node
2012-12-28 00:24:40	supersym	as long as the following lines are indented +1 so sublime needs to detect that and treat all the following lines untill the indent jumps back 1 level as comments, and now it just things they are elements
2012-12-28 00:25:08	supersym	interesting but a bit to complicated for me even with a regex site

2012-12-28 01:44:29	codepython777	I just installed the jinja plugin. Then tried to Edit->line->reindent , but i dont see any indentation after {% if ... -- anyone using ST2 for editing jinja? 
2012-12-28 01:51:28	_aegis_	I use sublime for jinja
2012-12-28 01:51:34	_aegis_	I do my indentation by hand though
2012-12-28 01:51:46	_aegis_	because [ ] for indents is really fast
2012-12-28 01:51:52	_aegis_	you sure the syntax mode is right?

2012-12-28 01:57:17	codepython777	_aegis_: how do i check and change that?
2012-12-28 01:57:29	_aegis_	bottom right
2012-12-28 01:58:37	codepython777	_aegis_: was wrong edit mode. But with jinja selected, autoindent is horrible. worse than with html.
2012-12-28 01:58:44	_aegis_	:D
2012-12-28 02:00:13	codepython777	_aegis_: does your show two options in edit mode for jinja as well? (jinja2 and html(jinja templates))?
2012-12-28 02:00:22	_aegis_	please stop highlighting me :P
2012-12-28 02:00:31	_aegis_	and yes.
2012-12-28 02:00:46	codepython777	thanks.
