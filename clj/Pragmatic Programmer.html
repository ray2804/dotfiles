<h2>Java Virtual Machine - Overview</h2>
<div class="line"></div>
<div class="articleBody clear">
<p>
                        At the heart of Java resides the JVM - the abstract computer on which
                        all Java programs run. There are four distinct but interrelated components.<br>

                        JVM -- API -- Class Files -- Java Language <br>

<p>
<strong><u>What is JVM:</u></strong>
JVM is the core of Java technology.It is the machine on which every java program is supposed to run.                          In different words Java virtual machine is an abstract computer. Its specification defines                                              certain features every Java virtual machine must have but leaves several options and choices to the designers of
each implementation. For example, although all the JVMs must execute Java bytecodes, the specific technique to execute is decided by that particular implementation. The specification is flexible and it can be implemented using software and hardware both.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><u>Main Task of JVM:</u></strong> There are two main tasks of the JVM. To load the class files and execute the byte codes they contain. To load the class files the JVM has a Class Loader, and to execute the bytecodes they contain it has Execution Engine.
The following diagram depicts the block diagram of the Java virtual machine.<br>

<br>
<p><b><u>Class Loader:</u></b>  The main task of a class loader is to load classes for the execution engine. JVM has a flexible class loader architecture which allows having more than one class loader.  It also allows the programs to load classes in custom ways.  In general sense there are two kinds of class loaders. The <i>bootstrap class loader</i> and  <i>user defined class loader</i>. There is only one bootstrap class loader and it comes with the JVM. For example, if a JVM is implemented as a C program on top of an existing operating system, then the bootstrap class loader will be part of that C program. The bootstrap class loader handles the responsibility of loading the classes, including the classes of the Java API.
<br>
User defined class loaders can be installed by Java applications which allow users to load classes in custom ways, such as loading classes over the network. These class loaders are not the internal part of JVM. They are written in Java, compiled to class files like other ordinary java files, loaded into the virtual machine, and instantiated just like any other object.  These user defined class loaders gives the flexibility of deciding which class to load at runtime, giving the ability to extend your Java program dynamically at run time.
<br>
The JVM keeps track of all the classes loaded and which class loader loaded the class. Also, in a system where multiple classes are loaded, only those classes which were loaded by a particular class loader are visible to it. No other class is visible to the class loader. This is one kind of security provided by JVM architecture where unwanted access to classes is prohibited.
<br>
<b><u>Execution Engine:</u></b> This varies for different JVM implementation. The simplest kind just interprets one bytecode at a time. Then there is another kind called <i>just-in-time-compiler</i> which is a bit faster and requires more memory.  In this kind, the bytecodes of methods are compiled to the native machine codes for the first time they are called. The native machine code for the methods is then cached, so that when that method is called again, it can be reused. This makes this kind of execution engines faster. The third kind is <i>adaptive optimizer</i>. In this kind along with interpreting bytecodes, the engine keeps monitoring the running program for identifying the most frequently used areas of the running code. Now only those codes are optimized which are used heavily.

		Each Java application runs inside its own JVM instance. When a Java application starts, a new run-time instance is created and that 				       instance has only one task to run only that application. That means, if you start five Java applications at the same time,
		 five separate instances of JVMs will be created and each of those instances will run the respective Java application only.
